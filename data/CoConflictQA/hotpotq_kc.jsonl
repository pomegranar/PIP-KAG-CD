It is part of the renin-angiotensin system, which is a major target for drugs that raises blood pressure.  Angiotensin also stimulates the release of aldosterone, another hormone, from the adrenal cortex.  Aldosterone promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron, in the kidney, which also drives blood pressure up. \n  Aldosterone  Aldosterone, the main mineralocorticoid hormone, is a steroid hormone produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland.  It is essential for sodium conservation in the kidney, salivary glands, sweat glands and colon.  It plays a central role in the regulation of the plasma sodium (Na), the extracellular potassium (K) and arterial blood pressure.  It does so mainly by acting on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron.  It influences the reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium (from and into the tubular fluids, respectively) of the kidney, thereby indirectly influencing water retention or loss, blood pressure and blood volume.

Present were the Russian and Austro-Hungarian emperors together with their foreign ministers, Prince Gorchakov of Russia and Count Andrassy of Austria-Hungary.  The closed meeting took place on July 8 in the Bohemian city of Reichstadt (now Zákupy).  They agreed on a common approach to the solution of the Eastern question, due to the unrest in the Ottoman Empire and the interests of the two major powers in the Balkans.  They discussed the likely Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, its possible outcomes and what should happen under each scenario. \n  League of the Three Emperors  The Three Caesars' Alliance or League of the Three Emperors (German: \"Dreikaiserabkommen\" , Russian: Союз трёх императоров ) was an alliance between the German Empire, the Russian Empire and Austria-Hungary, from 1873 to 1887.  Chancellor Otto von Bismarck took full charge of German foreign policy from 1870 to his dismissal in 1890.  His goal was a peaceful Europe, based on the balance of power.  Bismarck feared that a hostile combination of Austria, France and Russia would crush Germany.  If two of them were allied, then the third would ally with Germany only if Germany conceded excessive demands.  The solution was to ally with two of the three.  In 1873 he formed the League of the Three Emperors, an alliance of the Kaiser of Germany, the Tsar of Russia, and the Kaiser of Austria-Hungary.  Together they would control Eastern Europe, making sure that restive ethnic groups such as the Poles were kept in control.  It aimed at neutralizing the rivalry between Germany’s two neighbors by an agreement over their respective spheres of influence in the Balkans and at isolating Germany’s enemy, France.

It is typically associated with independent artists, signed to independent labels or no label at all.  Underground hip hop is often characterized by socially conscious, positive, or anti-commercial lyrics.  However, there is no unifying or universal theme – AllMusic suggests that it \"has no sonic signifiers\".  \"The Underground\" also refers to the community of musicians, fans and others that support non-commercial, or independent music.  Music scenes with strong ties to underground hip hop include alternative hip hop and conscious hip hop.  Many artists who are considered \"underground\" today were not always so, and may have previously broken the \"Billboard\" charts. \n  Political hip hop  Political hip hop is a subgenre of hip hop music that was developed in the 1980s as a way of turning rap music into a call for action and a form of social activism.  Inspired by 1970s political preachers such as The Last Poets and musician Gil Scott-Heron, Public Enemy was the first predominately political hip-hop group.  It has helped to create a new form of social expression for subordinate groups to speak about their exclusions, injustices and lack of power.  Political hip-hop is the use of hip hop music to send political messages to inspire action or to convince the listener of a particular worldview.

The school consisted of Anaxagoras, Archelaus, and Empedocles.  It can also be said to have included the Atomists, Leucippus and Democritus.  The Pluralists rejected the idea that the diversity of nature can be reduced to a single principle (monism).

BCE) is reported in some ancient sources to have been a philosopher who was the earliest Greek to develop the theory of atomism—the idea that everything is composed entirely of various imperishable, indivisible elements called atoms. Leucippus often appears as the master to his pupil Democritus, a philosopher also touted as the originator of the atomic theory.  However, a brief notice in Diogenes Laertius’s life of Epicurus says that on the testimony of Epicurus, Leucippus never existed.  As the philosophical heir of Democritus, Epicurus's word has some weight, and indeed a controversy over this matter raged in German scholarship for many years at the close of the 19th century.  Furthermore, in his \"Corpus Democriteum\", Thrasyllus of Alexandria, an astrologer and writer living under the emperor Tiberius (14–37 CE), compiled a list of writings on atomism that he attributed to Democritus to the exclusion of Leucippus.
