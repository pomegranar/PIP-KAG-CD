{"question": "Where did he go to college?", "answers": ["in Missouri"], "context": "BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- Jeffrey Jamaleldine took a bullet to his chin that blew out much of his jaw and nearly killed him while deployed in Iraq last year. The sacrifice is just part of his job, he says, and he'd go back to Iraq in a second if asked.\n\n\n\nJeffrey Jamaleldine left Germany for college in America. In 2006, he joined the U.S. Army.\n\n\n\nThat is something that troubles his family, especially his father. Jamaleldine served in the U.S. Army as a German citizen, one of an estimated 20,500 \"green-card warriors\" in the military.\n\n\n\nLast month, Jamaleldine was awarded U.S. citizenship, but he's keeping his German passport.\n\n\n\nBashir Jamaleldine says his son is fighting an unjust war for an America that went too far when it invaded Iraq five years ago -- a sentiment shared by the majority of Germans. He wishes his son would get back to his \"German roots.\"\n\n\n\n\"It would satisfy me more. Why he's more American than a German, I don't know,\" he says.\n\n\n\nOf his son's time in Iraq, the father says, \"He went there to receive this bullet. If he would not have gone there, he wouldn't have been wounded; he wouldn't be in the hospital; he wouldn't be treated by a doctor. He would be living in peace with his family.\"\n\n\n\nShaking his head with his son at his side, he adds, \"He is more American than German.\"\n\n\n\nJeffrey Jamaleldine, a 31-year-old U.S. Army scout who proudly wears a Stetson hat and spurs on his boots, laughs. He says he and his dad have had countless arguments over his decision to join the U.S. military, but the two never budge from their positions.  See his shattered jaw and debate with his dad »\n\n\n\n\"He hears what I'm saying, but there's just no coming through,\" he says.\n\n\n\nThe father came to Germany from Africa years ago. He says his son should be devoting his energy to fighting hunger and poverty in Africa, not fighting in Iraq.\n\n\n\nThe son agrees with his father on one thing: His love for America is unwavering. Jeffrey Jamaleldine moved to the United States to go to college in Missouri at the age of 18 and immediately fell in love with the United States and its culture.\n\n\n\n\"You can go from rags to riches there. People still believe in that. It is not something that has gotten lost,\" he says.\n\n\n\nAnd when the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, happened, he felt it was time for him to do something.\n\n\n\n\"A small group of people [terrorists] -- I felt -- had a big influence on our way of life and that literally pissed me off,\" he says.\n\n\n\nBy accident, he says he found out that with his green card, he could join the U.S. military. And in 2006, he did just that. Read why a \"green-card\" Marine would die for America\n\n\n\nLast year, he paid a heavy price for his patriotism. Pinned down in a firefight with insurgents in the Iraqi city of Ramadi, Jamaleldine was shot in the face.\n\n\n\n\"I felt like I got hit by Mike Tyson,\" he says, pointing to a two-inch long scar on his left cheek.\n\n\n\nThe left side his jaw was shattered and now doctors at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany are reconstructing his facial bones.\n\n\n\n\"Part of the projectile is still stuck in the right cheekbone,\" Dr. Edward Vanisky says. \"But if it doesn't cause you any problems, we'll just leave it in there.\"\n\n\n\nWhile many Americans would consider Jamaleldine a hero, most in his home country don't. Germans largely oppose the Iraq war. The criticism doesn't bother him.

{"question": "Which gene did the ALS association discover?", "answers": ["ALS6,"], "context": "(CNN) -- Researchers announced this week that they've found a new gene, ALS6, which is responsible for about 5 percent of hereditary Lou Gehrig's cases.\n\n\n\nThe discovery of a new gene mutation may allow those with ALS in their family to be tested.\n\n\n\nIt's being called a \"momentous discovery\" by the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis  Association.\n\n\n\nScientists at Massachusetts General Hospital, the University of Massachusetts and Kings College in London found the mutation by doing detailed sequencing of the genes in several families with an inherited form of ALS. The findings are published in the February 27 issue of the journal Science and were partially funded by the ALS Association.\n\n\n\nALS, a disease of the nervous system, impairs muscle movement and eventually results in total paralysis. It was brought to national attention in 1939, when famed Yankee baseball player Lou Gehrig's illness was diagnosed as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. Today, the disease is most commonly known by his name.\n\n\n\nALS6 is a protein normally found inside a cell's nucleus, but in patients with Lou Gehrig's disease, it is found outside the nucleus and sometimes forms unusual clumps.\n\n\n\nALS researchers are unsure why this occurs but believe this finding, combined with a gene they discovered last year, TDP-43, may lead them to a firmer idea of what causes this deadly disease.\n\n\n\nBoth genes help in building and transporting proteins and making sure they're in the right place in cell structure -- a process called RNA processing.\n\n\n\nLucie Bruijn, senior vice president of research and development at the ALS Association, likens this process to building an engine: If there are parts missing or placed in the wrong place or in the wrong way, the engine doesn't work right.\n\n\n\n\"Everything has an exquisite role and has to be in the right place, and any imbalance ... can cause things to go awry,\" Bruijn said.\n\n\n\n\"It's exciting because what it's starting to tell us now is that we might be starting to get an underlying theme,\" Bruijn said. \"We now have two genes with similar function strengthening the idea that alterations in RNA processing is important in ALS. A completely new direction and also involved in many other neurodegenerative diseases.\"\n\n\n\nShe believes this gives researchers \"huge\" potential to develop new therapies.\n\n\n\nAnd new therapies are needed.\n\n\n\nThere is no cure and only one treatment for ALS, a neurodegenerative disease that seems to progressively attack the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. These attacks can cause symptoms such as muscle weakness, twitching, cramping and thick speech, eventually leading to paralysis. According to the ALS Association, the disease strikes a little more than 5,600 people every year, and about 10 percent of those cases are hereditary.\n\n\n\nThe discovery of this new gene mutation will also allow those with ALS in their family to be tested for another gene (this makes three genes). Bruijn says a test \"will be possible; however, currently, it is not widely accessible\" and \"it would only be used in familial ALS patients.\"", "parametric_answer": "sod1", "parametric_answer_freq": 5, "parametric_evidencde": "The ALS Association discovered the SOD1 gene as the first gene associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)."}

{"question": "When do the decorations go up?", "answers": ["July"], "context": "(Southern Living) -- For a heady dose of holiday spirit, dive into Opryland.\n\n\n\nFifteen miles of green garland and 10 miles of hand-tied red ribbon festoon the property.\n\n\n\nI've heard that you can see the Great Wall of China from outer space. At Christmastime, I bet you can also see Gaylord Opryland. It sparkles with megawatts of lights, fun, and merriment. But you don't have to be shot into orbit to enjoy the view of this Nashville treasure. Make the easy drive to Middle Tennessee and delight in this perfectly luminous getaway.\n\n\n\nThe one must-see\n\n\n\nMany holiday activities raise your spirits; one really promises to chill you out. Most of you have read or seen \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas!\" But you haven't had the ultimate Dr. Seuss experience until you meet the green grump carved in ice. Put on a parka -- loaned to you upon admission -- and enter ICE!, a frozen world located in the Gaslight Theater. The attraction will be back next year, but this is the last time you'll see the Grinch and Who-ville, carved by Chinese craftsmen from huge, brilliantly hued blocks of ice. There are even frigid sliding boards to try. Afterward, leave the 18-degree area, and grab a cup of hot chocolate in the adjoining gift shop. Are you smiling yet?\n\n\n\nSpecial happenings\n\n\n\nIt's the 25th year the resort has provided a Santa's bagful of activities and entertainment. The decorations begin going up in July for A Country Christmas, and the festivities run from mid-November until the holidays end. During that time, enjoy delights such as carriage rides, photos with Santa, the Hall of Trees, and the Treasures for the Holidays Craft Show. Just admiring all the lights, poinsettias, and \"faux-piaries\" -- animal-shaped topiaries -- will get your inner Rudolph aglow. Southern Living: Tips from a repeat Oprylander\n\n\n\nThe Radio City Music Hall Rockettes high-kick from the Grand Ole Opry stage. Wear your Christmas sweater and jeans while you watch them -- everyone else does. For a memento of your visit, add glitter and sparkle to a fragrant miniature holiday house at Gingerbread Corner. Special events also include Louise Mandrell's \"Joy to the World Christmas Dinner & Show,\" as well as a Winter Wonderland that includes a train ride for little ones. Near the hotel, board the General Jackson showboat for a dinner cruise on the Cumberland River. SouthernLiving.com: Hot Spots for the New Year\n\n\n\nDining and shopping\n\n\n\nYou have many options for meals in the huge Gaylord Opryland complex. For a fine-dining experience, try Old Hickory Steakhouse. Indulge in a rich lobster bisque, perfectly cooked filet mignon, and crème brûlée. Water's Edge Marketplace Buffet, located in the Delta Atrium, is a more casual venue. Graze among 60 different stations, filled with everything from pasta and salads to meats and vegetables. You can also grab a quick meal at Stax Burgers or Paisano's Pizzaria & Vino, both on the Delta Island.\n\n\n\nFor a nighttime dose of high-octane fun, go directly to the new Fuse nightclub, with rave reviews and visiting luminaries such as Kid Rock and Kim Kardashian. If you need festive duds, check out the shopping at Gaylord Opryland, such as Amelia's or Savannah's, both featuring dressy and casual women's clothing.\n\n\n\nOpry Mills, the outlet mall just down the road, offers some of the best shopping opportunities, with winning Tennessee stores such as The Gibson Showcase and The Apple Barn Cider Bar & General Store. The Disney Store Outlet and Build-A-Bear Workshop also mesmerize, while standbys such as Nike, Gap Outlet, and Tommy Hilfiger Company Store are perennial favorites.

{"question": "What was the number of suicide bombers?", "answers": ["two"], "context": "Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- An Afghan political figure considered vital to peace efforts in the country was assassinated Tuesday, officials said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBurhanuddin Rabbani, a former Afghan president who had been leading the Afghan peace council, was killed in an attack at his home.\n\n\n\n\n\nNATO's International Security Assistance Force said two suicide bombers, \"feigning a desire to conduct reconciliation talks, detonated themselves.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfghan officials earlier said there was one bomber.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe attacker hid the explosive device inside his turban, said Hasmat Stanikzai, spokesman for Kabul police.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Afghan intelligence source told CNN that the bomber arrived at the house at the same time a meeting was due to take place between Rabbani and a delegation representing the Taliban insurgency.\n\n\n\n\n\nStanikzai said the bomber claimed to be a Taliban member who had come for the talks about peace and reconciliation, and detonated the explosives as he entered the home.\n\n\n\n\n\nFour other people were wounded, including Masoom Stanikzai, a key adviser to Rabbani, the police spokesman said.\n\n\n\n\n\nA doctor at a 400-bed hospital in Kabul said, \"We have received three people from the blast at Rabbani's house. Among the injured are Masoom Stanikzai, one bodyguard and an assistant\" to Rabbani.\n\n\n\n\n\nRabbani was long considered crucial to Afghan and coalition efforts to bring Taliban leaders into the reconciliation process.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was also heading the United National Front Party, the largest political party that stands in opposition to President Hamid Karzai.\n\n\n\n\n\nKarzai called Rabbani's killing a \"very tragic loss\" for his country.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations in New York, Karzai described Rabbani as \"an Afghan patriot\" who \"has sacrificed his life for the sake of Afghanistan and for the peace of our country.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will miss him very much,\" Karzai said.\n\n\n\n\n\nKarzai cut short his time at the United Nations. His office said he would return to Afghanistan in the wake of the killing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said of the violence in Afghanistan, including Rabbani's assassination, \"We know that is the campaign the insurgents are on. We've got to adjust to that and protect the leaders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Someone is going to have to step in very quickly because that is a critical part of the peace process,\" Mullen said of Rabbani's role. The killing represents the strategy of the Taliban to assassinate as many leaders as possible, Mullen said.\n\n\n\n\n\nNATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen called the assassination \"an attack on the Afghan people as they begin to take their country's security in their own hands.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To those who offer only death and destruction to the Afghan people, our message is clear: You will not prevail,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nGen.

{"question": "What wa sthe name of the suspect?", "answers": ["Adam Yahiye Gadahn,"], "context": "(CNN) -- In a new anti-Israel, anti-U.S. video, an American al Qaeda member makes reference to his Jewish ancestry for the first time in an official al Qaeda message.\n\n\n\nAdam Yahiye Gadahn, also known as Azzam the American, is seen in an earlier al Qaeda video.\n\n\n\nIn the video, Adam Yahiye Gadahn, also known as Azzam the American, discusses his roots as he castigates U.S. policies and deplores Israel's offensive in Gaza that started in late December 2008 and continued into January.\n\n\n\n\"Let me here tell you something about myself and my biography, in which there is a benefit and a lesson,\" Gadahn says, as he elicits support from his fellow Muslims for \"our weapons, funds and Jihad against the Jews and their allies everywhere.\"\n\n\n\n\"Your speaker has Jews in his ancestry, the last of whom was his grandfather,\" he says.\n\n\n\nGrowing up in rural California, Gadahn embraced Islam in the mid-1990s, moved to Pakistan and has appeared in al Qaeda videos before.\n\n\n\nHe was indicted in the United States in 2006 on charges of treason and material support to al Qaeda, according to the FBI. Gadahn is on the FBI's Most Wanted List, with a reward of up to $1 million leading to his capture. FBI records show Gadahn's date of birth as September 1, 1978.\n\n\n\nThe video -- in which Gadahn speaks Arabic, with English subtitles -- surfaced on Saturday. This account is based on an English transcript provided by As-Sahab Media, the media production company used by al Qaeda.\n\n\n\nGadahn's Jewish ancestry has been reported in the news media. But terrorism analyst Laura Mansfield says it is the first time Gadahn acknowledged his Jewish ancestry in an official al Qaeda message.\n\n\n\nGadahn says his grandfather was a \"Zionist\" and \"a zealous supporter of the usurper entity, and a prominent member of a number of Zionist hate organizations.\"\n\n\n\n\"He used to repeat to me what he claimed are the virtues of this entity and encouraged me to visit it, specifically the city of Tel Aviv, where relatives of ours live,\" says Gadahn, referring to Israel.\n\n\n\nHe says his grandfather gave him a book by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called \"A Place Among the Nations\" -- in which the \"rabid Zionist\" sets out \"feeble arguments and unmasked lies to justify the Jews' rape of Muslim Palestine.\"\n\n\n\nBut Gadahn says that despite his youth at the time, he didn't heed his grandfather's words.\n\n\n\n\"How can a person with an ounce of self-respect possibly stand in the ranks of criminals and killers who have no morals, no mercy, no humanity and indeed, no honor?\" he says in reference to Zionists and Israel.\n\n\n\n\"Isn't it shameful enough for a person to carry the citizenship of America, the symbol of oppression and tyranny and advocate of terror in the world?\"\n\n\n\nMansfield thinks the video may have been made between late April and mid-May, before President Obama's speech in Cairo, Egypt, addressing U.S. relations with Muslims.\n\n\n\nGadahn notes Obama's inauguration, Netanyahu's election in February, and Obama's speech in Turkey in April.\n\n\n\nSpecifically mentioning the Gaza offensive and citing other hot spots such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Chechnya and Somalia, where the \"Zio-Crusader alliance\" is fighting his \"brothers,\" he says \"this open-faced aggression\" comes as Obama has risen to power.\n\n\n\nHe scorns Obama's statements in his inaugural address and in Turkey that America isn't and won't be at war with Islam, and \"other deceptive, false and sugarcoated words of endearment and respect.\" He says Obama's language is similar to words Netanyahu uttered in the Knesset in 1996.\n\n\n\nGadahn also backs the idea of targeting \"Zio-Crusader\" interests anywhere in the world, not just \"within Palestine.\"", "parametric_answer": "john", "parametric_answer_freq": 5, "parametric_evidencde": "I apologize, but you didn't provide a question for me to answer.

A radiology technologist directs you toward an imposing-looking machine. As you hold your breath, one bare breast at a time is tightly compressed between two flat panels and X-rayed.\n\n\n\nYou'll undress from the waist up for a mammogram; wearing two pieces, not a dress, makes it easier.\n\n\n\nIt's a scene that's been repeated more than 35 million times in the past year at certified mammogram facilities around the United States.\n\n\n\nNo matter what their age, race or medical history, the female patients probably shared a similar experience during the 20-minute procedure.\n\n\n\n\"Mammograms are known to be uncomfortable,\" concedes Dr. Sujatha Reddy, an Atlanta, Georgia,-based gynecologist. \"The harder they squeeze and squish that breast, the less tissue the X-rays have to go through and the more likely they are to find something.\"\n\n\n\nThe American Cancer Society reports two to four mammograms out of every 1,000 lead to a diagnosis of cancer. About 10 percent of women who have a mammogram will require more tests.\n\n\n\nAccuracy often depends on patient cooperation, but Reddy reveals there's another side as well: \"A mammogram is only going to be as good as the technician and the doctor who read it, so you want to go to a good place.\"\n\n\n\nA recent study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute reports that doctors reading mammograms miss an average of two in every 10 cases of breast cancer.\n\n\n\nMedical experts remind women that mammograms alone don't guarantee a clean bill of health.\n\n\n\n\"I wish I could say the mammogram could find 100 percent of breast cancers,\" Reddy said. \"I think we have to rely on having a clinical breast exam once a year at a health care provider and doing your self-breast exam on a monthly basis.\"\n\n\n\nReddy recommends having mammogram screenings at a reputable facility that is certified. She also suggests going to the same office every year so that old X-rays can be compared with new films.\n\n\n\nA convenient location is another factor that makes it more likely that someone will actually show up for an annual mammogram appointment.  Health Minute: Watch more on what to expect during a mammogram. »\n\n\n\nFear of discomfort is what often keeps some women away.\n\n\n\nReddy advises her patients to schedule a screening appointment for the early part of their menstrual cycle. \"The best time of your cycle to do a mammogram is going to be when your period is over, maybe the week after your period is done when the breasts are not going to be tender.\"\n\n\n\nCaffeinated coffee, tea and soft drinks may also contribute to tender, lumpy breasts. Experts recommend avoiding caffeine for a week before the procedure.\n\n\n\nBefore having any type of imaging test, the Cancer Society warns patients to tell technicians if they think they might be pregnant or are breast feeding.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, reveal any unusual breast symptoms or problems before a mammogram.\n\n\n\nThe screening requires women to undress from the waist up. You'll be given a disposable wrap to put around your shoulders and chest. Wearing a two-piece outfit will make the process easier and more convenient.\n\n\n\nTechnicians tell patients not to wear deodorant, antiperspirants, perfumes or powders. They might leave a residue that can be picked up on the X-rays, interfering with the results.\n\n\n\nAll mammogram facilities are required to issue results within 30 days, but many will contact patients within a week if there is a problem with the mammogram.\n\n\n\nThe Cancer Society recommends women 40 and older get a mammogram every year. Younger women may be advised to be screened earlier if there is a family history of breast cancer. E-mail to a friend\n\n\n\nJudy Fortin is a correspondent with CNN Medical News.

A hand wand used by a TSA officer beeped when it was waved over her breasts.\n\n\n\nHamlin told the officer she had nipple piercings, Allred said, and that officer called over another officer, who told her she would need to remove them.\n\n\n\n\"Ms. Hamlin did not want to remove her nipple piercings,\" Allred said, reading from a letter she sent TSA. \"After nipple rings are inserted, the skin can often heal around the piercing and the rings can be extremely difficult and painful to remove. In addition, once removed, the pierced skin may close up almost immediately, making it difficult and painful to reinsert the piercing.\"\n\n\n\nMore officers were called over, and the group grew to four male and two female TSA officers, according to Hamlin. Also, a small crowd of onlookers had started to gather. The officers insisted that Hamlin remove the nipple rings, Allred said.\n\n\n\n\"She felt humiliated by the scene that the TSA officers were making,\" Allred said.\n\n\n\n\"With tears streaming down her face, she again asked to show the piercings to a TSA officer instead of having to remove them.

Broken glass poses a problem for the police force's 20 German Shepherds and Belgian Shepherds, Hartwich said.\n\n\n\nIn addition, hooligans and vandals leave behind glass shards around New Year's Eve and during the city's famous Carnival celebrations.\n\n\n\nSo what's a dog to do?\n\n\n\nTheir handlers shelled out 60 euros -- $89 -- for shoes that are also worn by dogs who walk on ice in Alaska.\n\n\n\nDogs need a month of training to get used to wearing the shoes, Hartwich said.\n\n\n\n\"We have to condition the dogs to the shoes,\" he said.

{"question": "What does Jeanne Tripplehorn know about the movies?", "answers": ["can get."], "context": "(CNN) -- Jeanne Tripplehorn's movie is about women and breast cancer. And it's airing on Lifetime.\n\n\n\n\n\nUh oh, this could get weepy.\n\n\n\n\n\nTripplehorn, who has starred in cable show \"Big Love,\" knows how preachy and awkward cancer movies can get.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This was something different,\" she said, of the film ,which airs Monday at 9 p.m. \"I spoke with Lifetime and they wanted it to be a new approach and a new way of looking at cancer.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe actress has seen the disease's toll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Like all women, I had been affected,\" she said. \"Women in my family dealt with breast cancer. They all survived. It was important for me to do this on a lot of different levels. It wasn't just a paycheck.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe movie, \"Five\" tells stories of different women coping with breast cancer in five vignettes. Tripplehorn's character, an oncologist is the tie that binds the five stories together. Her character loses her mother to breast cancer as a young girl and becomes an oncologist.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project has a bevy of star power. The executive producers are Jennifer Aniston, Marta Kauffman, co-creator of the series \"Friends\" and Kristin Hahn, who was the executive producer of \"The Departed.\" Aniston, Demi Moore and Alicia Keys each directed one of the vignettes. The ensemble cast includes Patricia Clarkson, Rosario Dawson, Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Holloway, Tracee Ellis Ross, Tony Shalhoub and Jeffrey Tambor.\n\n\n\n\n\nTripplehorn answered a few questions for CNN not long ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN: Did you work with an oncologist, or consult a doctor for your role?\n\n\n\n\n\nTripplehorn: I consulted an oncologist. I read a lot.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe thing that I found confusing and frustrating is once you have this diagnosis, there is this maze of doctors.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere wasn't one particular way of dealing with a diagnosis. I was just very confused to the journey that one takes after a diagnosis. You have your mammogram, your radiologist, your oncologist.\n\n\n\n\n\nJen [Aniston] and her producing partner Kristin [Hahn] toured a clinic that hopefully will become a model for clinics across the country. It's almost a one-stop shop with everything a woman needs - the doctors, radiologists. It's all under one roof. And hopefully that will simplify before we get a cure.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN: What resonated with you about the story?\n\n\n\n\n\nTripplehorn: Just the way they were telling the story -- the five short films dealing with different women with the diagnoses.\n\n\n\n\n\nI thought it was an interesting way of telling stories. Five directors who are women, for me, personally, it was a great experience to work with each of these directors. Alicia Keys is a first time director. You would never know it when you see her film.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN: Did having family members who've had breast cancer influence you in taking part in this project?\n\n\n\n\n\nTripplehorn: I had two women on my mother's side of the family; both went through bouts of breast cancer. Both survived.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy grandmother was a two-time survivor of breast cancer. She passed away of something different 15 years after her last diagnosis.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's close to my heart and experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN: Having family members who've had this disease, does it make you concerned about your risk?\n\n\n\n\n\nTripplehorn: It's a constant reminder.

{"question": "What makes the vehicles safer?", "answers": ["ultra-high-strength steel and boron"], "context": "(AOL Autos) -- Have you ever heard of someone having their car \"totaled\"? While the word might conjure images of a massive car accident, replete with broken glass and the Jaws of Life, the reality is sometimes far removed.\n\n\n\nFord's repair and safety engineers first began collaborating on the 2009 F-150 pick-up truck.\n\n\n\nIn fact, there are many accidents that produce structural damage such that the vehicle's frame is bent, even though the exterior of the car might even look drivable.\n\n\n\nTypically these cars are \"totaled,\" which might give buyers the peace of mind knowing they will get a replacement vehicle. But, overall this produces much higher insurance rates for all drivers.\n\n\n\nCar companies and insurers are working hard to try and reduce the cost of auto repairs and insurance premiums for consumers and some of the development is breathtaking in its innovation\n\n\n\nThis effort has already led to many new developments in the design of various auto parts and components -- which have indeed led to a reduction in repair costs for various auto parts, components and structures.\n\n\n\nAnd more advances are on the way: some carmakers have recently ramped up their operations in this area, which should result in greater cost savings in coming years.\n\n\n\nOne recent development in this area is the Ford Motor Company's new $650,000 Paint and Body Technology Center in Inkster, Michigan, about 20 minutes from the company's Dearborn world headquarters. The new center was created by merging operations with the company's Safety Crash Test Analysis department.\n\n\n\nOther car companies have their own versions of this kind of operation, including Ford's crosstown rivals, General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC.\n\n\n\nThe new Ford center represents an advancement over its previous paint and body tech operation in that it's larger, closer to the company's HQ, and now works more closely with design engineers and auto insurers -- and gets insurers involved earlier in the design process. AOL Autos: Cut your insurance in half\n\n\n\nThe goal is to identify potential repair issues and then use that info to refine designs -- which in turn helps cut the cost of repairs at dealerships and independent repair shops. Plus, this effort allows repair techs to more effectively restore the vehicles to their pre-accident condition.\n\n\n\nTo that end, engineers gather data earlier in the vehicle development process so it can be then analyzed during crash and durability testing. AOL Autos: How to choose a repair shop\n\n\n\nFor Ford, the closer integration of these functions began when the carmaker's repair and safety engineers first began collaborating on the 2009 F-150 pick-up truck.\n\n\n\nDuring the vehicle's early development period, these engineers realized that new materials -- including ultra-high-strength steel and boron -- helped make the new truck safer, but also could make it more expensive to repair after a collision. AOL Autos: Minor damages, major repair costs\n\n\n\n\"The extensive use of advanced technologies and materials in the 2009 F-150 required us to develop new, specific procedures and repair recommendations,\" said Gerry Bonanni, Ford's collision repair senior engineer.\n\n\n\nSo, Ford engineers designed and developed new front and rear-frame-section kits -- which means one single section of the frame can now be repaired / replaced after a crash, instead of having to replace the entire frame.\n\n\n\n\"Partial-frame repairs cost at least $2,000 less than full-frame replacements,\" says Bonanni -- and will prevent some vehicles from being \"totaled,\" which would have previously been the case under repair laws in some states.\n\n\n\nThe success of the collaboration on the F-150 prompted the decision to open the new paint and body tech center. A more recent example was the work done on the 2010 Mustang.\n\n\n\n\"Previously, we had no real procedure for sectioning off the rear-frame rails,\" says Bonanni. \"But, by collaborating with repair technicians and the insurance companies, we developed a procedure, which we then documented for the repair techs in our dealers.\n\n\n\n\"That allows them to repair just a short section of the rear-frame rails, instead of replacing the entire frame-rail system", "parametric_answer": "airbags", "parametric_answer_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "The vehicles are made safer by the inclusion of safety features such as airbags, anti-lock braking systems (ABS), electronic stability control (ESC), and crumple zones."}

Watch Larry King on his talk with Woodward »\n\n\n\nJohn Roberts: What do you think of what Woodward is saying?\n\n\n\nMichael Ware: Let's say that these \"fusion teams,\" as they're being called, have come into effect. The first thing to say is, \"Well, about time.\"\n\n\n\nOn the ground you've seen the lack of coordination as the left hand of one agency is not with the right hand of another agency within the American effort. But by and large, to suggest that anything like this being done now has been the major reason for the decline in violence is a bit rich.\n\n\n\nI mean, the U.S. subcontracted out an assassination program against al Qaeda way back in early 2006. And this was conceded by the then-chief of military intelligence in Baghdad and by [U.S.] Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad himself. That's what broke the back of al Qaeda.\n\n\n\nThen when America put 100,000-plus insurgents on the U.S. government payroll, including members of al Qaeda, that not only took them out of the field, but it also let them run their own assassination programs against the Iranian-backed militias.\n\n\n\nRoberts: So it sounds like assassination was a real part of the program here, but was that the only thing that worked? What about the addition of these troops and these neighborhood stations that were set up? Did it all kind of work together?\n\n\n\nWare: It does work together. But the key to the downturn in violence that we're seeing now is not so much the surge of 30,000 troops in itself.\n\n\n\nWhat it's been is the segregation of Baghdad into these enclaves. It's been cutting a deal with Muqtada al-Sadr, the leader of the Iranian-backed militia. And primarily it's been putting your enemy on your payroll -- the Sunni insurgents and many members of al Qaeda. That's what's brought down the violence. This is your American militia, the counterbalance to the Iranian militias.\n\n\n\nSo if there's new teams out there with new technology, great.

There has been no sign of her since August 19, 2007.\n\n\n\nLiza Murphy has been missing from her home in Emerson, New Jersey, since August 19, 2007.\n\n\n\nMurphy's friends and family reported her missing the next day.\n\n\n\n\"In my heart, I fear the worst, that my daughter is gone,\" said her mother, Sophia Stellatos.\n\n\n\nPolice searched extensively for Murphy, especially around a reservoir not far from her home, but they found nothing. Cadaver dogs caught her scent near the George Washington Bridge, but the trail went cold, police told the family.\n\n\n\nDeepening the mystery, her husband, Joe Murphy, tried to take his own life a few days after his wife disappeared by walking into oncoming traffic and throwing himself in front of a fire truck, police say.\n\n\n\nHe was hospitalized and recovered from his injuries, but police say he hired a lawyer and is no longer cooperating with investigators.\n\n\n\nHis lawyer said Murphy, an Irish immigrant, has nothing to hide from the authorities. He said his client has no criminal record and no history of violence. Attorney Joseph Rem added that there was no physical violence in the marriage.\n\n\n\nAccording to her family, Liza Murphy, 42, was not the type of person to take off on her own without letting her family know.  Watch an update »\n\n\n\n\"She would never leave her three children behind voluntarily,\" her mother insisted.\n\n\n\n\"What doesn't make sense is Liza leaving her house without her purse, cell phone, wallet, keys or cigarettes,\" she added. \"She was a heavy smoker, and if she took off after a fight for a walk to cool off, she definitely wouldn't leave without her cigarettes!\"\n\n\n\nLiza Murphy and her husband were having marital problems, her family said. Stellatos described Joe Murphy as possessive of his wife, never allowing her to go out with her friends. She said he was even jealous if she spent time with her parents.\n\n\n\nRem pointed out that his client has not been named as a suspect or a person of interest in the case. He said police have not asked to speak to his client recently.\n\n\n\nLiza Murphy's children are 15, 13 and 10 years old now.

{"question": "what are commentators focused on?", "answers": ["\"bystander effect\":"], "context": "(CNN) -- The alleged gang rape of a 15-year-old girl on the campus of Richmond High School in Northern California while 10 or more witnesses, most of them students, looked on has sparked familiar questions: \"Why are our kids so messed up?\" \"Why didn't these students try to stop the crime?\" \"What's happening in our schools?\"\n\n\n\nThese are fair questions, and commentators in the media have provided familiar answers. The purported rape is another sad example of today's self-absorbed and uncaring youth. It was the media's glorification of violence that caused it. The horrific act shows how sociopathic brains develop. But it seems as if the majority of commentators have settled on the idea that the Richmond students did nothing because of the \"bystander effect\": The more people involved in a criminal incident, the less likely any one of them will intervene to do something about it.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, this \"What's wrong with our children?\" approach leads to a dead end, because it results in a sweeping moral condemnation of the schools, families and students in this community. These perpetrators committed a heinous act that should be widely condemned. But a discussion that focuses exclusively on the immorality of these deviant young men does not provide solutions that prevent gang rape from happening.\n\n\n\nTalking only about the bystander effect wrongly suggests that the vast majority of teens would not call for help. Take Richmond. Claims of depraved acts by a few kids have served to demonize an entire student community.\n\n\n\nRather than demonize all teenagers in Richmond High School, we should be asking another question: \"What can we do to prevent such heinous acts from happening?\"\n\n\n\nThe answer to that question leads to a wholly different kind of dialogue, one that may surprise. It is primarily students, the reputed problem, who can best prevent acts of violence on campus.\n\n\n\nMake no mistake about it. The alleged two-hour-long gang rape on October 24 was an extreme form of school violence. It unfolded not far from the gym where the school-sponsored homecoming dance, supervised by school staff and police officers, was being held. And students, police say, largely perpetrated it.\n\n\n\nResearch since the massacres at Columbine High School (1999) and Virginia Tech (2007) has taught us a lot about how to prevent such school violence. Chief among them is that school staff and security should patrol campuses, especially violence-prone areas, during and after school events.\n\n\n\nAccording to a CNN report, a friend of the alleged victim saw blatant failures in safety precautions. She said, \"I looked outside of the gym, and I saw 12 to 15 guys, sitting there, with no IDs. The officers -- not only did they not check the IDs of those students or men sitting outside of of our campus, but the security officers who are employed here did no job of checking either.\"\n\n\n\nVirtually all students and teachers at a school can identify these dangerous hot spots. At Richmond High School, one such spot is \"a dark alley near the back side of the school,\" the site of the purported rape.\n\n\n\nAs CNN reported, school officials had even requested that video cameras and more lights be installed in the area, but they were never installed. The alleged rapists and student bystanders probably knew that no one would be patrolling the area.\n\n\n\nAs important as campus patrols are in reducing campus violence, the most powerful form of prevention is believing that students can help stop crime from happening. They didn't stop the purported rape at Richmond, a skeptic might say. A possible reason is that they were not educated on how to stop it. .\n\n\n\nResearch shows us that students often know ahead of time when and where violence will flare up on campus.

{"question": "What continent is the Pope visiting?", "answers": ["Africa."], "context": "(CNN) -- An estimated 1 million people turned out to hear Pope Benedict XVI preach a Mass in Angola on Sunday, the last major event of his first trip to Africa.\n\n\n\nPope Benedict XVI celebrates Mass in Angola, where he told Angolans on Sunday to \"trust in God's promises.\"\n\n\n\nHe spoke of the need for reconciliation in a country that endured a brutal civil war lasting nearly three decades.\n\n\n\n\"Look to the future with hope, trust in God's promises and live in his truth. In this way you will build something that will stand and endure ... a lasting heritage of reconciliation, justice and peace,\" Benedict said in English to polite applause.\n\n\n\nThe service's Bible reading's \"vivid description of the destruction wrought by war echoes the personal experiences of so many people in this country amid the terrible ravages of the civil war,\" Benedict said in the Mass, which was broadcast by TPA, a CNN affiliate in Angola.\n\n\n\n\"How true it is that war can destroy everything of value: families, whole communities, the fruit of men's labor.\"\n\n\n\nBenedict also expressed \"deep sorrow\" at the death of two women killed in a stampede at one of his events in Angola on Saturday, papal spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said.\n\n\n\nCardinal Tarciso Bertone, the Vatican secretary of state, earlier led a Vatican delegation to the hospitals where the bodies of two dead women are being kept, Lombardi said. They prayed over the dead bodies and met with the family of the one victim who has been identified, a catechism teacher in a parish in Luanda whose last class was Saturday morning.\n\n\n\nMidway through the Mass, a long line of worshippers brought offerings to the pontiff, as an electric organ and guitar played a joyous tune over the sound of percussion instruments and a choir, members of which were wearing matching white baseball caps. Women carried local produce on their heads in wide baskets or tall jugs, many dancing to the music as they waited to meet the pope.\n\n\n\nThe 81-year-old pontiff mopped his face with a white handkerchief several times during the outdoor service, while many worshippers sought shelter from the sun under umbrellas.\n\n\n\nThe pope spoke in English and Portuguese, the language of Angola's former colonial rulers, during the hour-long service, while local clergy read short passages in tribal languages.\n\n\n\nBenedict has been in Africa since Tuesday. He returns to Rome on Monday.\n\n\n\nAfrica is the last continent that Benedict had left to visit, and one he could not avoid, said David Gibson, a biographer of the pope.\n\n\n\n\"He knows he has to do this. He knows Africa is the future of the [Roman Catholic] Church, as it is for all of Christianity,\" said Gibson. Christianity, like Islam, is on the rise in Africa and Latin America, even as the northern hemisphere tends to become more secular.\n\n\n\nOne in five of the world's Christians lives in Africa -- up from fewer than one in 50 in 1900, said Brian Grim, an editor of the World Religion Database.\n\n\n\nSo Benedict is making the visit, although travel \"is not his cup of tea,\" Gibson said, in contrast to his predecessor. \"John Paul II loved the travel and loved the different cultures. Benedict is a European through and through.\"\n\n\n\nBut Benedict understands that travel has become an essential part of a pope's duties, said Gibson, the author of \"The Rule of Benedict: Pope Benedict XVI and His Battle with the Modern World.\"\n\n\n\nThe trip opened with controversy, with the pope reiterating the Vatican's opposition to artificial birth control Tuesday while flying to Cameroon, the first stop on his journey.\n\n\n\nSub-Saharan Africa has been hit harder by AIDS and HIV than any other region of the world, according to the United Nations and World Health Organization.

But smart cabin lighting may actually help your body adjust to a new time zone -- and beat back jet lag. Virgin America has an in-cabin lighting system that subtly shifts through 12 shades of violet, including a welcoming, bright blue-purple during the day, a softer violet hue after dusk, and a deep, calming near-black on red-eyes when it's time to sleep.

{"question": "Who was the documentary about?", "answers": ["Silvio Berlusconi."], "context": "(CNN)  -- She's been called Italy's answer to Michael Moore, and she doesn't pull any punches -- even when the subject she's taking to task is Italian leader Silvio Berlusconi.\n\n\n\n\n\nFilmmaker Sabina Guzzanti puts the prime minister's handling of the L'Aquila earthquake, which killed nearly 300 people and devastated the city when it struck last year, under deep scrutiny in her latest documentary \"Draquila -- Italy Trembles.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently screened at Cannes Film Festival, the documentary is creating a stir among critics and the Italian government alike.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though he has been dogged by allegations of corruption and fraud --  which he strongly denies -- as well as criticism of his personal lifestyle, many Italians still support Berlusconi.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are so many scandals in Italy, the picture can get quite complicated, Guzzanti told CNN. At home, she is a well-known political satirist and critic of the government.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe decided to focus on one disaster, L'Aquila, to show how abuse of power, corruption and misinformation have contributed to what she presents as the precarious state of democracy in Italy today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The idea was this: Explain Italy through L'Aquila,\" she told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Italian government has responded angrily to the film, whose title is a combination of the words \"Dracula\" and \"L'Aquila.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCulture Minister Sandro Bondi refused to attend Cannes, where the film was shown as part of the festival's special screening program.\n\n\n\n\n\nBondi issued a statement, dismissing the documentary as \"propaganda\" and saying it \"offends the truth and all of the Italian people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGuzzanti is used to incurring the government's displeasure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Raiot,\" a political satire TV show she wrote, directed and acted in, was cancelled after just one episode on a state-owned television network following a defamation suit filed by Silvio Berlusconi's Mediaset TV network.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a retort, she made \"Viva Zapatero,\" a 2005 film that examines censorship.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what is it about \"Draquila,\" Guzzanti's fourth feature, that has created an uproar among Berlusconi supporters?\n\n\n\n\n\nGuzzanti argues that Berlusconi, whose ratings were suffering when the earthquake hit in April last year, took advantage of the tragic event to improve his image and boost the public's opinion of him.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe documentary uses straightforward language to paint a stark picture of what the filmmaker sees as Berlusconi's exploitation of the tragic event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Opinion polls showed his popularity was plummeting. So, when, at 0332 on April 6, 2009, an earthquake awoke even those in the Big Brother house, and when it emerged an entire town was destroyed, for Berlusconi it was like God reaching out to him again,\" a voiceover says in the film.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch a clip of the film\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the wake of the quake, Berlusconi made a last-minute decision to move the G8 Summit to L'Aquila from Sardinia -- a gesture that attracted world attention -- and took advantage of photo opportunities in several trips to the leveled city.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven more damning, though, is the documentary's examination of the reconstruction efforts in L'Aquila. In particular, the film takes issue with the role played by the Civil Protection Authority.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe film argues that the government agency has amassed such immense power under Berlusconi that it can dodge the law -- when granting reconstruction contracts, for instance -- all in the name of emergency and safety.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Guzzanti, investigating the aftermath of the earthquake and the power of the Civil Protection Authority is a way of examining Italy's drift into authoritarianism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They became like a private army of the prime minister with licence of spending money and making laws,\" she said of the agency. \"And I was shocked and started to investigate.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHer film has won praise, not only for its high degree of scrutiny, but for its even-handedness as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter described \"Draquila\" as a \"straightforward and surprisingly balanced documentary.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile her probing style and knack for ruffling feathers make it easy to draw comparisons with Michael Moore, Guzzanti distinguishes herself with an", "parametric_answer": "steve jobs", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm happy to help!

John Whitmire, a Houston Democrat and the chair of the state senate's Criminal Justice Committee, became an ally of Moriarty's after one phone call in October.\n\n\n\nHe picked up a phone slip from his secretary and called the number on it -- only to realize he had returned a call to a death row inmate's cell phone.\n\n\n\nThe inmate, he said, was Richard Tabler -- a convicted double murderer who was sharing a wireless phone with nine other inmates.\n\n\n\n\"At first I thought it was a hoax,\" said Whitmire, who said he called the state justice board and \"read them the riot act.\"\n\n\n\nWhitmire is one of the sponsors of a bill in the Texas Legislature that would crack down on convicts caught with phones and allow prison systems to monitor and detect cell signals.

{"question": "What has ticked off a number of leaders?", "answers": ["nomination of Elena Kagan to fill the seat of retiring Supreme Court Justice John Paul"], "context": "(CNN) -- The nomination of Elena Kagan to fill the seat of retiring Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens has caused quite a stir on the political left and right, as operatives on both sides try to ascertain exactly where she stands.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it has also opened another fissure in the complex relationship that exists between black organizational leaders and President Obama, the nation's first African-American president.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past year we have seen criticisms leveled by grass-roots activists, civil rights groups and the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut instead of taking on the president, the beefs are largely aimed at \"those around the president.\" In previous administrations, these same individuals wouldn't have hesitated to call out Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush or Ronald Reagan.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy the hesitance? Because they also understand that a direct attack on President Obama could hurt them in two ways: They could find themselves cut off from the administration or they could anger their base by making the president's job more difficult when he is facing daily attacks from Republicans.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven among African-American commentators, columnists and radio and TV show hosts, if you are too harsh on President Obama, the backlash has been swift and vicious.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe organizations know this, and trust me, the White House knows this, and has used it to its advantage.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's why I call it the Obama-Black-Two-Step.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been told countless times by folks on both sides that Obama can't be seen as favoring African-Americans over others, and his White House has been especially scared of touching anything dealing with race.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, black civil rights leaders and prominent Democrats have largely bitten their tongues, unwilling to publicly take on the president and some of his decisions. Instead, they quietly fume, mumbling under their breath and offering their critiques in measured tones.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet I have gotten the sense that black civil rights and political leaders may stop the racial solidarity and stand up on the principles they have long fought for. I've been expressly told that some have no interest in working hard or raising money in the fall on behalf of Democrats to hold on to the House and Senate.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nomination of Kagan has become a flash point in this uneasy relationship, because this is the second time in a year that President Obama has made a Supreme Court appointment and his administration didn't seriously consider an African-American woman for the job.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nomination of Sonia Sotomayor certainly was historic in that she became the first Hispanic to sit on the high court, and it was embraced by civil rights groups. Yet this time, for highly qualified African-American female judges, such as Leah Ward Sears, the retired chief justice of the Georgia Supreme Court, to never make the cut for a face-to-face interview with the president has ticked off a number of leaders I've talked with over the last several days.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the big deal about including a black woman? A Democratic pollster told me that black women have a higher voter turnout than any other ethnic-gender demographic -- 65 percent -- and it's vital for Obama to appeal to them. When Obama was behind Sen. Hillary Clinton in the polls, it was because black women hadn't embraced him yet. When they did, the race changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe uneasiness with Kagan's appointment among civil rights groups has focused on the hiring record of minorities during her tenure at Harvard Law School, which was followed by the White House pushing back to insulate her from criticism by saying the Harvard faculty makes the recommendations about hiring for tenured positions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were quick to blast out blogs, columns and articles written by African-Americans at Harvard to make clear Kagan is a major advocate of diversity.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a meeting with civil rights leaders and administration officials was held at the White House on Tuesday with senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, I was told \"more listening than talking\" was done by the administration.\n\n\n\n\n\nCivil rights leaders made clear that they felt they were being taken for granted in the process, and were", "parametric_answer": "coronavirus", "parametric_answer_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm going to take a guess and say: \"Countries\"!

What do you think that means?\n\n\n\n\n\nFareed Zakaria: That's a major development because so far we have not really been able to assess whether Iran has decided definitively that it wants nuclear weapons. We know that it wants a nuclear capacity -- that is clear -- and it wants a large nuclear capacity and one that is robust so that they have multiple production sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it has always seemed as though there were two views within the Iranian leadership. One was that Iran should develop a robust civilian nuclear capability and a robust missile program but that it should not put the two together because that would place it in clear violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. There are clearly others in Iran who believe that Iran should simply have nuclear weapons. ...\n\n\n\n\n\nThis would suggest that the harder line faction within Iran is winning out.

I also think the sanctions that are being talked about are fairly narrow and targeted at particularly the Republican Guard within the regime, which seems to be most powerful faction. And that's the right approach to take. We know that generalized sanctions only hurt the average Iranian, and that is entirely counterproductive.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN: What's the impact of the domestic turbulence inside Iran, including the protest movement?\n\n\n\n\n\nZakaria: Nobody knows for sure, but it does seem to have confused the situation internally. [Iranian President Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad had made some conciliatory statements on the nuclear issue, which were then attacked by the opposition, and he retracted it, which suggests that he's feeling the pressure.

{"question": "What was misspelled when received the tickets?", "answers": ["his wife's name,"], "context": "(Tribune Media Services) -- Frank Santa Maria buys two tickets to Italy on Expedia. But when an agent misspells his wife's name, he must embark on an odyssey to ensure she'll be allowed to use her tickets. Will he be successful?\n\n\n\nQ: I recently bought tickets to Italy by calling Expedia. I spelled my wife's first name to the agent. That afternoon we left town for a trip. When we returned the tickets were at the front door and a confirmation e-mail was waiting. My wife's first name was spelled Crista instead of Christa.\n\n\n\nI immediately called Expedia, and was told I should have contacted them the day the e-mail was sent to me and that there would be a $150 re-ticketing fee. After several more calls and being put on \"hold\" for more than half an hour, a supervisor told me that there was nothing they could do. They couldn't even change the name on the ticket.\n\n\n\nI contacted the airline directly and they told me they would make a note on my wife's passenger record. My wife's tickets are still wrong and I'm afraid we may have a problem with our connecting airline or with customs. What can I do?\n\n\n\n-- Frank Santa Maria, New Braunfels, Texas\n\n\n\nA: Expedia should have spelled your wife's name correctly. When it was clear that the company had made an error, it should have done everything in its power to fix it instead of giving you the runaround and forcing you to deal directly with your airline.\n\n\n\nThen again, it should have never come to this. First, why are you phoning an online travel agency to buy tickets? It may be more convenient, but online agencies are built to handle your purchases online. It's more efficient and reduces the chance of an error being introduced -- like misspelling a passenger's name.\n\n\n\nSecond, you should always check your verification e-mail immediately. Expedia could have made a change to your ticket if you had caught the mistake earlier. It's essential that you review your itinerary as soon as possible. Believe me, I know. I just made this mistake and had to spend an extra day at my destination because I put the wrong date in my reservation. (See? It can happen to anyone.)\n\n\n\nI've dealt with too many wrong-name cases to count, and here are a few things I've learned. Passengers aren't turned away at the gate because of a typographical error on their tickets. Reservations systems have limitations that sometimes truncate last names or render non-English names in funny characters. Last names and first names are frequently flip-flopped. Ticket agents, gate agents and security screeners know that, and will let you through.\n\n\n\nI haven't heard of anyone being denied boarding because of a one-character difference in a name. I'm reasonably sure your wife would have been allowed to travel using her ticket, even if this had happened after the May 15 implementation of the first phase of the Transportation Security Administration's \"Secure Flight\" initiative, which requires that you provide your full name as it appears on your government-issued identification.\n\n\n\nIncidentally, the \"notation\" in her reservation would have almost certainly been visible to any connecting airline. And a customs agent wouldn't even pay attention to your ticket under normal circumstances. It's your customs form and passport that matter to them.\n\n\n\nNext time you buy tickets by phone -- and I hope there's no next time -- do yourself a big favor: When you offer your name to the agent, ask to have it spelled back. That way, you'll catch any errors before the transaction goes through. Once you have a reservation, it becomes much more difficult (or even impossible) to make a change.\n\n\n\nIt shouldn't be that way. In an ideal world, you'd be able to change a name on a ticket. Airlines say they can't allow name changes for \"security reasons\" but I'm inclined to believe it has more to do with the fact that they", "parametric_answer": "name", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm happy to help!"}
{"question": "Who discovered the tape?", "answers": ["Darrin Tuck,"], "context": "(CNN) -- Jury selection was under way Thursday in the case of a man accused of sexually assaulting a toddler and capturing it on videotape years ago, a crime that triggered a nationwide manhunt and search for the girl when the tape surfaced in 2007.\n\n\n\nChester Arthur Stiles faces life imprisonment if convicted of videtaping a sexual assault on a child.\n\n\n\nChester Arthur Stiles, 38, faces 22 felony counts in connection with the videotape, including lewdness with a child, sexual assault with a minor and attempted sexual assault with a minor. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.\n\n\n\nThursday is the third day of jury selection, said Michael Sommermeyer, spokesman for Clark County, Nevada, courts.\n\n\n\nSome 200 potential jurors were called, according to CNN affiliate KVBC. As of Thursday morning, only seven jurors had passed on to the next stage of selection, Sommermeyer said.\n\n\n\nProsecutors hope to seat 15 jurors eventually, Sommermeyer told CNN, meaning they'll want a pool of about 35 to pick from in the final stage.\n\n\n\nPicking a jury in the case is challenging, according to KVBC, not only because of the media attention the case has drawn, but because of the crimes Stiles is accused of. A questionnaire given to potential jurors has one question addressing the videotape: \"As a juror, despite the graphic nature of the videotape, can you promise to remain fair and impartial and objectively evaluate all evidence for returning a verdict?\"\n\n\n\n\"One, you let them know what the case involves and they've heard it on the news, it's a little difficult to get over any preconceived notions that they had about the case,\" defense attorney Stacey Roundtree told KVBC.\n\n\n\n\"However, we do have faith in this community that they want to do the right thing,\" she said. \"Most of the jury trials I've had, the jurors go out of their way to make the right decision. They go out of their way to follow the judge's rules, and we're confident we can have that happen in this case.\"\n\n\n\nThe tape was given to authorities in September 2007 by a man who said he had found it in the desert five months before. On it, police found images of the small girl being sexually assaulted.\n\n\n\nAfter attempting unsuccessfully to find out the girl's identity, authorities turned to the media for help and released a picture of the girl, and the case drew nationwide attention. She was found in October 2007.\n\n\n\nAn attorney for the child's mother said she is 7 years old and safe and healthy.

{"question": "In what year was the president murder?", "answers": ["1981,"], "context": "(CNN) -- October 6, 1981, remains etched in the minds of Egyptians who witnessed the assassination of President Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat at the hands of four military officers during an annual parade celebrating the anniversary of Egypt's 1973 war with Israel.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1979, Sadat signed the Camp David peace treaty with Israel that won him the Nobel Peace Prize and the fury of many Arabs who accused him of betraying their cause.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a tribute to the former \"hero of war and peace,\" as the inscription on his grave reads, Egyptian State TV ran footage Thursday of the assassination, depicting the moment Sadat stood in the pavilion saluting his killers while they fired at him as French Mirage fighters screeched over the parade grounds as part of the festivities.\n\n\n\n\n\nKhaled El Islambouly, the lead gunman, was captured and executed.\n\n\n\n\n\nSadat's bullet-riddled body was rushed to the Maadi Military Hospital and the president was proclaimed dead at 2.40 p.m. due to \"intense nervous shock and internal bleeding in the chest cavity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTalaat El Sadat, a former member of parliament and the nephew of the slain president, recalls the details of that grim day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The president thought the killers were part of the show when they approached the stands firing, so he stood saluting them,\" El Sadat told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nEl Sadat claims his uncle refused to wear bulletproof vests and always confidently argued, \"I am among my sons.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAn investigation uncovered evidence that the killers had plotted the attack with Al Gamaa al-Islamiyya, a Muslim Brotherhood offshoot that had failed ambitions of launching an Islamic revolution in the mid-1980s.\n\n\n\n\n\nAboud El Zomor, the leader of Al Gamaa al-Islamiyya, was convicted of plotting the assassination and spent almost 30 years behind bars before his release in April, among hundreds of political prisoners detained during President Hosni Mubarak's regime.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree decades later, in his first interview with a U.S. television news organization since his release, El Zomor was unapologetic about being a part of the killing of Sadat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our role was related to assisting but not decision-making,\" El Zomor recalled in his interview with CNN. \"All that we did, our role, is that we had ammunition that we sent\" to the assassins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The idea was just to change and provide an alternative leader who could save Egypt from a crisis of the political dead-end we lived in then,\" El Zomor explained. \"I intended complete change, not just the murder of Sadat.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe cheered the January 25 revolution that ousted Mubarak on February 11 and felt \"jealous\" that his own religious revolution did not succeed. He also claimed that Al Gamaa al-Islamiyya has renounced its military arm because there was \"no need to fight the oppression of the former Mubarak regime.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fall of regimes almost always comes with the unveiling of secret documents and conspiracy theories.\n\n\n\n\n\nSadat's assassination was recently revisited by his daughter, Roqaya al-Sadat, a month after Mubarak was toppled. She filed a case in March at the general prosecutor's office claiming new evidence had emerged implicating Mubarak, who was Sadat's vice president.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The lead gunman's machine gun jammed and he reached in the vehicle for another gun,\" said Talaat El Sadat. He demands an explanation to how guns without their safety pins were smuggled in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Where was my uncle's elite security all this time?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The answer (to all of this) is Hosni Mubarak. He benefits the most from the killing, assisted by the Americans and the Israelis,\" El Sadat said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the peace with Israel that Sadat worked relentlessly to achieve may be at the brink of collapse.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-Israeli sentiment in Egypt in the past few months has been its most violent since the times of Sadat, as highlighted by the pro-democracy protesters who breached the Israeli Embassy on September 9.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same protesters who brought down the Mubarak regime insist on ending the exports of gas to Israel and many call for the cancellation of the Camp David Peace Treaty after an", "parametric_answer": "1963", "parametric_answer_freq": 5, "parametric_evidencde": "I cannot provide information or speculate about the murder of a president."}

{"question": "What is the name of the defendant?", "answers": ["Casey Anthony,"], "context": "(CNN) -- Now that Caylee Anthony's remains have been identified, the search for the Florida toddler turns into a prosecution of her mother.\n\n\n\nCasey Anthony, 22, is accused of killing her daughter. Investigators say her alibi didn't check out.\n\n\n\nAlthough Orange County, Florida, Medical Examiner Jan Garavaglia said Friday she could not determine how Caylee died, she concluded the death was a homicide.\n\n\n\nThe child's mother, Casey Anthony, 22, faces charges including murder in the disappearance and death of Caylee, who was 2 when she vanished last summer.\n\n\n\nThe remains were found last week in woods about a half-mile from Anthony's parents' house and identified through DNA testing.  See where Caylee's skeleton was found »\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, investigators finished 10 days of sifting through the crime scene and served a warrant at the Anthony house for a third search for evidence, said Capt. Angelo Nieves of the Orange County sheriff's department. Cindy and George Anthony, the child's grandparents, were present for the search.\n\n\n\nThe mother's defense team had claimed since her October indictment that the child might still be alive, even claiming witnesses spotted Caylee since her disappearance.\n\n\n\nThe finding of the body \"has really cut the legs out of the defense,\" Stacey Honowitz, an assistant Florida state's attorney, said Friday night on CNN's \"Larry King Live.\"  Watch experts size up the legal case »\n\n\n\nThe lack of a cause of death and the absence of any soft tissue on the toddler's skeletal remains poses a challenge for prosecutors, forensic expert Lawrence Kobilinsky, a defense consultant for Casey Anthony, told Larry King.\n\n\n\n\"If you don't have a cause of death, isn't it possible that it might have been an accident?\" Kobilinsky said.\n\n\n\nA murder conviction would require proof the victim was killed intentionally. Legal experts say duct tape reportedly found on the body could convince a judge or jury that Caylee's death was not an accident.\n\n\n\nPerhaps of greater significance, though, is Casey Anthony's behavior since -- and even before -- her child went missing.\n\n\n\nAccording to earlier reports, Caylee was the result of an unintended pregnancy, and Anthony made an attempt to give her up after birth. She referred to Caylee as \"the little snot head\" and continued to maintain an active social life.  Follow a timeline of the case »\n\n\n\nWhen Caylee went missing, Anthony did not tell her family for a month. It was the child's grandmother who called police. Anthony told conflicting stories at the beginning of the investigation, including a tale that Caylee was with a nanny. The name and address turned out to be bogus. As police searched for Caylee, they say Anthony's active social life continued -- including one memorable evening dancing at an Orlando bar that was hosting \"Hot Body Contest.\"   Investigators said they found the scent of decomposing flesh and a trace of chloroform, a powerful knockout agent, in the trunk of a car Anthony drove at the time. Anthony's family offered various explanations, including a rotting pizza and a dead squirrel.  Watch a tribute to the little girl »\n\n\n\nOn the Anthonys' home computer, police found there had been searches for chloroform, missing children and \"neck-breaking,\" although Garavaglia said Friday that she did not find evidence of trauma to the bones.\n\n\n\n\"The prosecution is going to have a great deal of circumstantial evidence, and this is a physical evidence case,\" Kobilinsky said. \"This is not a question about credibility, although obviously a jury looks at credibility and contradictions, but the physical evidence will either include her or exclude Casey. It's an uphill battle for the defense.\"\n\n\n\nNevertheless, forensic expert Kathy Reichs, who also is working with Anthony's defense team, sees an opening.\n\n\n\n\"Given that there's no evidence as to the cause of death, ... you could have an accidental death and a mother that panics,\" she told King. \"There are alternative explanations.\"\n\n\n\nPerhaps not enough to save Anthony, said famed", "parametric_answer": "john", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "\"I'm not aware of a question being asked yet!

Or which Milanese visionary has a new fabric technique discovered during a life-changing trip to Angkor Wat that's sure to bring back sixties minimalism with a twist. Or that so-and-so has signed a deal to develop boutique spa hotels around the globe in former monasteries. Because, in the end, he's Ralph Lauren, and we're not.\n\nRalph Lauren has his eye on China and Japan.\n\nFor four decades no other designer has had a greater impact, not only on the way American men and women dress but also on the way they imagine, seek and indulge in the Good Life, than the former tie salesman from the Bronx.\n\n\"Those ties were handmade, by the way,\" recalls Lauren. \"Back then, ties, even designer ones, didn't sell for more than $5 apiece. Mine were $12 to $15. Such luxury in something so simple was revolutionary.\"\n\nAnd ironic. Because while no other designer logo exemplifies aspiration in the home of the free and the brave like the mallet-wielding guy on the pony, Lauren originally named his company Polo because \"it was the sport of kings. It was glamorous, sexy and international.\"  See his designs »\n\nIn the beginning a few people questioned if it was named after Marco Polo -- but today the fact that virtually none of Lauren's millions of devoted customers has ever even seen a polo match is immaterial. Lauren instinctively caught something that was in the air before any of his competitors had a chance to grab it -- the desire, not just to be a success but to look like one before you'd even achieved your goal.\n\nWhat's more, Lauren made it look as easy as Fred Astaire dancing down a staircase.\n\n\"What matters the most to me are clothes that are consistent and accessible,\" says the designer.\n\n\"When I look at the people I've admired over the years, the ultimate stars, like Frank Sinatra, Cary Grant and Astaire, the ones who last the longest are the ones whose style has a consistency, whose naturalness is part of their excitement. And when you think of the blur of all the brands that are out there, the ones you believe in and the ones you remember, like Chanel and Armani, are the ones that stand for something. Fashion is about establishing an image that consumers can adapt to their own individuality. And it's an image that can change, that can evolve. It doesn't reinvent itself every two years.\"\n\nHowever, with a media that is insatiable for the new, the now and the next, being steadfast doesn't always make for good copy.\n\n\"The spotlight is always going to search for the newcomer,\" Lauren admits. \"And that's fine. But the key to longevity is to keep doing what you do better than anyone else. We work real hard at that. It's about getting your message out to the consumer. It's about getting their trust, but also getting them excited, again and again. My clothes -- the clothes we make for the runway -- aren't concepts. They go into stores. Our stores. Thankfully, we have lots of them,\" says Lauren.\n\n\"What I rely on is people walking into my store saying, 'I want your clothes.'\"\n\nWell, if all of Lauren's customers shouted that together, he would go deaf faster than he could pull on one of his classic pullovers.\n\nLauren's effortless luxury is all over the red carpet, on ski slopes and boats, at Wimbledon and elsewhere. It furnishes living rooms and graces dinner tables. It's on the bed, in the bed and under the bed -- and now sits on coffee tables, thanks to the tome Ralph Lauren (Rizzoli), celebrating his 40-years-and-growing career.\n\nBut far from giving his customary over-the-", "parametric_answer": "fabric", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "What a great question!\n\nWhile beauty is subjective, I'd argue that several factors can make clothing glamorous:\n\n1. **Fabric and texture**: Luxurious fabrics like silk, velvet, and lace can add an air of sophistication and glamour to an outfit.\n2. **Cut and silhouette**: A well-tailored garment that"}

{"question": "Who cared about Somalia?", "answers": ["William Jelani Cobb"], "context": "Editor's note: William Jelani Cobb is Associate Professor of History at Spelman College, and author of the forthcoming \"Change Has Come: Barack Obama and the Meaning of Progress.\" He blogs at http://americanexception.com/\n\n\n\nWilliam Jelani Cobb says Somalia's piracy problem was fueled by environmental and political events.\n\n\n\n(CNN) -- The drama of an American ship captain held hostage by Somali pirates led last Sunday's talk shows.\n\n\n\nJust hours before Maersk Alabama Capt. Richard Phillips was rescued, the piracy incident was discussed as one of the \"tests\" of President Obama that Joe Biden warned about during the campaign.\n\n\n\nOthers wondered whether wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have stretched our military resources too thin to respond effectively to these kinds of provocations. Many expressed outrage at the brand of naval gangsterism that by some estimates generated as much as $80 million in 2008.\n\n\n\nClearly this escalating pattern of pirate attacks may soon constitute an international crisis. But what this situation actually reveals is how little we've learned in the nearly eight years since George W. Bush declared war on terror.\n\n\n\nSomalia is like Afghanistan in that we had a great deal of interest in the place during the Cold War and more or less forgot about it afterward. The United States supported the government of Said Barre during the 1980s primarily for the same reason we began funneling aid to the Afghan rebels: anticommunism.\n\n\n\nBarre was a regional counterpoint to the Marxist regime next door in Ethiopia and strategically important enough for his human rights abuses to be tolerated. And like Afghanistan, Somalia quickly fell into disarray after the Cold War ended and the United States cut off support.\n\n\n\nDuring the early post-Cold War era, the United States developed a more narrowly defined set of interests and it was common to hear American foreign policy circles express disdain for \"nation-building\" projects. But two decades later we continue to deal with the consequences of our abrupt exit from both countries.\n\n\n\nOur fleeting humanitarian concern with Somalia ended with the downing of two Blackhawk helicopters in 1993. But that incident actually served as a kind of foreshadowing and highlighted yet another link to Afghanistan: The forces that attacked American troops in Mogadishu were reportedly linked to al Qaeda.\n\n\n\nThe 9/11 attacks and Afghanistan's role in sheltering al Qaeda should have given us reason to re-examine other regions where similar blowback might take place. In short, we might well have looked at what was going on in Afghanistan after September 11, 2001, and seen trouble on the horizon elsewhere.\n\n\n\nThe Somali situation was further complicated by a series of economic and ecological problems that have struck the region in the past decade. In the wake of the government collapse, the Somali coast became a target of illegal commercial fishing. This is a problem across East and Southern Africa but rampant in Somalia. According to one report, some 700 vessels were illegally operating in the region and fishing the local stock to near depletion.\n\n\n\nAs recently as 2006 Somali fishermen complained to the U.N. that illegal fishing was driving them to the brink of economic collapse. To add to the burden, the coast also became a favorite locale for nuclear waste dumping.\n\n\n\nIn 2005, U.N. officials confirmed that barrels containing illegally dumped nuclear waste had cracked open during the tsunami that year and begun washing ashore. The situation was widely reported by international news outlets with virtually no consequences.\n\n\n\nNo matter what we think of their current methods, it's impossible to solve the piracy problem without addressing the illegal fishing issue. Somalia lacks a functioning navy -- or government. Similarly, we were not talking about the over-fishing and nuclear waste issues -- to the extent we do talk about them now -- before the Somalis began to respond in kind.\n\n\n\nThese environmental violations will undoubtedly cost lives and the West has more or less ignored Somali pleas. Our intense and highly selective outrage began when the Somalis started targeting commercial vehicles.\n\n\n\nFaced with this response it's hard to avoid the conclusion that the Western consumer products, carried by these ships are more valuable than Somali lives.\n\n\n\nGiven the recent history of unstable states like Afghanistan and Iraq, piracy is actually one of the milder", "parametric_answer": "usa", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "The United Nations and the international community as a whole cared about Somalia."}
{"question": "in what year its revolution?", "answers": ["1979"], "context": "(CNN) -- Iran could see widespread protests this weekend, as a day of mourning for the most prominent cleric to oppose the regime coincides with the major Shiite holy day of Ashura.\n\n\n\n\n\nIran -- whose regime exists as an explicitly Shiite Muslim leadership -- may find it politically and culturally difficult to put a lid on the marking of Ashura this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt falls on Sunday -- which happens to be a week to the day since the death of Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, a key figure in the 1979 Iranian revolution. Montazeri, who went on to become one of the government's most vocal critics, died December 20.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe seventh day after a death is a traditional time for mourning in Islam, giving Iran's opposition two reasons to demonstrate on Sunday, both with impeccable religious justification.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what exactly is Ashura and why does it draw such passionate crowds, some of whom beat themselves until they bleed?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe holy day commemorates the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, who died in 680 fighting to lead the religion based on the teachings of his grandfather, the Prophet Mohammed. The battle is one of the defining points in the split between the two main branches of Islam, the majority Sunnis and the minority Shiites.\n\n\n\n\n\nHussein was badly outnumbered when he was killed fighting Yazeed near the city of Karbala, in modern-day Iraq.\n\n\n\n\n\nShiites commemorate the death of Hussein each year, climaxing on Ashura -- the 10th day of the month of Muharram -- after a 40-day mourning period.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Shiites are a minority among Muslims worldwide, they are the majority in Iraq and Iran, where the day sees tens or even hundreds of thousands of faithful out on the streets.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the most dramatic scenes take place in Karbala itself, as Shiites congregate to do symbolic penance for failing to come to Hussein's aid in his uprising against Yazeed.\n\n\n\n\n\nBelievers chant, beat their breasts, cut themselves with daggers or swords and whip themselves in synchronized moves.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Iraq under Saddam Hussein, the marking of Ashura was banned for 30 years.

But it takes place in an unlikely spot: a 2,700-acre sanctuary in rural Tennessee.\n\n\n\nIt's not where nature intended the animals to be, roaming free in the vast expanses of subtropical Africa and Asia.\n\n\n\nBut for most of them, it's a life far apart from the ones they once lived.\n\n\n\nTarra lived in the back of a truck at a tire store.\n\n\n\nShirley performed at a circus until she broke her leg on a chain. Then, she was moved to the freak show.\n\n\n\nAnd Sissy was treated like a killer. She crushed a handler in her enclosure at a Texas zoo where video shows she'd been beaten into submission with ax handles.\n\n\n\n\"We consider all of these elephants to be rescue elephants, because they are taken out of that environment that is not healthy for them,\" said Carol Buckley, co-founder of the Elephant Sanctuary.\n\n\n\nFounded in 1995 on 112 acres about 30 miles southwest of Nashville, the sanctuary is now the largest natural refuge of its kind in the United States. Twenty-four elephants, most of them sick, old or abused, have lived at the sanctuary; it is currently home to 15 African and Asian elephants.\n\n\n\nIt's a place where elephants can roam freely, largely feed and shelter themselves and interact with others, often after years living alone in captivity.\n\n\n\nBut Buckley and Scott Blais, the nonprofit sanctuary's co-founder, are very clear about what it's not. The sanctuary is not a zoo.\n\n\n\nVisitors aren't allowed onto the property to view the elephants, and only a handful of media members are able to visit each year, in an effort to make the animals' lives as natural as possible.\n\n\n\n\"In order to accommodate the public, you would have to take away from the elephants,\" Buckley said. \"People have their own emotions, that energy,\" Buckley said. \"If you feel fear and they get close, they're going to get hit with your energy.\n\n\n\nFor Buckley, the journey to running the sanctuary -- which operates on private donations and corporate sponsorships -- started with Tarra.\n\n\n\nStudying to be a circus trainer, she bought the elephant, then just a year old, and trained her to perform. But as the years passed and the relationship between animal and trainer strengthened, Buckley came to believe that captivity, particularly in a traveling circus, was no life for an elephant.\n\n\n\n\"I didn't realize that elephants in captivity were suffering and that to train and dominate an elephant was really breaking their spirit,\" she said. \"When you come to love elephants, when you really come to understand them and love them, you want more for them.\n\n\n\n\"And when you learn how elephants live in the wild, it just makes sense that you would want to create a space that resembles that so elephants can just be elephants.\"\n\n\n\nFrom years in the circus and in zoos, Buckley and Tarra made their way to a breeding program at a Canadian wildlife safari, where they met Blais. It was then that the idea for the Elephant Sanctuary was born.\n\n\n\n\"We started talking about elephants in captivity and what we could do and what we should be doing for them, what they truly deserved,\" Blais said.\n\n\n\nAt the preserve, the elephants feed themselves primarily by grazing -- the Asian elephants eat as much as 100 pounds of grass a day -- supplemented with grains and vitamins from the staff. They share space with deer, wild turkey, raccoons, skunks and other native Tennessee animals.\n\n\n\nLife in a circus, and in most zoos", "parametric_answer": "yes", "parametric_answer_freq": 5, "parametric_evidencde": "Yes, the site is open to the public."}

The bill covers the period between 1957 and 1987.\n\n\n\n\"I think it should be our mission to give these families complete answers,\" she said. \"They can't get closure until the remaining CDC studies, which are in progress, are complete.\"\n\n\n\nSen.

The first tournament took place in 1997 with 13 teams, but now annual events take place in Sweden, Iceland, Russia and Brazil which can often feature over 200 teams.  What do you think of Swamp Soccer? Do you prefer Beach Football of another form of the game?

{"question": "who was charged", "answers": ["Brian David Mitchell,"], "context": "(CNN) -- A November 1 trial date has been set for Brian David Mitchell, who is suspected in the 2002 kidnapping of Utah teenager Elizabeth Smart, said a spokeswoman for federal prosecutors.\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. District Judge Dale Kimball set the trial date at a scheduling conference Friday, said Melodie Rydalch, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Utah. Mitchell was not in court that day, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trial is expected to take two weeks, according to the case file. Mitchell's defense attorneys have apparently indicated they will file a motion asking for a change of venue, as the case file said Kimball set a May 26 deadline for the motion and agreed to hear arguments before July 11.\n\n\n\n\n\nMitchell is accused of abducting Smart, then 14, at knifepoint from her bedroom in her family's Salt Lake City, Utah, home in June 2002. Smart was found nine months later, walking down a street in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy with Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Eileen Barzee. Mitchell, a drifter and self-described prophet who called himself \"Emmanuel,\" had done some handyman work at the Smarts' home.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarzee, now 64, pleaded guilty in November to kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor. As part of a plea deal with prosecutors, she agreed to cooperate in the state and federal cases against her husband.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Kimball ruled Mitchell, now 56, is competent to stand trial. State court proceedings against him have been on hold pending the outcome of the federal case.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmart, now 21, testified in October as part of Mitchell's competency hearing that after kidnapping her, Mitchell took her to a wooded area behind her home and performed a mock marriage ceremony with her before sexually assaulting her. She testified that in the nine months of her captivity, no 24-hour period passed without Mitchell raping her.\n\n\n\n\n\nKimball's ruling on Mitchell's competency cannot be appealed until after the case concludes.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarzee had been housed at the Utah State Hospital while courts determined her competency as well as that of her husband. A state court had ruled she could be forcibly medicated, and that ruling led federal prosecutors to file charges against her.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month, Barzee pleaded guilty but mentally ill in state court in the attempted kidnapping of Smart's cousin a month after her kidnapping.

Mike Huckabee on Tuesday said he accepts \"full responsibility\" for granting clemency in 2000 to a man authorities say gunned down four Lakewood, Washington, police officers Sunday.\n\n\n\nMaurice Clemmons, 37, was shot and killed early Tuesday by Seattle police. He was the subject of a two-day manhunt after the four officers were killed at a coffee shop as they met before their shifts began Sunday morning.\n\n\n\nClemmons had a criminal history in Arkansas and Washington. In May 2000, Huckabee commuted his 108-year prison sentence to make him immediately eligible for parole, which was granted by the parole board two months later. Clemmons had been sentenced to 95 years, to run after time he was already serving on previous convictions.\n\n\n\nIn a statement on the conservative news Web site Newsmax.com, Huckabee wrote that he commuted Clemmons' sentence from 108 years to 47 years. Reports that he had pardoned Clemmons or set him free were erroneous, he said.\n\n\n\n\"I take full responsibility for my actions of nine years ago,\" Huckabee said. \"I acted on the facts presented to me in 2000. If I could have possibly known what Clemmons would do nine years later, I obviously would have made a different decision. But if the same file was presented to me today, I would have likely made the same decision.\"\n\n\n\nBut the Arkansas prosecutor who put Clemmons behind bars told CNN on Tuesday that Huckabee was issuing clemency at \"an astounding rate\" during his tenure as governor.\n\n\n\n\"He was exercising the clemency power at what I call a wholesale rate,\" Larry Jegley said. \"He was letting murderers out, he was letting rapists out, and he was letting the likes of Mr. Clemmons out.\"\n\n\n\nOne survey, he said, showed Huckabee issued more clemencies from 1996 to 2004 than the governors of all six surrounding states, including Texas.\n\n\n\nHe said he didn't know why so many clemencies were granted. \"That was part of the frustration that we felt with the entire process. ... We never felt as though he gave victims, their families, jurors, law enforcement and the community in general an adequate explanation as to why he felt compelled to let people of proven danger go in our community.\"\n\n\n\nHuckabee was a Republican presidential candidate in the 2008 election and has not ruled out another White House bid in 2012.

Cole said she has been sober for some time now after two stints in a rehabilitation clinic.\n\n\n\nCole said she underwent chemotherapy in an aggressive way to fight the virus. Within four months of getting chemotherapy, both of Cole's kidneys failed.\n\n\n\n\"I couldn't breathe. I -- I went into -- literally, my kidneys stopped functioning. They stopped, you know, processing the fluid that was starting to build up in my body.\"\n\n\n\nSince then Cole has been on dialysis three days a week and has been searching for a kidney, she told King in one of the first public interviews about the issue.\n\n\n\nCole won six Grammys for her 1991 critically acclaimed album \"Unforgettable: With Love,\" a jazzy tribute to her father. She won a Grammy this year for her new album \"Still Unforgettable\" and another Grammy for her work on another album.\n\n\n\nCole was still able to tour this year even with her kidney ailment. She canceled a planned show last week in South Korea because of her illness, which meant she was in Los Angeles when the organ became available.\n\n\n\n\"I have been on dialysis in Istanbul, Milan, Indonesia, Manila, London. It's -- it's amazing,\" Cole said.\n\n\n\nDuring King's show, dozens of people sent e-mails to CNN telling Cole that they would get tested to see if their kidney could be donated.\n\n\n\nKing handed a thick stack of paper to Cole.\n\n\n\n\"These are all e-mails from dozens -- dozens of people offering to be tested to see if they can match, who want to give you a kidney,\" King said.\n\n\n\nCole stared at the papers for a moment.\n\n\n\n\"There are some great human beings out there.

{"question": "Who should get the vaccine?", "answers": ["girls around 11 or 12."], "context": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- I'm the mother of two daughters, a teen and a tween. So every day, I tiptoe through hormonally laced minefields hoping to avoid emotional carnage in response to any of my random comments or actions.\n\n\n\nThe cervical cancer vaccine, approved in 2006, is recommended for girls around 11 or 12.\n\n\n\nAs I tiptoe, I sometimes stumble, as any mother of girls that age knows. No adult woman in her right mind would knowingly, willingly utter comments that result in young people hissing, hurling verbal grenades such as, \"Thanks, Mom, for calling me fat, AGAIN.\" Or \"Are you EVEN listening to me?\" Or any version of the very popular, \"I hate YOU,\" \"I hate you SO much,\" \"I hate this family,\" or just plain \"AAAARRRRGGGHHHHH!\" followed by stomping feet and slamming doors.\n\n\n\nSo given this background, you might understand why, when I chose to broach the subject of the latest vaccine for young girls, I was braced for a fight. Oddly enough, for once, the battle didn't come.\n\n\n\nI told my teenage daughter I wanted her to get the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine the next time she went to see her doctor.\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, sorry. You have to.\"\n\n\n\n\"I heard it hurts.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, that's too bad. But it might prevent you from getting cancer later in life.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh. (pause) OK.\"\n\n\n\nIf you were keeping score, you might chalk that one up as a Mom win.\n\n\n\nThe only problem with that is after winning over my daughter, I now had to convince myself. This drug has its own emotional battlefields.\n\n\n\nThe HPV vaccine has been available to the public for almost two years. When Merck launched it in 2006 under the name Gardasil, many people enthusiastically embraced it as a wonder drug. Dr. Kevin Ault, associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory University's School of Medicine, says the vaccine helps women avoid an assortment of ailments, some not too serious, but others that are potentially deadly.\n\n\n\n\"There are about 100 different types of human papillomavirus,\" he said. \"Some of them are pretty common and not dangerous, like plantar warts or warts on your hand. About 30 of them infect the genital tract, and about a dozen of them are associated with cancer.\"  Health for Her: Watch more the HPV vaccine and girls »\n\n\n\nIn this case, the cancer Ault is talking about is cervical cancer.\n\n\n\nThe National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2008, there will be over 11,000 new cases of cervical cancer diagnosed and almost 4,000 women will die from it in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that at least 50 percent of people who have had sex will have one type of HPV at some time in their lives.\n\n\n\nGiven those stats, this vaccine would seem like a pretty good thing, right?\n\n\n\nThe hitch is that the vaccine is suggested for adolescent girls, but the viruses in question are sexually transmitted. And that is one of the big reasons the HPV vaccine has divided parents in the question of \"to give or not to give.\"\n\n\n\nLet's face it. Parents don't like thinking about their daughters having sex at all. Ever. Now a new drug comes along, and not only are parents told they should embrace this new vaccine for their young daughters, but it's also part of the set of routine vaccines that doctors are strongly encouraged to give their patients.\n\n\n\nMerck says the drug has been safely tested for girls and women between the ages of 9 and 26. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that girls get the vaccine at age 11 or 12.\n\n\n\nAult explains why youth is key.

{"question": "Who spoke in favor of gay and lesbian rights?", "answers": ["Carisa Cunningham,"], "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama signed an executive order granting some benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees Wednesday, calling it \"a historic step\" but promising more action to come.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama has been criticized by gay rights activists for not doing more since taking office.\n\n\n\n\"We've got more work to do to ensure that government treats all its citizens equally, to fight injustice and intolerance in all its forms and to bring about that more perfect union,\" Obama said.\n\n\n\nThe signing followed sharp criticism of the president over a Justice Department motion filed last week in support of the Defense of Marriage Act -- which effectively bars the federal government from recognizing same-sex unions. Obama said he still wants to repeal the act.\n\n\n\n\"I believe it's discriminatory. I think it interferes with state's rights, and we will work with Congress to overturn it,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe memorandum he signed Wednesday means same-sex partners of civil service employees can be added to the long-term care program, employees can use their sick leave to take care of domestic partners and children and same-sex partners of Foreign Service employees will be included in medical evacuations and housing allocations, according to the White House.\n\n\n\nBut it does not grant full health-care coverage, which would require an act of Congress, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said.\n\n\n\nAs details of the impending memorandum began to filter out Wednesday, the reaction of some gay rights activists was not enthusiastic.\n\n\n\n\"I have to say, as a federal employee, I'm really disappointed,\" Lisa Polyak, 48, of Baltimore, Maryland, said of Obama's expected memorandum.\n\n\n\nPolyak, who has worked for the federal government for more than two decades, is with the Army Medical Department. She was among the two dozen authors of the Dallas Principles, a set of eight statements that seek to guide the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community toward \"full civil equality,\" according to the document's preamble.

Polyak said not having health insurance from the federal government for her partner of 27 years costs her family $4,000 to $5,000 a year, not including co-pays or deductibles.\n\n\n\nAsked in a conference call with reporters whether these benefits were already available to same-sex partners of federal employees, Berry said such benefits are \"subject to the whim of a supervisor.\"\n\n\n\n\"If you have an enlightened supervisor, yes, that is a possibility (that they have been available),\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"What the president is doing today is making this no longer optional. He is making it mandatory.

{"question": "Who says border has never been more protected?", "answers": ["Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer"], "context": "San Diego, California (CNN) -- Don't be surprised if, any day now, you read that the People's Republic of Arizona is in the market for nuclear warheads to put an end, once and for all, to illegal immigration on its southern border. After all, it's the next logical step for the rogue state.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week, to advance the narrative that Arizona has no choice but to do its own immigration enforcement because the federal government is asleep at the switch, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer called for air support. Brewer requested helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles from the White House to patrol the border region with Mexico.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a letter to President Obama, Brewer asked that the National Guard reallocate reconnaissance helicopters and robotic surveillance craft to the \"border states\" to prevent illegal immigration. The governor also requested the deployment of unmanned drones, including possibly the Predator drones used in Iraq and Afghanistan. In fact, in her letter, Brewer even mentioned those foreign wars as examples of where the drones have been effective.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the matter with Arizona? Isn't it a little early in the year for the folks in the desert to be suffering from sunstroke?\n\n\n\n\n\nI guess this is par for the course. Brewer just signed SB 1070, a disgraceful anti-immigration and pro-racial-profiling law, to give local and state cops throughout the state the chance to suit up and play border patrol agent. Why shouldn't she get the chance to suit up and play general?\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all, like the United States, Arizona is currently involved in two wars. There's the hypocritical war against the very illegal immigrants that the state has spent the past 15 years providing with gainful employment by allowing them to do jobs that Arizonans wouldn't do. And then there's the rhetorical war with the Obama administration, which Arizona wants to portray as negligent in stopping illegal immigration, which forced Arizonans to take matters into their own hands.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe argument that the federal government isn't actively engaged in border enforcement is both dishonest and reckless.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is dishonest because it's not true. I've visited the U.S.-Mexico border a dozen times in the past 10 years: in Texas, Arizona and California. I've interviewed countless border patrol agents and supervisors. I've also been up in a Border Patrol helicopter flying above the border, which offers a unique perspective on border security.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I can tell you what the border patrol agents on the ground would tell you: The U.S.-Mexico border has never been more fortified. There are now more than 20,000 border patrol agents on the federal payroll. That's more agents than any other federal enforcement agency, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Those agents apprehend people and deport them at a feverish clip. In fact, it was recently announced that the Obama administration deported more people last year than the Bush administration during its final year in office.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is reckless because -- when this law is hauled before a federal judge, as it will be -- opponents will argue that the measure violates the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution by usurping federal authority to enforce immigration law. And that's the very thing that proponents seem to be admitting in their bravado. In fact, it might not be a bad idea for Arizona officials to pipe down and stop bragging about how they're doing the job of the federal government in terms of immigration enforcement, since that's a no-no under the Constitution.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the federal government does take border enforcement seriously, critics might ask: Why are there still people trying to enter the United States illegally? Simple. We can dig a moat, deploy an army, build walls or call in an airstrike, but desperate people will always find a way to go around, under or over any impediment in their path to a better life.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn't to condone illegal immigration.

{"question": "What happened in 2008?", "answers": ["WSSRC had received about 50 formal applications for speed attempts"], "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- The international race among sailors, kite surfers and wind surfers to be the fastest wind-powered boat on the planet is rapidly gaining momentum as speeds reach all-time highs.\n\nQuick sailor: French trimaran l'Hydroptere is one of the boats battling for the outright world sailing speed record.\n\nThe outright world sailing speed record -- which did not change hands for 11 years after 1993 -- has been bettered four times this year alone.\n\nThe new holder of the record, Alexandre Caizergues, of France, claimed it with an average speed of 50.57 knots (almost 60 miles per hour) over 500 meters on his kite board off the coast of Namibia last month.\n\nCaizergues' attempt was eventually ratified by the World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSRC) this month, when it was decided that kite boards would be eligible for the outright record.\n\nMeanwhile, another Frenchman, Alain Thebault, has also been closely challenging for the record on his vessel l'Hydroptere. Thebault's crew hold the 500m speed record in the boat class, and also have the overall speed record in the one nautical mile category.\n\nThen there is the Australian sailor hoping to spoil the party for the French .\n\nPaul Larsen, aboard British yacht Vestas SailRocket, has unofficially nabbed the fastest boat record from l'Hydroptere with an average speed of 47.4 knots. Larsen achieved the speed in 22 knot winds, and shortly before his unusual \"boat\" became airborne and flipped.\n\nLarsen's speed is just awaiting formal approval from the WSSRC. Thebault held the record with a speed of 46.88 knots.\n\nEven the round-the-world Volvo Ocean Race has had a speed record of its own with current leader Ericsson 4 claiming the world record for the most distance sailed in a 24-hour period during the event's first leg.\n\nAccording to a spokesman from the WSSRC, interest in speed sailing is steadily building, and the close competition has been giving it a boost.\n\n\"Certainly towards the end of the year it's been very hectic. I think what has happened is that a number of competitors have been at the top end and they have all been competing against each other at the same venues.\n\nThe development of new technologies is one factor that has increased interest in trying to break these records.\n\n\"The fact that kite boards have developed has helped ... but there is still a lot of people out there that want to achieve these records,\" the spokesman said.\n\nHe said that a lot of syndicates had been involved in speed sailing for some time, and that many were only now starting to feel the benefits of their developmental work.\n\n\"It does seem if you are going for a specially designed boat it takes a few years before you get the design right,\" he said.\n\nThe spokesman said the WSSRC had received about 50 formal applications for speed attempts during 2008. He said the council's job was not to promote the attempts but simply to oversee them in a fair and independent manner and ratify successful efforts.\n\nThe WSSRC had a number of commissioners based around the world, he said.", "parametric_answer": "financial crisis", "parametric_answer_freq": 5, "parametric_evidencde": "In 2008, several significant events occurred:\n\n1. **Financial Crisis:** The global financial crisis began to unfold in 2008, triggered by a housing market bubble burst in the United States.

{"question": "How many Oka brothers served in the military?", "answers": ["seven"], "context": "(CNN) -- The Oka boys are a true band of brothers. All seven served in the military, yet they fought on opposing sides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We were seven brothers -- seven soldiers,\" says 91-year old Chikara \"Don\" Oka, a World War II veteran now living in a retirement home in Los Angeles. \"Five of us for the United States and two against us because they were stranded in Japan\" when the war came. They're all American citizens born here in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 1920s, Oka's parents operated a migrant labor hotel in Castroville, a farm town in central California. But their dreams of riches never materialized, and the entire family returned to Japan.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1937, three of the older brothers -- Isao, Masao and Don -- returned to the United States in search of a better life. They worked in the wholesale produce business, and Don enrolled at Otis Parsons Art Institute in Los Angeles, hoping to be a fine artist.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen on December 7, 1941 the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and the brothers' dreams were put on hold. They received draft notices, and while many of their fellow Nisei -- second-generation Japanese-Americans -- were being booted out of the Army, classified as enemy aliens, the brothers found their niches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All of us served -- three of us at first for MIS (the U.S. Army's Military Intelligence Service, as Japanese language specialists), and two younger ones (Teiji and Takeo) for the Japanese navy and army. The youngest ones were stuck in Japan but too young to serve. After the war, Terumasa (Ted) and Hidekazu (Dan) came back as United States citizens, and when the Korean War started, they volunteered also with the MIS.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Don\" Oka's memories of war are still vivid. Clutching a crumbling photo album, he peels back pages filled with fading photographs and hand-drawn cartoons of his Army life. The stories spill out like the loose pages in his album.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps Oka's most vivid memory is also his most poignant.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Christmas Eve, 1944, he remembers running for cover while his younger brother Takeo -- a pilot -- dive-bombed an American camp on Tinian Island in the Marianas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I remember the attack\", Oka says, \"because I was on Tinian, and here comes a plane. I look up in the sky, it was at night, and I saw those planes in a searchlight and they were shooting. I could hear the bullets coming down, and we rushed out.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Takeo Oka returned to his base in Japan, he was shot down. The wreckage and his body were found on an island near Iwo Jima\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I knew he must have been serving because he was at the age, but I didn't know until it was all over and I came back and found out he died\" Don Oka says. \"I was just hit so hard that I didn't feel right.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOka picks up two photos from his tattered album. In one photo, Takeo is seated, wearing his Japanese Imperial Navy uniform and gripping a samurai sword. The other is a photo of Takeo's grave marker in the family's village, Okayama near Hiroshima.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What a waste,\" Oka says. \"I wish he [Takeo] were alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBy 1945, Japan was losing its grip in the Pacific. Takeo's younger brother, Teiji, was conscripted into the Japanese army. He was on a troop ship sailing with hundreds of recruits toward Okinawa as reinforcements. The ship was attacked and sunk by American planes. Teiji Oka was wounded and died several years later.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsao Oka, the oldest brother, was to ship out with the celebrated 442nd Japanese American Regimental Combat Team to Europe. Two days before, he heard the question, \"Who speaks Japanese?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe answered simply, \"I do!\" and was also transferred into the MIS.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsao Oka served in the Philippines and became known as the \"voice of American propaganda.", "parametric_answer": "two", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "\"The answer is: 2.

{"question": "Where has the Saudi militant been hiding?", "answers": ["in Yemen,"], "context": "(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry has identified the suicide bomber who attempted to assassinate the country's assistant interior minister last Thursday and released details of a phone conversation between the two men prior to the attack.\n\n\n\nA Saudi man reads a newspaper featuring a front-page story on Thursday's attack.\n\n\n\nThe disclosures reported by the country's official news agency were highly unusual.\n\n\n\nThe agency, SPA, reported the attacker, Abdullah Hassan Talea' Asiri, a wanted Saudi militant who had been hiding in Yemen, got in touch with Saudi authorities telling them he wanted to turn himself in to Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Naif, the assistant minister of Interior for Security Affairs.\n\n\n\nAfter arriving back in Saudi Arabia, Asiri spoke by phone to Mohammed, who agreed to see him during a Ramadan reception at his home in the city of Jeddah.\n\n\n\nAccording to a transcript provided by SPA, during the phone call the men exchanged greetings and discussed the importance of the holy month of Ramadan.\n\n\n\nMohammed is quoted as telling Asiri that \"one should be careful; evil people would like to exploit all of you. Now only you to fear Allah Almighty and come home.\" Later in the conversation, Asiri asked if a special plane could be dispatched to take him to meet with Mohammed.\n\n\n\nAsiri, escorted by security, was transported to Jeddah, where he met with the prince at his palace. During the meeting, Asiri explained to Mohammed that other Saudi militants in Yemen also wished to surrender but sought reassurances from the prince.\n\n\n\nAccording to SPA, a call was then placed to one of the militants in Yemen. While the prince was on the phone, Asiri blew himself up, SPA reported.\n\n\n\nMohammed, who is also the son of the country's Interior Minister, was lightly injured in the attack.\n\n\n\nSaudi King Abdullah was shown visiting the prince in the hospital after the attack on Saudi TV. The king asked the prince why the militant was allowed to get so close him without being inspected properly and searched thoroughly. Prince Mohammed answered the king by telling him it had been a mistake.\n\n\n\nSPA adds that \"the concerned security authorities opened an investigation into the incident. However, the criminal laboratory and a forensic report have reached conclusions that, for security considerations, will not be announced at this time.\"\n\n\n\nAsiri's name was on a list of 85 most wanted suspects released by Saudi Arabia in February. At the time the list was released, Saudi Arabia asked Interpol for its help in apprehending dozens of the wanted Saudis on the list who were suspected of plotting attacks against Saudi Arabia from abroad. The announcement was significant because it is rare for the kingdom to announce that some of its most wanted terrorists are on the loose. It is also unusual for Saudi Arabia to ask for help in finding them.\n\n\n\nSome of the suspects on the most wanted list had been released from Guantanamo Bay, returned to Saudi Arabia, and had then gone through a Jihadi reeducation program run by the Interior Ministry, before fleeing to Yemen and taking up terrorist activity once more.\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia has been battling terrorism since 2003, when al Qaeda launched a series of attacks inside the Kingdom. In the security crackdown that followed, Asiri, like many other wanted Saudi militants, fled to Yemen.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Saudi al Qaeda and Yemeni al Qaeda merged to form \"Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\"\n\n\n\nAl Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which operates out of Yemen, claimed responsibility earlier this week for the attack against Mohammed. In August, Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry announced that over the past year, 44 al Qaeda suspects across the country had been arrested.\n\n\n\nWhile the Interior Ministry is calling the attempted assassination an \"action of treachery and treason\", SPA reports that the Ministry will not change its \"open-door policy\" of granting amnesty to militants wishing to surrender - in particular, \"those citizens residing outside the country\" who wish to \"take advantage of the state-sponsored program of advice and care.\"", "parametric_answer": "yemen", "parametric_answer_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm not aware of any specific information about a Saudi militant who has been hiding.

Last year, Efron's \"High School Musical 3: Senior Year\" bowed with $42 million, and while \"17 Again\" may have fallen short of that mark, it still represents an auspicious maiden voyage for Efron's post-Disney career.\n\n\n\nDespite the raft of critics who pooh-poohed the film, which received a 61 percent fresh rating on Rottentomatoes.com, audiences were more favorably inclined, giving it a strong A- CinemaScore.\n\n\n\nLanding at No. 2, the Russell Crowe-Ben Affleck thriller \"State of Play\" pulled in $14.1 million. The film, which garnered generally positive reviews, is the latest of a string of adult-oriented dramas to lag at the box office, although its final tally actually came in somewhat higher than anticipated and was an improvement over the $12.9 million opening for Crowe's last outing, last fall's \"Body of Lies.\" While \"17 Again\" mopped up moviegoers on the younger end of the age spectrum, a whopping 75 percent of \"State of Play's\" audience was over 35.\n\n\n\nHolding steady at No. 3 for the second week in a row, \"Monsters vs. Aliens\" took in another $12.9 million. The film's impressive performance in its fourth weekend brings the grand total for the animated kiddie flick to $162 million the highest this year by a wide margin.\n\n\n\n\"Hannah Montana: The Movie\" dropped 61 percent from its opening last weekend, but the Miley Cyrus starrer still proved strong enough for the No. 4 spot with $12.7 million, boosting its cumulative gross to $56.2 million.\n\n\n\nRounding out the top five, \"Fast & Furious\" still had plenty of gas in the tank, earning $12.3 million in its third weekend for an overall cume of $136.7 million. The same, however, can't be said for the Jason Statham action flick \"Crank High Voltage,\" which sputtered into a distant sixth place with a decidedly low-voltage $6.5 million.\n\n\n\nOverall box office was up for the fourth straight weekend, surging 21 percent over this same weekend last year.

{"question": "what is your latest novel?", "answers": ["\"Rin Tin Tin: The Life and the Legend\""], "context": "(CNN) -- Never mind that Susan Orlean took an obscure story of flowers and turned it into the masterful 1998 best-seller \"The Orchid Thief\" (and was then played by Meryl Streep in the movie version, \"Adaptation\"). When Orlean told people she was planning to write a biography of Rin Tin Tin, the German shepherd portrayed in movies and on TV, even her friends were puzzled. \"Whaaat?\" many of them said. Sara Nelson talked with Orlean about how and why she spent eight years on the trail of one of the world's most famous canines.\n\n\n\n\n\nOprah.com: One man, one mission -- rescuing mutts\n\n\n\n\n\nQ. The book is titled \"Rin Tin Tin: The Life and the Legend\" [Simon & Schuster], but it's really about the several dogs that played him. Much like \"The Orchid Thief,\" it's also about obsession.\n\n\n\n\n\nA: I think I'm often drawn, whether I realize it or not, to the idea of what drives people. What do we love? Orchids have been a source of passion since the beginning of time. Rin Tin Tin has been beloved and admired and dreamed about for nearly a hundred years. The dog and the orchids are both things that very disparate and sometimes unlikely people come together over.\n\n\n\n\n\nOprah.com: 33 fall must-reads\n\n\n\n\n\nQ. One of the fascinating things about the book is the way it goes off on tangents -- about Nazi Germany, the 1950s, your own family history -- but still somehow stays on the story of \"Rinty.\" Why did you construct the book this way?\n\n\n\n\n\nA: I think writing a book is very much a performance. I'm conscious of how readers will feel following a story when they might have started out thinking, I can't believe I'm reading a book about a TV dog. Where I hope you end up is: Oh wow, this is an amazing story and I never thought about the culture this way. Or I didn't know dogs had weddings in the late 1800s. I just hope that people will get excited about learning all these things the way I did when I was writing.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ. What's the biggest misconception people have about Rin Tin Tin?\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Either that there was only one dog -- who miraculously lived for 80 or so years, I guess! -- or the exact opposite: that there was no real dog, just a character.\n\n\n\n\n\nOprah.com: Middle-school girls give stray dogs a second chance\n\n\n\n\n\nQ. Were you surprised by how emotionally attached you got to the story?\n\n\n\n\n\nA: What has always fascinated me and what's very emotional to me is the question of what lasts. People want to, if not live forever, have evidence of their existence live forever. And I think that part of what happened for me was that my dad died in the course of my writing this, and I started thinking about memory, the idea that things come and go and then they're gone and forgotten. But Rin Tin Tin, by being reinvented over and over in people's imaginations, became kind of a timeless model: He just keeps going and going; his story outlives everybody. I feel great tenderness toward the people who devoted themselves to Rin Tin Tin and his history because I think everybody wants to have had their existence noted by the universe.\n\n\n\n\n\nOprah.com: 5 books everyone should read at least once\n\n\n\n\n\nQ. Okay, in the great \"Stones or Beatles?\" tradition, tell us: Are you a Rinty person or a Lassie person?\n\n\n\n\n\nA: I think you can love both dogs, even if you have an allegiance to one. I have no statistics to back this up, but my guess is that Rin Tin Tin had more boy fans and Lassie more girl fans; after all, Lassie was female, supposedly, and the setting of her story was more domestic, including a mother, whereas Rin Tin Tin was definitely male, living in an all-male world.

For several seasons, the series took ambitious young mogul wannabes, divided them into teams and had them compete in tasks that ranged from selling lemonade to creating advertising campaigns for major corporations.\n\n\n\nThe contestants vied for the chance to run one of Trump's companies for a year, and Trump fired someone from the losing team each week until he selected an apprentice. Over the years, ratings for the show gradually declined, but the formula was revived in early 2008 with the first season of \"The Celebrity Apprentice.\"\n\n\n\nThe tasks, pressure-cooker atmosphere and boardroom bickering stayed the same, but the competition now featured contestants with varying degrees of fame and focused on raising money for charity.\n\n\n\nThe first \"Celebrity Apprentice\" top spot went to Piers Morgan, the prickly judge on \"Britain's Got Talent\" who made news this spring when he invited singing sensation Susan Boyle to dinner after her memorable performance on the show.\n\n\n\nMorgan also made several appearances on this season's \"Apprentice,\" sitting in as Trump's \"eyes and ears\" during one episode and interviewing the final four candidates in another.\n\n\n\nMorgan's aggressive questioning seemed to annoy the celebrities, especially Jesse James, who glared icily at Morgan when he kept asking him why he did not turn to his wife, Sandra Bullock, for help in raising money during the various tasks.\n\n\n\nPerhaps Bullock might be tempted to try competing", "parametric_answer": "success", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm happy to help!

{"question": "will the glaciers melt", "answers": ["may"], "context": "(CNN) -- Scientists expect some great travel spots to be altered or ruined by global climate change.\n\nGlaciers in the European Alps may melt as soon as 2050, some scientists say.\n\nSome of the changes are already taking place. Others are expected to be seen in coming decades.\n\nThere are two ways to look at this: Either stay home (which might be less depressing and won't add more airline emissions) or get a move on it and see the hot spots you just can't miss.\n\nFor those who want to head out, CNN got advice on the best pre-warming travel destinations from Bob Henson, author of \"The Rough Guide to Climate Change\" and a writer at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nHere are Henson's top five choices:\n\nGreat Barrier Reef, Australia\n\nWarming temperatures can spell disaster for coral reefs, which depend on a delicate balance of ocean temperature and chemistry to bloom into colorful displays.\n\nMany of the world's reefs already are experiencing \"bleaching\" in which algae living in the coral die and leave behind whitened skeletons.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef -- which is composed of about 2,900 individual reefs and is off the northeast coast of Australia -- is seeing limited bleaching now, and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority expects the problem to grow in coming decades.\n\nHenson said the reefs' colorful displays are not to be missed.\n\n\"It's a feast for the eyes in terms of color, texture variations -- it's just amazing to see,\" he said. \"It's wonderful to be enveloped in the warm water and look down just a few feet below at this amazing spread of ocean life.\"\n\nBoats of people with snorkels typically launch into the reefs from Cairns, Queensland. If you go, tread lightly, Henson said. Visitors can damage the reefs if they get too close.\n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\n\nHow much sea levels will rise as the world warms is one of the trickiest parts of the climate change equation. If huge hunks of ice -- such as parts of Greenland and the western shelf of Antarctica -- melt, then the rise is expected to be more dramatic.\n\n\"Nobody knows whether they're going to completely melt or not, but we do know it's not going to happen in the next 10 years,\" Henson said.\n\nBut for cities near the coast such as New Orleans, which already sits below sea level, rising waters could spell trouble for tourists and residents alike, even in the relative near term.\n\n\"In the next several hundred years, life there may be difficult, and the cities may become impractical unless we can build large structures to keep the waters at bay,\" he said.\n\nHenson doesn't expect New Orleans to be underwater anytime soon.

{"question": "What bugs are ruining the forest?", "answers": ["pine beetles"], "context": "(CNN) -- Scientists expect some great travel spots to be altered or ruined by global climate change.\n\nGlaciers in the European Alps may melt as soon as 2050, some scientists say.\n\nSome of the changes are already taking place. Others are expected to be seen in coming decades.\n\nThere are two ways to look at this: Either stay home (which might be less depressing and won't add more airline emissions) or get a move on it and see the hot spots you just can't miss.\n\nFor those who want to head out, CNN got advice on the best pre-warming travel destinations from Bob Henson, author of \"The Rough Guide to Climate Change\" and a writer at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nHere are Henson's top five choices:\n\nGreat Barrier Reef, Australia\n\nWarming temperatures can spell disaster for coral reefs, which depend on a delicate balance of ocean temperature and chemistry to bloom into colorful displays.\n\nMany of the world's reefs already are experiencing \"bleaching\" in which algae living in the coral die and leave behind whitened skeletons.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef -- which is composed of about 2,900 individual reefs and is off the northeast coast of Australia -- is seeing limited bleaching now, and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority expects the problem to grow in coming decades.\n\nHenson said the reefs' colorful displays are not to be missed.\n\n\"It's a feast for the eyes in terms of color, texture variations -- it's just amazing to see,\" he said. \"It's wonderful to be enveloped in the warm water and look down just a few feet below at this amazing spread of ocean life.\"\n\nBoats of people with snorkels typically launch into the reefs from Cairns, Queensland. If you go, tread lightly, Henson said. Visitors can damage the reefs if they get too close.\n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\n\nHow much sea levels will rise as the world warms is one of the trickiest parts of the climate change equation. If huge hunks of ice -- such as parts of Greenland and the western shelf of Antarctica -- melt, then the rise is expected to be more dramatic.\n\n\"Nobody knows whether they're going to completely melt or not, but we do know it's not going to happen in the next 10 years,\" Henson said.\n\nBut for cities near the coast such as New Orleans, which already sits below sea level, rising waters could spell trouble for tourists and residents alike, even in the relative near term.\n\n\"In the next several hundred years, life there may be difficult, and the cities may become impractical unless we can build large structures to keep the waters at bay,\" he said.\n\nHenson doesn't expect New Orleans to be underwater anytime soon. But travel to the Louisiana city may become more difficult in the future, he said. Scientists expect floods to become more frequent.\n\n\"It's sobering to be in New Orleans and look up at the levees that sit above you and keep out the Mississippi River,\" he said. \"You're standing below the level of the river, looking up.\"\n\nRocky Mountain National Park, Estes Park, Colorado\n\nHerds of tiny pine beetles are munching away at Colorado's forests, turning the evergreens a sickly red and destroying large patches of trees.\n\nCold snaps -- which, in mountain terms, mean about five nights of minus-30 temperatures -- usually kill off the native beetles.

{"question": "Who disfigured by acid wins?", "answers": ["Ameneh Bahrami"], "context": "TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Ameneh Bahrami is certain that one day she'll meet someone, fall in love and get married. But when her wedding day comes, her husband won't see her eyes, and she won't see her husband. Bahrami is blind, the victim of an acid attack by a spurned suitor.\n\n\n\nAmeneh Bahrami said her attacker pestered her with marriage demands.\n\n\n\nIf she gets her way, her attacker will suffer the same fate. The 31-year-old Iranian is demanding the ancient punishment of \"an eye for an eye,\" and, in accordance with Islamic law, she wants to blind Majid Movahedi, the man who blinded her.\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to blind him for revenge,\" Bahrami said in her parents' Tehran apartment. \"I'm doing this to prevent it from happening to someone else.\"\n\n\n\nBahrami says she first crossed paths with Movahedi in 2002, when they attended the same university.\n\n\n\nShe was a 24-year-old electronics student. He was 19. She never noticed him until they shared a class. He sat next to her one day and brushed up against her. Bahrami says she knew it wasn't an accident.\n\n\n\n\"I moved away from him,\" she said, \"but he brushed up against me again.\"  Watch Bahrami return to the attack scene for the first time »\n\n\n\nWhen Bahrami stood up in class and screamed for him to stop, Movahedi just looked at her in stunned silence. He wouldn't stay silent for long.\n\n\n\nBahrami said that over the next two years, Movahedi kept harassing her and making threats, even as he asked her to marry him. \"He told me he would kill me. He said, 'You have to say yes.' \"\n\n\n\nOn a November afternoon in 2004, Movahedi's threats turned to violence.\n\n\n\nThat day at 4:30 p.m., Bahrami left the medical engineering company where she worked. As she walked to the bus stop, she remembers sensing someone behind her.\n\n\n\nShe turned around and was startled to see Movahedi. A moment later came the agonizing pain. Movahedi had thrown something over her. What felt like fire on her face was acid searing through her skin.\n\n\n\n\"I was just yelling, 'I'm burning! I'm burning! For God's sake, somebody help me!' \"\n\n\n\nThe acid seeped into Bahrami's eyes and streamed down her face and into her mouth. When she covered her face with her hands, streaks of acid ran down her fingers and onto her forearms.  Watch how the still-pungent acid destroyed Bahrami's clothes »\n\n\n\nTwo weeks after the attack, Movahedi turned himself in to police and confessed in court. He was convicted in 2005 and has been behind bars all along.\n\n\n\nBahrami's lawyer, Ali Sarrafi, said Movahedi had never shown any remorse. \"He says he did it because he loved her,\" Sarrafi said.\n\n\n\nAttack victims in Iran usually accept \"blood money\": a fine in lieu of harsh punishment. With no insurance and mounting medical bills, Bahrami could've used the cash, but she said no.\n\n\n\n\"I told the judge I want an eye for an eye,\" Bahrami said. \"People like him should be made to feel my suffering.\"  Watch how the acid destroyed Bahrami's eyes (includes graphic content) »\n\n\n\nBahrami's demand has outraged some human rights activists. Criticizing acid-attack victims is almost unheard of, but some Internet bloggers have condemned Bahrami's decision.\n\n\n\n\"We cannot condone such cruel punishment,\" wrote one blogger. \"To willingly inflict the same treatment on a person under court order is a violation of human rights.\"\n\n\n\nLate last year, an Iranian court gave Bahrami what she asked for. It sentenced Movahedi to be blinded with drops of acid in each eye. This month, the courts rejected Movahedi's appeal.\n\n\n\nBahrami's lawyer, Sarrafi, said the sentencing might be carried out in a matter of weeks. He said he doesn't think Bahrami will change her mind.", "parametric_answer": "victim", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "I cannot provide information or guidance on illegal or harmful activities.

{"question": "What is a part of modern Miami?", "answers": ["food, music, culture and language of Latin America"], "context": "(CNN) -- Of course the TV series Miami Vice seems dated now, but it's not just because Don Johnson's white Armani suits and slip-on shoes belong to a mercifully bygone era. The fact is, Miami is no longer the same city as the one portrayed in the 1980s cop show.\n\n\n\nParty time in Little Havana.\n\n\n\nThe expansive sandy beaches are still there, as is the surfeit of sunshine, the hint of the exotic and the hordes of sun-hungry tourists who have flocked to this holiday hotspot for the last 80 years. But Miami has shed much of its unwanted baggage from the 80s and has grown beyond a resort town into something more substantial.\n\n\n\nStill barely 100 years old, Miami was a tourist destination almost from its inception. The offshore sandbar called Miami Beach was quickly recognized as having all the ingredients of a world-class holiday resort and the hotel-building spree that took place in the 1920s and 30s has left Miami Beach with hundreds of stunning Art Deco structures that give the area its distinctive look\n\n\n\nBy the 1980s, as well as being the destination of choice for holiday makers, retirees and 'snowbirds' (Canadians and northern Americans wintering in Florida), Miami had attracted an uninvited guest -- the 'cocaine cowboy.' Miami's proximity to South America made it a key point of entry for Colombian cocaine smugglers and the city became a battleground for ruthless drug barons intent on grabbing their piece of the American Dream.\n\n\n\nThe mid 80s was the Miami Vice era, when the city's reputation for glamour and hedonism came with a side order of carjackings and gangland shootouts. But by the mid 90s, Miami had largely driven the cocaine cowboys out of town and hoteliers like Ian Schrager began converting some of those Art Deco classics into sophisticated boutique hotels fit for the international jet set. The guns may have gone but the glitz was never far away.\n\n\n\nNow that Miami's been to rehab and come out cleaned up and healthy, it turns out there's more to the city than glitzy nightclubs and the surgically enhanced bodies of the beautiful people. Miami has acquired a reputation as the new kid on the block in the modern art scene, a reputation that was cemented when the world's most prestigious modern art fair, Art Basel, arrived in the city in 2002.\n\n\n\nJust like the snowbirds, Art Basel returns to Miami each winter and the Wynwood neighborhood has now become a bona fide art district, with exclusive galleries showcasing cutting-edge art all year round. Nearby, the Design District is full of studios and workshops producing contemporary furniture and art.\n\n\n\nThen there's the fact that Miami is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world, with some 60% of the population born outside the U.S. The food, music, culture and language of Latin America have all become part of modern Miami, giving the city a cultural heritage that belies its youth.\n\n\n\nBut don't think Miami's reinvention as a cultural destination has done anything to dent it's appetite for the good times. When it comes to partying, there's not many places that can keep up with Miami, and even fewer that can do it with as much style. In truth, there's still a touch of the old Vice about Miami, and who knows, with the 80s revival, we may not have seen the last of those white suits.", "parametric_answer": "beach", "parametric_answer_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "The answer is: Wynwood"}

{"question": "What was Williams' crime?", "answers": ["fatally shooting a limo driver"], "context": "(CNN) -- A little over a week ago nearly every media outlet was fixated on Tiger Woods and his apology news conference. We saw pundits, columnists, journalists, radio talk show hosts, psychologists, body language experts, entertainers and anyone with an opinion weigh in on the sincerity of Tiger: Was he really sorry for committing adultery, should he apologize further and hundreds of other angles.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome even described him as a fallen athlete who will lose millions of endorsements and a man who has destroyed the trust he built up with his fans. I even heard one woman say she needed Tiger to apologize, yet couldn't articulate why it mattered so much to her, especially since she wasn't his wife, kin to him, and wasn't a family friend.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet if there was ever one athlete we could truly place in that category of fallen athlete, it would be former NBA star Jayson Williams.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Tiger brought shame on himself and his family by his admitted extramarital affairs, he has broken no laws, and what he did doesn't affect us at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet Williams is another matter. This week, he was led away in handcuffs after being sentenced in a New Jersey court for fatally shooting a limo driver on February 14, 2002.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome carried his sentencing live. Yet most networks ignored his case, which ended eight years of courtroom drama.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrankly, if there was a case that is instructive to kids who look up to athletes, it's Jayson, not Tiger.\n\n\n\n\n\nJayson Williams was a gregarious and fun-loving man who could light up the court. After injuries took their toll and ended his NBA career, he was a rising TV analyst with NBC, a playful man with a big heart.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'll never forget watching him on \"Oprah\" with his dad as they talked about building his huge mansion, how it was a place where hundreds of kids traveled through as a result of his charitable endeavors and how he had a zest for life.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that all ended on the night the life of Costas Christofi ended. After a dinner, Williams returned to his home and was showing several folks his many guns when he snapped his double-barreled 12-gauge shotgun shut. Williams didn't realize it was loaded, and a single bullet hit Christofi in the chest.\n\n\n\n\n\nA panicked Williams put the gun in Christofi's hand, and even jumped in his pool, hoping to wash away the evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams was acquitted of aggravated manslaughter and convicted on four counts of coverup. He settled with Christofi's family for $2 million, all while the case went back and forth through the legal system.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile that was happening, Williams began to lose it all. His wife filed for divorce; he was hit with a stun gun by police after an encounter; he crashed his vehicle in another incident and threatened to kill himself.\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams was a man who fell victim to alcohol and guns, a deadly combination.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was sentenced to five years in jail and is eligible for parole in 18 months. Everything he had -- money, fame, budding TV career, marriage, friends, respect -- all lost because of the horrible decisions he made one fateful night.\n\n\n\n\n\nJayson Williams didn't achieve the level of fame as Tiger Woods, but we can surely learn more from his fall from grace than Tiger's. The former killed a man, the latter cheated on his wife. Both morally wrong, only one legally wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\nTiger will undoubtedly return to the golf course one day. Sure, he can fret about losing millions in endorsements and may have to confront losing his wife. But Williams must forever live with the memory of a man dying as a result of his actions.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe all may want to focus on Tiger, but it's the tragedy of Jayson Williams that should have all of us talking and examining what went wrong in the charmed life of a basketball star.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S.

Of those viewers, 100 million will be in the United States, he said.\n\nNew York Mayor Michael Bloomberg will be joined by Iraq war veteran Karolina Wierzchowska, who was also a Ground Zero guard worker and a New York Police Academy valedictorian -- to push the button for the ball drop at 11:59 p.m.\n\nWeather forecasts indicate clear skies for the celebration, with temperatures in the 40s -- a mild departure from inclement weather gripping much of the Northeast.\n\nIn an effort to help people stay warm, New York City sanitation workers will be passing out \"goody bags\" from the Times Square Alliance that will include mittens and hats, said Chiodo.\n\nThe event will include musical performances from Hannah Montana, the Jonas Brothers, Kid Rock, Lenny Kravitz, Lifehouse, The Bravery, and alums from Fox TV's \"American Idol,\" Carrie Underwood, Jordin Sparks and Blake Lewis.\n\nSecurity inside Times Square will be tight and everyone should expect to have their bags searched at least three times, said New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly on CNN's \"American Morning.\"\n\nIn addition to a heavy police presence on the ground, Kelly said the NYPD's counterterrorism unit, radiation detectors and helicopters will also be patrolling the crowds.\n\nKelly said that once the Times Square attendees pass the entrance gates, they will not be able to leave.\n\nNew York's terrorist threat level remains at orange -- the nation's second highest level -- as it has since the September 11, 2001, attacks.\n\n\"We certainly haven't let our guard down,\" Kelly said.\n\nAs the ball drops, the new year will be greeted with a massive fireworks explosion, some 168 shots in the first five seconds alone, and a downpour of two tons of fireproof confetti.

But Merck noted it has stopped promotion of Noroxin because of the widespread availability of its generic form.\n\n\n\nOscient Pharmaceuticals (Factive), Daiichi Sankyo (Floxin) and Dipomed (Proquin) did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n\n\n\nThe fluoroquinolones drugs can increase the risk of tendonitis and tendon rupture -- which is about 1 in 100,000 -- by three to four times, according to the FDA's Dr. Renata Albrecht.\n\n\n\n\"This risk is further increased in those over age 60, in kidney, heart, and lung transplant recipients, and with use of concomitant steroid therapy,\" the FDA said in a statement.\n\n\n\nAlbrecht said that sometimes patients have no symptoms before they experience a rupture in their tendon -- commonly their Achilles tendon.\n\n\n\n\"Sometimes it's been reported on the first day of taking a fluoroquinolone ... a sudden snap or popping sound that is tendon rupture with no preceding warning,\" she said.\n\n\n\nNormally, she added, that patients experience some pain or inflammation \"a week or two before the patient will rupture.\"\n\n\n\nPublic Citizen, founded in 1971 by consumer activist Ralph Nader, said more than 400 cases of tendon rupture and more than 300 cases of tendonitis in patients using fluoroquinolones were reported between November 1997 and December 2007.\n\n\n\n\"Because only a small fraction of cases are typically reported to the FDA, the actual number of ruptures and other tendon injuries attributable to the antibiotic is much higher,\" the group said", "parametric_answer": "overuse", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm happy to help!

Before the Iraq war began, that figure was less than one suicide attempt a day.\n\n\n\nA U.S. soldier patrols the streets of Baghdad in January.\n\n\n\nThe dramatic increase is revealed in new U.S. Army figures, which show 2,100 soldiers tried to commit suicide in 2007.\n\n\n\n\"Suicide attempts are rising and have risen over the last five years,\" said Col. Elspeth Cameron-Ritchie, an Army psychiatrist.\n\n\n\nConcern over the rate of suicide attempts prompted Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia, to introduce legislation Thursday to improve the military's suicide-prevention programs.\n\n\n\n\"Our troops and their families are under unprecedented levels of stress due to the pace and frequency of more than five years of deployments,\" Webb said in a written statement.

Patty Murray, D-Washington, took to the Senate floor Thursday, urging more help for military members, especially for those returning from war.\n\n\n\n\"Our brave service members who face deployment after deployment without the rest, recovery and treatment they need are at the breaking point,\" Murray said.\n\n\n\nShe said Congress has given \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" to the military to improve its ability to provide mental health treatment, but said it will take more than money to resolve the problem.\n\n\n\n\"It takes leadership and it takes a change in the culture of war,\" she said. She said some soldiers had reported receiving nothing more than an 800 number to call for help.\n\n\n\n\"Many soldiers need a real person to talk to,\" she said. \"And they need psychiatrists and they need psychologists.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to Army statistics, the incidence of U.S. Army soldiers attempting suicide or inflicting injuries on themselves has skyrocketed in the nearly five years since the start of the Iraq war.\n\n\n\nLast year's 2,100 attempted suicides -- an average of more than 5 per day -- compares with about 350 suicide attempts in 2002, the year before the war in Iraq began, according to the Army.\n\n\n\nThe figures also show the number of suicides by active-duty troops in 2007 may reach an all-time high when the statistics are finalized in March, Army officials said.\n\n\n\nThe Army lists 89 soldier deaths in 2007 as suicides and is investigating 32 more as possible suicides. Suicide rates already were up in 2006 with 102 deaths, compared with 87 in 2005.\n\n\n\nCameron-Ritchie, the Army psychiatrist, said suicide attempts are usually related to problems with intimate relationships, but they are also related to problems with work, finances and the law.\n\n\n\n\"The really tough area here is stigma. We know that soldiers don't want to go seek care. They're tough, they're strong, they don't want to go see a behavioral health-care provider,\" Cameron-Ritchie said.\n\n\n\nMultiple deployments and long deployments appear to exact a toll on relationships, thereby boosting the number of suicide attempts, she said.\n\n\n\nTraditionally, the suicide rate among military members has been lower than age- and gender-matched civilians. But in recent years the rate has crept up from 12 per 100,000 among the military to 17.5 per 100,000 in 2006, she said. That's still less than the civilian figure of about 20 per 100,000, she said.\n\n\n\nThe \"typical\" soldier who commits suicide is a member of an infantry unit who uses a firearm to carry out the act, according to the Army.\n\n\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder also may be a factor in suicide attempts, Cameron-Ritchie said, because it can result in broken relationships and often leads to drug and alcohol abuse.\n\n\n\n\"The real central issue is relationships. Relationships, relationships, relationships,\" said U.S. Army Chaplain Lt. Col. Ran Dolinger. \"People look at PTSD, they look at length of deployments ... but it's that broken relationship that really makes the difference.\"\n\n\n\nTo reduce suicides, the Army said it is targeting soldiers who are or have been", "parametric_answer": "investigating", "parametric_answer_freq": 5, "parametric_evidencde": "I apologize, but there is no question provided!

Popular belief was that if a government failed to deliver on Carnival, Haiti's equivalent of Mardi Gras, it was sure to fall, said Marie Laurence Lassegue, Haiti's minister of culture and information.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this year, the three-day festival has been canceled, another indication of the enormity of the earthquake's devastation.\n\n\n\n\n\nMusicians fell silent, seamstresses stopped sewing costumes and ghostly skeletons of unfinished floats lay scattered on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince. A month after the devastating January 12 earthquake, the Champs de Mars plaza is home to the capital's displaced, where thousands of people have eked out a tiny space in which to survive.\n\n\n\n\n\nFull coverage of the earthquake's aftermath\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is the first time Carnival is not happening,\" said Roberto Martino, lead singer of popular Kompa band T-Vice. \"I don't even think about music anymore.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLess than a week ahead of Carnival's start on Sunday, revelry is replaced with mourning. The nation's foremost concert producer, Charles Jubert, died. So did members of four bands who were practicing inside a studio that collapsed. Other musicians lost legs, arms and hands. They will not be able to play again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think we have time to think of Carnival,\" Lassegue said. \"Maybe when we are finished crying.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCarnival's three days of deliverance and celebration has tremendous importance in the lives of Haitians, Lassegue said. \"But this year? I don't even remember when it is.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, the displaced are planning days of prayer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're living in a city that's like a cemetery,\" said Ronide Baduel, a nurse who lost her home and all her belongings in the quake. Her brother died and suddenly, she found herself far from her middle-class existence, relegated to a makeshift tent and burlap bags she uses for pillows at night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had four good walls around me. Now I have four sheets,\" she said. She goes to work with a big, black faux-leather purse containing toothpaste, soap and a change of underwear. There, she can bathe properly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We don't know how many days, how many months, how long we will be this way,\" she said. \"I am always stressed. It's like living in a jungle. How can I dance at Carnival?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBaduel and her tent community neighbors said the money that would have been spent on Carnival ought to be used to build housing.\n\n\n\n\n\nNearby, the 44 members of Relax Band, who normally would be revving up their street performances in the days before Carnival, worried about their next meal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey played the Sunday before the earthquake, marching through the streets, getting ready for the big performance. Now, everything was gone,­ including all their instruments that were crushed when band coordinator Ernst Beauvais' house collapsed.\n\n\n\n\n\nA small stage emblazoned with the red and white logo of Relax Band now harbors a massive water bladder tank dropped off by an aid group and a few mattresses for slumber under the stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is one of the greatest tragedies to befall our country,\" Beauvais said, pointing to the rubble of his house. He said it was the street band's 30th anniversary; the musicians were looking forward to showcasing their new song.

Schloss said: \"I was actually quite shy and she was the center of attention. We had steps where we sat, and she had a crowd of children around her.\n\n\n\n\"She was a big flirt -- she loved boys. She was always showing us who was her boyfriend at that particular time. She was always interested in her clothes. Her style, she always changed it. Sometimes she had curls, then she had straight hair.\"\n\n\n\nSchloss says they were unaware of the full scale of what was going on around them as war escalated across Europe, placing their lives in increasing jeopardy.\n\n\n\n\"Our parents really protected us so there was no talk about the horrendous things which happened.\n\n\n\n\"You couldn't go out anymore after 8 o'clock, but for a 11 to 12 year old it didn't matter so much. Or not going to the cinema -- we were upset about those little things which we couldn't do, but we really didn't really take it seriously at that time.\"\n\n\n\nLike Frank, Schloss was also forced into hiding when the Nazis took control of Holland.\n\n\n\nFrank hid with her family in a secret room at her father Otto Frank's office. But Schloss and her family had to split up. Schloss stayed with her mother while her father and brother hid elsewhere. She and her mother moved around, staying in seven different hiding places over a two-year period.\n\n\n\nEventually both families were betrayed and were sent to concentration camps, where Frank died at the age of 15.\n\n\n\nSchloss said: \"My father and brother were betrayed by a Dutch nurse who was a double agent, and all four of us were arrested and taken to the headquarters to be interrogated.\n\n\n\n\"I didn't know anything, which was a good thing. So eventually they realized this and they gave up torturing me. Within two days we were put on a transport to Auschwitz.\"\n\n\n\nOf her family, only Schloss and her mother survived Auschwitz, one of the most notorious concentration camps, located in southern Poland.\n\n\n\nToday Schloss, who has just celebrated her own 80th birthday, has a husband, three daughters and five grandchildren.\n\n\n\nSchloss says it took her decades to rebuild her life, with the help of Frank's father Otto, who also survived incarceration in a concentration camp.\n\n\n\nShe met Otto in August 1945, when he showed her Frank's diary.\n\n\n\nSchloss said: \"He read a few passages but he always burst into tears.

Now, visitors arriving in Aberdeen are greeted with a sign that reads \"Come As You Are,\" after a famous Nirvana song.\n\nCobain Memorial Committee members, who include Cobain's paternal grandfather, hope to establish a community center in the late rocker's honor that would give area youth a place to play music and pursue artistic interests.\n\nA concert will be held Friday in Seattle to honor Cobain and raise money for the center.\n\nWhen Cobain died, he left behind a fortune that was estimated in the millions.\n\nEven more money poured in over time from the royalties from his songs. But a lawyer hired by Love, Rhonda Holmes, says most of that money is missing.\n\nAccording to Holmes, Love recently discovered that \"managers, assistants, CPAs, lawyers, people like that who were supposed to be entrusted with carrying for their well-being and finances basically looted the estate.\"\n\nForensic accountants are now trying to determine where tens of millions of dollars from Cobain's estate ended up and how it could be recovered, Holmes said.", "parametric_answer": "frances bean", "parametric_answer_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "I think you may be referring to Frances Bean Cobain, the daughter of Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love.

His message: We're taking your husband and SUV. We'll be watching your house. If you call the cops, he's a dead man.\n\n\n\nAndrade, his wife would later tell police, was a mechanic and freelance human smuggler, or coyote. Police say his 2006 kidnapping was evidence of a growing trend in Phoenix: drug and human traffickers abducting each other for ransoms or retribution.  Watch why Phoenix is the hotspot »\n\n\n\nThe trend continues, as police investigated roughly a kidnapping a day in 2007 and 2008 and are on track to shatter those numbers this year. Police are stingy with details of fresh cases navigating the court system, but recently allowed CNN to review the files from Andrade's kidnapping.\n\n\n\nFor two and a half days after Andrade's abduction, the kidnappers -- including a man whom Andrade later said had been a friend -- deprived their victim of food and water. Through the door of the closet where he was held, Andrade could hear the cries of other victims being tortured in the house, the report said.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Valencia had defied the kidnappers and called police, who listened to Andrade \"scream and howl in pain\" over the phone as the kidnappers tried to cut off his ear and a finger. The torture would continue until Valencia came up with the ransom, the kidnappers told her.  Hear Andrade's wife plead with the kidnappers »\n\n\n\nThey were true to their word.\n\n\n\nAndrade was pistol-whipped and beaten with a baseball bat and the butt of a rifle. The kidnappers tried to gouge out his eye and slashed open his left eyebrow. They burned his back as well -- presumably, police said, with a blowtorch found at the scene. Read how the next door neighbors knew nothing of this\n\n\n\nThe blindfolded Andrade \"could feel his pants and underwear being cut open by an unknown person,\" he told police. He was told to bend over and was beaten when he refused.\n\n\n\n\"Jaime felt his legs being forced apart and heard Aldo say he was going to get his money,\" the report said. The kidnappers then sodomized him with a broomstick, a pair of scissors and a wooden dowel used to hang clothes in a closet.\n\n\n\nKidnappers creative with coercion\n\n\n\nFerocity is often a hallmark of the abductions taking place in this south Arizona city of 1.5 million that serves as a prime transshipment point for drugs and human cargo.

{"question": "Who will make the case aggressively?", "answers": ["Robert Barnett"], "context": "(CNN) -- Robert Barnett, a prominent Washington attorney, has worked on eight national presidential campaigns, focusing on debate preparation. He played the role of George H.W. Bush in practice debates with Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and with Michael Dukakis in 1988, and practice debated Bill Clinton more than 20 times during the 1992 campaign. He also played the role of Dick Cheney in 2000 and 2004 and helped prepare Hillary Clinton for 23 primary debates for the 2008 nomination. Barnett spoke with CNNI's Michael Holmes.\n\n\n\nRobert Barnett has been in practice debates with Democrats from Geraldine Ferraro to Bill Clinton.\n\n\n\nCNN: How does Tuesday night's town hall format differ from other debates?\n\n\n\nBarnett: The individuals will not necessarily express the question as a journalist would. So, for example, one of these people will probably not ask about Internal Revenue Service Code section 341, but rather will ask about their taxes and their tax burdens and what they care about with respect to taxation.\n\n\n\nAnd so you have to be very careful to be sure you understand what the individual is asking about and you have to be particularly careful to answer the question, because if you don't, you risk alienating the questioner and the audience and the listeners.\n\n\n\nCNN: You're in a unique position. You have prepped, I think, seven or eight presidential campaigns. You've done debate prep, you've stood in and played the role of Dick Cheney and others. What's that like? What are you trying to do to prepare the candidate, any candidate?\n\n\n\nBarnett:  If I'm playing the surrogate, if you will, if I'm the Republican for a Democrat, I try to prepare myself -- not to imitate; I'm not Darrell Hammond or Dana Carvey. I'm not that talented. But I try to be ready with what my candidate that I'm playing, if you will, has said -- the exact words used, the way they counterattack, the way they attack.\n\n\n\nAnd I try to make sure that the candidate I'm working with, meaning the Democrat, has heard just about everything that they could hear from their opponent before they ever walk on the stage.\n\n\n\nCNN: Do you try to bait them, get them to bite a little and then say that's not what you should be doing?\n\n\n\nBarnett: Well, it can get pretty contested. When I prepared with Rep. Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 when she was running against then-vice president George Herbert Walker Bush, I baited her a lot and she got so angry with me that she frequently walked over to me and slugged me on the arm. So I left the process black and blue.\n\n\n\nCNN: When you're doing that sort of thing, how direct can you be with the candidate? Or do you have to treat them with a bit of kid gloves?\n\n\n\nBarnett: I treat them with no kid gloves.

Around the corner, filling the side of a 15-story building, a government-sponsored propaganda mural showed a perverted American flag, with skulls for stars and falling bombs for stripes.\n\nIranian women must wear a scarf, but many leave a tuft of hair showing at the forehead.\n\nThat bizarre mixture -- of saber-rattling politics alongside the personal warmth of individual locals -- is what struck me on my recent 12-day trip to Iran to film a public-television show. I found Iran to be perhaps the most misunderstood and fascinating land I've ever visited. And I learned a lot.\n\nThe country is not free. It seems that people -- motivated by fear of Western influences and love of their children -- have forgone democracy for their theocracy. Parents told me, \"We do not want our girls to grow up to be Britney Spears,\" and they are willing to sacrifice some freedom to achieve that goal. They feel their \"revolution of values\" provides an environment where they can raise their children free from the cheap sex, drug abuse and crass materialism of the West.\n\nIranian women must wear a scarf, but many leave a tuft of hair showing at the forehead. After several days, that provocative tuft attracted my eye like cleavage. Making sure that what they can show is as beautiful as possible, Iranian women, per capita, lead the world in nose jobs. Faces are beautifully made up, and -- when so much else is covered -- can be particularly expressive and mysterious. Eye contact is riveting.\n\nBefore arriving in Iran, I was so afraid of anti-Americanism that we had nearly left our big expensive TV camera in Athens and considered flying in with a less obtrusive model. But once there, I found people curious, courteous and quick to smile -- especially when they learned we were American. I've never had such fun with people or found them so chatty than on the streets of Iran.\n\nTehran is modern and bustling, with thriving shopping malls, cars clogging the streets and most people wearing Western-style clothes. Unlike many Muslim capitals, minarets do not dot the skyline, and I barely heard a call to prayer.\n\nAnd yet it's clearly a theocracy. Multiple TV stations broadcast religious programming (along with BBC and CNN) that's perfect for praying -- images of the sun setting on the sea, or the pilgrimage center in Mecca in real-time. In the United States, billboards and ads encourage us to consume, but in Iran, government-sponsored billboards, Muzak and TV programming is all about the teachings of great holy men.\n\nI asked my guide if it's okay to be non-Muslim in Iran. \"Yes,\" he said, \"We have religious freedom, as long as it is not offensive to Islam.\" Christian? \"Sure.\" Jewish? \"Sure.\" Bahai? \"No. We believe that Mohammed -- who came in the 7th century -- was the last prophet, so the Bahai prophet (19th century) is offensive to Islam.\"\n\nI asked, \"What if you want to get somewhere in the military or government?\"\n\nMy guide answered, \"Then you better be a Muslim -- a practicing, Shiite Muslim.\"\n\nEvery film crew stops at the former U.S. Embassy. It was here in 1979 that a gang of revolutionary students stormed what they called the \"Den of Spies\" and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. For Iranians back then, it was a proud moment of triumph against the nation that had meddled in their affairs for years. The embassy wall is still covered with anti-American murals painted at that time. But the hostage crisis was 30 years ago. Most Iranians weren't even born then.

{"question": "When should you take special care?", "answers": ["after a head injury,"], "context": "(CNN) --   Connie and Donald McCracken were watching CNN one evening last week when they learned of the tragic death of actress Natasha Richardson from a head injury. Immediately, their minds turned to their 7-year-old daughter, Morgan, who was upstairs getting ready for bed.\n\n\n\nAn injured Morgan McCracken has benefited from awareness after Natasha Richardson's death.\n\n\n\nTwo days earlier, Morgan, her father, and brother had been playing baseball in the yard of their Mentor, Ohio, home when her father hit a line drive that landed just above Morgan's left temple. A lump formed, but the McCrackens iced it down and the swelling subsided within an hour.\n\n\n\n\"For the next two days, she was perfectly fine,\" Donald McCracken says. \"She had no symptoms. She went to school both days and got an A on her spelling test as usual. There were no issues whatsoever.\"\n\n\n\nBut after hearing about Richardson's death, the McCrackens wondered if Morgan was really as OK as she seemed. After all, Richardson had been talking and lucid immediately after her fatal injury.\n\n\n\nWhen they went upstairs to kiss Morgan good night, she complained of a headache. \"Because of Natasha, we called the pediatrician immediately. And by the time I got off the phone with him, Morgan was sobbing, her head hurt so much,\" McCracken says.\n\n\n\nThe McCrackens took Morgan to the emergency room at LakeWest Hospital in neighboring Willoughby, where doctors ordered a CT scan and immediately put Morgan on a helicopter to Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, with her father by her side.\n\n\n\n\"I knew it was bad when she had to get there by helicopter in six minutes, instead of the 30 minutes it would have taken to get to Cleveland in an ambulance,\" McCracken said.\n\n\n\nWhen the helicopter arrived at Rainbow, the McCrackens were greeted by Dr. Alan Cohen, the hospital's chief of pediatric neurosurgery. He whisked Morgan into the operating room, pausing for a moment to tell McCracken that his daughter had the same injury as Richardson: an epidural hematoma.\n\n\n\nMcCracken remembers standing in the emergency room, feeling like the life had just been sucked out of him. \"My heart sank,\" he says. \"It just sank.\"\n\n\n\nUnlike Richardson's, Morgan's story has a happy ending. After surgery and five days in the hospital, she's at home and doing fine. \"Dr. Cohen told us that if we hadn't brought her in Thursday night, she never would have woken up,\" McCracken says.\n\n\n\nNow the McCrackens sometimes wonder if they waited too long to get Morgan to a doctor. After hearing about Richardson's death, many people are asking themselves the same question: Do all head injuries need attention, even ones that seem minor?\n\n\n\n\"Sometimes there's a gray zone, and there's no right answer,\" Cohen says.  Watch for tips on when to go to the ER »\n\n\n\nIn most cases, it's pretty clear when someone needs medical attention after a head injury, says Greg Ayotte, a spokesperson for the Brain Injury Association of America and a cognitive rehabilitation therapist. \"They're confused, they're agitated, or they might be dizzy or unresponsive,\" he says.\n\n\n\nBut then there's what doctors call the \"talk and die\" scenario, where someone seems fine, only to die hours, or sometimes even days later.\n\n\n\n\"Talk and die\" can happen with several different kinds of brain injuries. In the case of epidural hematomas, the injury Richardson and Morgan had, blood pools in the area between the lining of the brain and the skull. \"Fluid is building up in a contained space, creating pressure. Something's got to give, and that something is the brain,\" Ayotte says. If you don't get to the hospital to have surgery to drain the fluid, \"the deterioration can happen very quickly.\"\n\n\n\nHere, from Ayotte and other experts, is a list of what to do after someone has suffered a head injury.\n\n\n\n1.

Bobby Jindal on Barack Obama: \"I'm certainly not nearly as good of a speaker as he is.\"\n\nJindal gave the Republican response after President Obama's address to Congress last week. Jindal received negative reviews after the speech, and Larry asked him how he felt about that. They also talked about the war of words in the Republican Party centered around Rush Limbaugh.\n\nThe following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity:\n\nLarry King: Governor, you took a lot of flak for that speech. Were you surprised that you did?\n\nGov. Bobby Jindal: Let's be clear, the president is a great speaker -- probably the greatest we've seen in a generation. I'm certainly not nearly as good of a speaker as he is. And I'm not the only one that's got that opinion.\n\nI hope people look at the content of the speech, not just the delivery. You know, for years, I've been told I speak too quickly. Now I'm told I speak too slowly.\n\nWhat's more important is I was outlining a philosophical difference with the stimulus package, with the leadership in Congress, with the administration. I was outlining a philosophical disagreement that says we need to get businesses hiring again. We need to put more money in the private sector.  Watch Larry King's interview with Gov. Bobby Jindal Â»\n\nLet's cut taxes. Let's get rid of the wasteful spending. That's the debate. That's the discussion we need to be having.\n\nKing: But governor, to say that the federal government apparently has no voice in this crisis, when in some cases, they are the only answer, that pointed to a lot of the criticism, didn't it?\n\nJindal: If the president had actually delivered the targeted temporary stimulus package that he described, I think you'd see a lot more conservative and Republican support. We absolutely agree with the kind of infrastructure spending he describes -- speeding up federal spending that would have happened anyway.\n\nLess than 5 percent of this bill was actually [for] the shovel-ready infrastructure spending that he described.  ...\n\nFundamentally, I don't think $30 million for the federal government to buy new cars, $1 billion for the Census, $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts is going to get the economy moving again as quickly as allowing the private sector to create jobs.\n\nKing: There was no criticism of the Bush bailout of the automobile industry. No criticism of the last eight years of the Republican leadership with a tremendous deficit.\n\nJindal: Well, Larry, I think that you're absolutely right. One of the reasons the Republicans lost the elections in 2006 and 2008 is the Republican Party didn't match its actions with its rhetoric. ...\n\nI think one of the reasons we lost elections was that the Republicans came to Washington to change the culture and instead became captive of that culture. The Republican Party defended spending and corruption we never would have accepted from the other side.\n\nKing: Governor, if perception is reality, do you think your speech hurt the party?\n\nJindal: I think that people are going to look at the content. I think people are going to be focused now that we've [got] alternative views on how to move our country forward.\n\nLet me begin the first to say we want to work with the president every chance we can get.

{"question": "What do most recalls involve?", "answers": ["free fixes for the consumer."], "context": "(CNN) -- As Toyota recalls millions of cars, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that an average of 25 percent of U.S. consumers who get recall notices don't follow through and fix their vehicles.\n\n\n\nThe CNN Fact Check Desk wondered: Is there a way to ensure compliance with auto recalls?\n\n\n\nMost vehicle recalls involve free fixes for the consumer.\n\n\n\n• Clarence Ditlow with the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer watchdog group, says there is not a process to ensure that auto owners comply with recalls.\n\n\n\nThe center says vehicle insurers have an incentive and a method to reach car owners who haven't complied fully with recalls. \"Insurers have the VIN [vehicle identification numbers], and they could contact the insured drivers who have failed to comply,\" Ditlow says.\n\n\n\nBecause states are responsible for issuing a vehicle's registration, Ditlow sees an opportunity for state governments to force compliance. He says that states could refuse to renew registration until the manufacturer's fix has been made. However, he says, no states have taken this step so far.\n\n\n\n• According to Edmunds.com, some states do require owners to make the requisite repairs before they attempt to sell the affected car.\n\n\n\n• Jeanne Salvatore, with the Insurance Information Institute, says that auto insurers will pay damage claims caused by the current Toyota defects, then go after Toyota for reimbursements.\n\n\n\n• CNN Personal Finance Editor Gerri Willis says that new car dealers are prevented from selling a defective car.\n\n\n\n• If recall communications are deemed insufficient, the NHTSA can require further efforts from the manufacturer. But there is not a mechanism at the federal level to ensure that drivers comply.\n\n\n\n• Bottom line: If the NHTSA's 25 percent noncompliance figure is any indication, there could be many affected Toyota models that do not get the requisite fix under the current recall. Although there have been suggestions for how to better enforce recalls, there is no mechanism in place to force drivers to make the change.\n\n\n\nCNN's Jen Haley and CNNMoney's Peter Valdes-Dapena contributed to this report.", "parametric_answer": "products", "parametric_answer_freq": 5, "parametric_evidencde": "According to various sources, including the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), most recalls involve:\n\n**Products that pose a risk to consumer safety or health**\n\nRecalls can be triggered by a variety of factors, including defects, contamination, and failure to meet safety standards.

{"question": "What is the name of Gadhafi's son?", "answers": ["Mutassim,"], "context": "Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Doctors completed an autopsy of Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday, with the chief pathologist confirming the former Libyan leader died of a gunshot wound to the head.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Othman el-Zentani would not disclose whether findings revealed if Gadhafi suffered the wound in crossfire or at close-range -- a key question that has prompted the United Nations and international human rights groups to call for an investigation into the final moments of the late Libyan strongman's life.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctors performed the autopsy at a Misrata hospital in the presence of officials from the prosecutor's office, Zentani said. Autopsies were also conducted on the bodies of Gadhafi's son, Mutassim, and his former defense minister, Abu Baker Yunis.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo foreign or independent officials were present, Zentani said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe autopsy report will go to the attorney general's office before it is released to the public, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the three bodies would likely return to a cold storage unit at a Misrata meat market for public viewing, Zentani said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLong lines of people turned up all weekend long to view the corpses.\n\n\n\n\n\nGadhafi's family issued a statement Friday calling on the United Nations and Amnesty International to push Libya's new leadership \"to hand over the bodies of the martyrs of their tribe so they can be buried according to Islamic rites,\" a pro-Gadhafi TV station reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nGadhafi's death Thursday solidified the power of the National Transitional Council, which marked the country's liberation on Sunday in the eastern city of Benghazi, where the uprising started.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut uncertainty was still swirling Sunday about the death of the Libyan leader, who Libyan and world powers wanted to capture and prosecute for war crimes.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaders of Libya's interim government have said Gadhafi was killed in crossfire after fighters captured him Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut others have questioned that account.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Bouckaert, Human Rights Watch's emergencies director, told CNN that fighting had ended when Gadhafi was cornered in a drainage ditch.

{"question": "What may be telling people all about you?", "answers": ["their cars"], "context": "(AOL Autos) -- Since there have been cars, people have chosen their rides based on what their cars say about them. AOL Autos put a list of cars before automotive industry experts to capture their take on several popular cars.\n\n\n\nDrivers of the dependable Camry know what's important in life, says expert.\n\n\n\nOur panel consisted of Stephanie Brinley, senior manager at Auto Pacific; James Bell, editor and publisher of IntelliChoice and Jim Markwalder, veteran automotive consultant from Detroit. Rest assured, these experts did not pull any punches.\n\n\n\nToyota Prius: Green no matter its color\n\n\n\nBrinley looked through the company's vast data on the Toyota Prius .\n\n\n\n\"Buying a Prius shows the world that you love the environment and hate using fuel,\" said Brinley. \"Compared to the overall industry, Prius buyers are more often women, have fewer kids and more often have college educations.\"\n\n\n\nBell adds, \"New Prius buyers want to be part of the 'green' club.\"\n\n\n\n\"Prius drivers like the video-game challenge of continuously trying to best your own fuel economy achievements,\" said Brinley. Markwalder opines: \"There's a good chance that if you come upon a line of slow moving traffic, a Prius driver will be at the front of the line, self-righteously driving under the speed limit on his or her way to save the world.\" We're just quoting here, folks.\n\n\n\nChevrolet Corvette: Performer for the mid-life crisis\n\n\n\nThe Chevy Corvette \"seems to be more often a reward car. Its buyers are older than the industry average, with 88 percent born before 1946, according to Auto Pacific data. Only 11 percent of Corvette owners are in Gen Y or Gen X.\" Bell adds: \"Sadly, the usual stereotype of the Corvette buyer as a 57-year old male deep in a mid-life crisis is proven.\"\n\n\n\nBetter car than its image suggests\n\n\n\nBell sees another side to the Corvette. \"It is the absolute greatest performance bargain on the planet,\" said Bell. \"It's an affordable giant-killer.\"\n\n\n\nMarkwalder adds, \"There have been 1.5 million Corvettes produced since 1953, and while plenty of old guys drive them, they are an engineering marvel that will run 180 mph or return 30+ mpg highway fuel economy.\"\n\n\n\nToyota Camry: A major transportation appliance\n\n\n\n\"I think the Camry gets a bad rap for being the 'microwave oven' of the car industry,\" said Bell. \"It's boring, reliable, efficient, and common. But to many drivers, these words are exactly all they are looking for, making the Camry their own personal rock star. A Toyota Camry in the driveway tells everyone that you know what is important in life, and it's not your car.\"\n\n\n\nDodge Challenger: The transcendent pony car\n\n\n\nThe Dodge Challenger looks more like its original than the 2010 Ford Mustang or Chevrolet Camaro. According to Brinley, the Challenger appeals to Baby Boomers who like styling and power. But almost 30 percent of Challenger buyers are Gen X or Gen Y. Surprisingly, this beats out the Prius, a more forward-looking vehicle; only 18-percent of its buyers are Gen X or Y.\n\n\n\nAuto Pacific's data shows that the Dodge Challenger is winning buyers too young to remember the original 1970-74 Challenger. \"All ages stop and stare at this car,\" said Bell. \"Especially when it's in Hemi Orange, from old-skool Hot Rodders to the Import Tuner crowd.\" This wide appeal makes pegging the Challenger owner more challenging.\n\n\n\nFord F-150: Working man's truck\n\n\n\nAccording to Auto Pacific data, the driver of a Ford F-150 work truck (a plain, regular-cab model), is an employed man. Markwalder confirms with this: \"Basic Ford trucks, like the XLT, make a good tool for the guy who works hard for an honest living.\" Bell adds, \"We'll see fewer non-work trucks because using them for commuting has lost its shine.\"\n\n\n\nMercedes-Benz R-Class:", "parametric_answer": "social media", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "Your social media profiles!"}

{"question": "What did Obama say about troops?", "answers": ["to Afghanistan is part of a strategy to reverse the Taliban's momentum and stabilize the country's government."], "context": "West Point, New York (CNN) -- President Obama said Tuesday that the deployment of 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan is part of a strategy to reverse the Taliban's momentum and stabilize the country's government.\n\n\n\n\"There is no imminent threat of the government being overthrown, but the Taliban has gained momentum,\" Obama said at the U.S. Military Academy. \"Al Qaeda has not re-emerged in Afghanistan in the same numbers as before 9/11, but they retain their safe-havens along the border.\n\n\n\n\"And our forces lack the full support they need to effectively train and partner with Afghan security forces and better secure the population. ... In short, the status quo is not sustainable.\"\n\n\n\nObama said he'd begin sending the additional troops \"at the fastest pace possible\" starting in early 2010 \"with a goal of starting to withdraw forces from the country in July 2011.\"\n\n\n\nThe president said additional U.S. forces bolstered by NATO troops \"will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces.\"\n\n\n\nSenior administration officials said Tuesday that Obama has a goal of withdrawing most U.S. forces by the end of his current term, which ends in January 2013.\n\n\n\nWatch what the new troops will do in Afghanistan\n\n\n\nIt will be the second increase of U.S. forces in the war-torn Islamic country ordered by Obama since he took office in January.\n\n\n\nIn his speech Tuesday, Obama said his strategy had three objectives:\n\n\n\n• Deny al Qaeda a safe haven\n\n\n\n• Reverse the Taliban's momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow Afghanistan's government\n\n\n\n• Strengthen Afghanistan's security forces and government\n\n\n\nThe additional troops was one way to achieve these, he said. Other strategies will include holding Afghan government leaders accountable for corruption, focus assistance on areas that could help the lives of Afghans, and securing the country's border with Pakistan.\n\n\n\n\"We are in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country. But this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan. That is why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border,\" Obama said.\n\n\n\nThe president said he rejected the option of committing more forces for an undefined mission of nation-building without any deadlines.\n\n\n\n\"I reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what we can achieve at a reasonable cost, and what we need to achieve to secure our interests,\" Obama said. \"Furthermore, the absence of a timeframe for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government. It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security, and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan.\"\n\n\n\nObama rejected analogies with the war in Vietnam that divided America in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n\n\n\"Unlike Vietnam, we are joined by a broad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action,\" Obama said. \"Unlike Vietnam, we are not facing a broad-based popular insurgency. And most importantly, unlike Vietnam, the American people were viciously attacked from Afghanistan, and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border.\"\n\n\n\nObama said the U.S. has no interest in occupying Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\"We will support efforts by the Afghan government to open the door to those Taliban who abandon violence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens,\" Obama said. \"And we will seek a partnership with Afghanistan grounded in mutual respect -- to isolate those who destroy; to strengthen those who build; to hasten the day when our troops will leave; and to forge a lasting friendship in which America is your partner, and never your patron.\"\n\n\n\nObama spoke to an audience of West Point cadets, staff and guests in outlining his strategy that he has deliberated for months, meeting several times with his national security team.\n\n\n\nHe recognized that some in the audience had fought in Afghanistan, and some would be deployed in the future.\n\n\n\n\"As your commander in chief, I owe you a mission that is clearly defined, and worthy of", "parametric_answer": "were leaving", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "Based on the semantic similarity of the provided answers, the grouping can be summarized as follows:\n\n1.

Will you be able to continue that?\n\n\n\nMark Fields: Well, our position hasn't changed. We're in a different position than some of our competitors, and we're not seeking emergency taxpayer assistance.\n\n\n\nChetry: Right, but I'm saying in the future, how are you guys guaranteeing that you won't need to go to the federal government like your two competitors have and ask for some help?\n\n\n\nFields: Well, we're going to continue executing our plan, which really involves decisive actions around transforming the business, but also bringing great high-quality, fuel-efficient vehicles into the marketplace.

The good news is, our new cars and trucks that are coming into the marketplace are being well-received. Our retail market share has been up three of the last four months. We expect the month of March our retail share to be up again.\n\n\n\nBut getting that consumer confidence is really important.

Chrysler a month, basically, to submit a reorganization plan that the administration finds acceptable. The Obama administration also of course forced General Motors CEO Rick Wagoner out.

{"question": "whom did they team up with", "answers": ["ClimateCare, one of Europe's most experienced providers of carbon offsets,"], "context": "During CNN's \"Going Green: Green Light for Business\" coverage, we've asked businesses to tell us how they balance the imperative for profit with environmental concerns. Jonathan Breeze, the CEO of Jet Republic, tells CNN how he's working to create a carbon neutral airline.\n\n\n\nLONDON, England -- The aviation industry is often perceived as one of the bad guys in the climate change debate. As a mode of transport, flying is regarded as being particularly polluting because of the amount of fuel used at high altitude. And, it is estimated to be responsible for around 3.5 percent of global greenhouse emissions.\n\n\n\nJet Republic CEO Jonathan Breeze says it would be a mistake to let green initiatives in the airline industry fall by the wayside.\n\n\n\nThe sector's reputation was damaged further when it was excluded from the targets outlined in the Kyoto agreement, which was interpreted by some as an example of its disregard for the climate change issue.\n\n\n\nThis is unfair because the industry has taken great strides to reduce its environmental impact. For example, over the last 30 years, it has achieved a 60 percent improvement in fuel efficiency.\n\n\n\nThere is a great deal of research being undertaken by manufacturers into more efficient technologies and alternative fuels, while the Single European Sky initiative aims to improve flight planning across Europe to rationalize the amount of time an aircraft is in the sky.\n\n\n\nPractically everything we do in our everyday lives has a carbon cost attached to it, but aviation is an element that we believe has come in for an undue level of criticism, when in fact it is arguably working harder than most industries to address the issue of climate change.\n\n\n\nThe reaction to this criticism from governments has been taxation. But making a special case of aviation fails to address the wider issues.\n\n\n\nAviation fuel is carbon taxed, but why is this tax not applied on other types of fuel such as electricity and gas? The additional revenue that would be generated could be ploughed back into green energy schemes and help deliver heightened efficiencies that our industry is already investigating.\n\n\n\nPunitive taxation, which is driving up the cost of air travel, will ultimately end up being absorbed by the operator or by passengers. This, coupled with the current economic downturn, represents a significant threat to progress in the aviation industry as it could lead to a stifling of innovation and development.\n\n\n\nMeeting the challenge of climate change costs money -- modernizing fleets with more efficient aircraft comes at a price. As an industry which has been hit hard by the downturn, some of these initiatives could fall by the wayside. To allow this to happen would be a grave mistake.\n\n\n\nWe identified climate change as one area where we wanted to set the standard in the industry, and as a new entrant to the market we have been able to build a commitment to carbon neutrality into the heart of our business operations. It was a consideration in our choice of the Learjet 60 XR as the model of aircraft in our 110 strong fleet.\n\n\n\nThe 60 XR is the most fuel-efficient midsize aircraft in the world, something it achieves by being built with light and strong modern materials, and flying higher and faster than other aircraft. It's a perfect example of a win-win solution. We burn less fuel; our customers enjoy lower pricing.\n\n\n\nAircraft positioning is another important consideration that has an impact on the amount of fuel consumed; our fleet is based all across Europe, to reflect where our clients are. The positions of our aircraft are carefully planned and managed so that the number of \"over flights\" -- that is legs where the aircraft is empty -- are kept to an absolute minimum.\n\n\n\nWe wanted to be 100 percent carbon neutral from launch so we partnered with ClimateCare, one of Europe's most experienced providers of carbon offsets, where each project is rigorously audited and monitored for quality. By comparison, under the European emissions trading scheme, which doesn't take effect until 2012, commercial airlines will only have to offset 15 percent of the carbon emissions they create.\n\n\n\nWith the impact of aviation on climate change being widely reported, people are more conscious than ever about", "parametric_answer": "avengers", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm happy to help!

The Corps of Engineers, on its Web site, says a miter gate \"has two leaves that provide a closure at one end of the lock.\" They are so named because the two leaves meet at an angle pointing upstream and resembling a miter joint, the Web site said, referring to a joint meeting at a 45-degree angle, such as the corner of a picture frame.\n\n\n\nA public policy organization, in a February 2008 report, graded the locks' performance as a D, \"based primarily upon risk of failure due to unreliability of miter gates.\"\n\n\n\nThe federal government allocated $10.6 million to install new chamber miter gates, according to Waterways Council Inc., which describes itself as an organization \"advocating a modern and well-maintained national system of ports and inland waterways.\"\n\n\n\nHornback said the work was scheduled for 2011, adding that it's unclear whether Sunday's break will speed that up.\n\n\n\n\"The risk is very high that a failure of the lock gates will occur, forcing traffic through the auxiliary lock for an extended period, causing huge delays and costs to the towing industry,\" the council said in the report last year.\n\n\n\nEngineers hope to have the river back open as soon as possible, Hornback said, but an exact time frame was not known.\n\n\n\nSome 55 million tons of commodities pass through the Markland Locks each year, according to the Waterways Council.

But a source with detailed knowledge of the former president's movements told CNN late Monday that Clinton was going to seek the release of Laura Ling and Euna Lee, both reporters for California-based Current TV -- media venture launched by Clinton's former vice president, Al Gore.\n\n\n\nMeeting Clinton were the vice president of North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly, Yang Hyong Sop, and Kim Kye Gwan, the vice foreign minister, KCNA reported, adding that \"a little girl presented a bouquet to Bill Clinton.\"\n\n\n\nThe women were arrested while reporting on the border between North Korea and China and sentenced in June to 12 years in prison on charges of entering the country illegally to conduct a smear campaign.\n\n\n\nSince the United States has no diplomatic relations with North Korea, efforts to resolve the issue so far have been handled through Sweden, which represents U.S. interests in the reclusive communist state.  Watch what may lie behind the pick of Bill Clinton »\n\n\n\nLast month, Clinton's wife -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- said the Obama administration had dropped its request for Ling and Lee to be released on humanitarian grounds and instead was seeking amnesty, which implies forgiveness for an offense.\n\n\n\nThis change in language is an important distinction that could move North Korea to release the women without feeling that its legal system has been slighted, according to analyst Mike Chinoy.\n\n\n\n\"I suspect that it was made pretty clear in advance that Bill Clinton would be able to return with these two women otherwise it would be a terrible loss of face for him,\" said Chinoy, an Edgerton Senior Fellow on Asia at the Pacific Council on International Policy in Los Angeles. \"The bigger, broader and more important question is what else could be on the agenda. Will Clinton be carrying a letter from Barack Obama for the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il? Will he meet Kim Jong Il?\"\n\n\n\nClinton's mission comes as the United States and its allies in the region are trying to push North Korea back into stalled nuclear disarmament talks.

North Korea agreed at that time to halt the development of nuclear weapons, but abandoned that accord and withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003.\n\n\n\nClinton had considered visiting North Korea in 2000 near the end of his second term as president.

{"question": "Who pioneered inventions?", "answers": ["Jobs"], "context": "(CNN) -- During a 1996 interview with television talk show host Charlie Rose, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs took exception to Rose's characterization of him as \"a guy who founds high-tech companies and tries to make another billion.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, well, I don't think of myself that way,\" Jobs said. \"The things that I have done in my life, I think the things we do now at Pixar [the animation company he bought in 1986], these are team sports. They are not something one person does.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIf pop culture were a team sport, Jobs would have certainly played quarterback.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the invention of iTunes, which completely changed the business of music, to offering the world its first completely full-length computer-generated animated film with Pixar's \"Toy Story\" in 1995, Jobs left his indelible fingerprints on the entertainment industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other \"toys\" he helped create like the iPod, iPhone and iPad not only changed the way the world consumed media, but also inserted both Jobs and Apple firmly into the entertainment zeitgeist. Even the commercials, from the 1984, George Orwell-inspired Super Bowl Macintosh ad to the more recent \"Are you a Mac or a PC,\" were uber-cool.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Jobs has been more well known and hailed for his innovation with high-tech, he also made some power moves which forever changed Hollywood. And in what sounds like a fantasy dreamed up by the geek gods, it all began with George Lucas.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Jobs explained to the news program \"60 Minutes\" in 2003, when Lucas was creating \"Star Wars\" he reasoned that digital copy of his film would be clearer and cleaner than analog. The computer graphics division of his Lucasfilm company, which honed the technology behind the process, would go on to become Pixar Animation Studios after Jobs bought it for $10 million in 1986.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs chairman and chief executive officer of Pixar, Jobs led the way in marrying the endless possibilities of technology with the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe world hadn't even heard of computer-generated imagery (CGI) in 1991 when Pixar struck a deal with Walt Disney Studios to develop and distribute three full-length animated films. The first of these, \"Toy Story,\" captured audience's hearts with its tale of the adventures of a group of children's toys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Toy Story\" went on to become the top-earning film of that year, grossing $192 million in domestic box office receipts and $362 million worldwide. It spurred two sequels, theme park attractions and an extensive line of merchandise.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was followed by films like \"A Bug's Life,\" \"Monster's Inc.,\" \"Finding Nemo,\" and \"The Incredibles,\" the last two of which won Academy Awards for best animated feature. Jobs sold Pixar to Disney in 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy then he was firmly back in the driver's seat as the chief executive officer of Apple, which was setting the world afire with its inventions.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of his biggest launches was in 2003 with the iTunes Music Store, which revolutionized the world of music downloads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Other companies sold digital music before Apple,\" said Bill Werde, editorial director of Billboard, said in a statement. \"Other companies made digital music available on computers and digital phones and used it in commercials. Apple's brilliance -- and I don't think anyone doubts that this was Steve Jobs' brilliance -- was that Apple made it exciting and simple and effortless and fun.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJobs was a major influence on portable media, which paved the way for gamers to be able to engage in their favorite past time via handheld devices and film fans to be able to stream movies almost anywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe introduction of the 99-cent single meant music lovers no longer had to purchase an entire album to selectively enjoy their favorite tunes.

They are not something one person does.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIf pop culture were a team sport, Jobs would have certainly played quarterback.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the invention of iTunes, which completely changed the business of music, to offering the world its first completely full-length computer-generated animated film with Pixar's \"Toy Story\" in 1995, Jobs left his indelible fingerprints on the entertainment industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other \"toys\" he helped create like the iPod, iPhone and iPad not only changed the way the world consumed media, but also inserted both Jobs and Apple firmly into the entertainment zeitgeist. Even the commercials, from the 1984, George Orwell-inspired Super Bowl Macintosh ad to the more recent \"Are you a Mac or a PC,\" were uber-cool.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Jobs has been more well known and hailed for his innovation with high-tech, he also made some power moves which forever changed Hollywood. And in what sounds like a fantasy dreamed up by the geek gods, it all began with George Lucas.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Jobs explained to the news program \"60 Minutes\" in 2003, when Lucas was creating \"Star Wars\" he reasoned that digital copy of his film would be clearer and cleaner than analog. The computer graphics division of his Lucasfilm company, which honed the technology behind the process, would go on to become Pixar Animation Studios after Jobs bought it for $10 million in 1986.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs chairman and chief executive officer of Pixar, Jobs led the way in marrying the endless possibilities of technology with the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe world hadn't even heard of computer-generated imagery (CGI) in 1991 when Pixar struck a deal with Walt Disney Studios to develop and distribute three full-length animated films. The first of these, \"Toy Story,\" captured audience's hearts with its tale of the adventures of a group of children's toys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Toy Story\" went on to become the top-earning film of that year, grossing $192 million in domestic box office receipts and $362 million worldwide. It spurred two sequels, theme park attractions and an extensive line of merchandise.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was followed by films like \"A Bug's Life,\" \"Monster's Inc.,\" \"Finding Nemo,\" and \"The Incredibles,\" the last two of which won Academy Awards for best animated feature. Jobs sold Pixar to Disney in 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy then he was firmly back in the driver's seat as the chief executive officer of Apple, which was setting the world afire with its inventions.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of his biggest launches was in 2003 with the iTunes Music Store, which revolutionized the world of music downloads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Other companies sold digital music before Apple,\" said Bill Werde, editorial director of Billboard, said in a statement. \"Other companies made digital music available on computers and digital phones and used it in commercials. Apple's brilliance -- and I don't think anyone doubts that this was Steve Jobs' brilliance -- was that Apple made it exciting and simple and effortless and fun.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJobs was a major influence on portable media, which paved the way for gamers to be able to engage in their favorite past time via handheld devices and film fans to be able to stream movies almost anywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe introduction of the 99-cent single meant music lovers no longer had to purchase an entire album to selectively enjoy their favorite tunes. The ability of the iPod, and later the iPhone and iPad, to hold thousands of songs also meant that fans never had to be far from their tunes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"", "parametric_answer": "changed world", "parametric_answer_freq": 5, "parametric_evidencde": "Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, was not typically known for inventing products himself, but rather for transforming existing technologies into innovative, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing products.

When he wanted elaborate ceilings salvaged from Europe, Morgan expanded their reach to fit into the estate's rooms.\n\n\n\nA massive 95 x 104-foot outdoor swimming pool, made of concrete and Vermont marble, is one of the central jewels of the property.\n\n\n\nOur guide recounted Hearst house rules. In an effort to control his guests' alcohol consumption, Hearst banned them from bringing their own liquor. The Hollywood types reportedly snuck it in anyway, like frat boys at a football game.\n\n\n\nGuests stayed in opulent guest houses adorned with religious icons, art and other worldly treasures.\n\n\n\nHearst mandated unmarried guests sleep apart, while violating his own edict by sleeping with his beloved actress friend Marion Davies. Though Hearst remained married to Millicent Hearst, with whom he had five children, Davies' ghost is everywhere at Hearst Castle.\n\n\n\nImages of the actress, along with Charlie Chaplin and others stars, flicker about in a short film shown in the mansion's 50-seat movie theater.\n\n\n\nMuseum-worthy pieces fill the property, including intricate Flemish tapestries in an east-facing sitting room called the Morning Room.\n\n\n\nOwing to my Belgian roots, I looked at the tapestries and cracked to my kids, \"No wonder my 83-year-old mother can still sew a tiny patch onto a Girl Scout vest.\"\n\n\n\nThe castle's grandeur was enough to hold the childrens' attention. We saw them as young as 4 years old, eyes popping while taking in ancient Egyptian statues or towering Christmas trees.\n\n\n\n\"This guy was rich!\" my friend's 7-year-old-son, Nicolas, exclaimed.\n\n\n\nPerhaps a headline from Hearst's San Francisco Examiner in another era could best describe our trip:\n\n\n\n\"The road to fun is back and affordable!\"", "parametric_answer": "howard hughes", "parametric_answer_freq": 5, "parametric_evidencde": "Howard Hughes entertained Hollywood stars at his estate, known as the Beverly Hills Mansion, in the 1940s and 1950s."}

{"question": "Who has been fired?", "answers": ["Elizabeth Birnbaum"], "context": "Washington (CNN) -- Minerals Management Service Director Elizabeth Birnbaum has been fired, according to two CNN sources.\n\n\n\n\n\nA senior administration official has told CNN that an official announcement will be made during President Barack Obama's news conference scheduled for Thursday afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decision to fire Birnbaum comes in the wake of a recently released report highlighting what many observers have characterized as widespread corruption at the Minerals Management Service (MMS), which is part of the Interior Department.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe period covered by the report was prior to the April explosion in the Gulf of Mexico that sank the oil rig Deepwater Horizon, resulting in a massive oil spill that well owner BP and federal authorities are still trying to cap.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong other things, the report, issued by the Interior Department's inspector general, revealed that federal inspectors overseeing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico accepted meals and tickets to sporting events from companies they monitored.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one case, an inspector in the MMS office in Lake Charles, Louisiana, conducted inspections of four offshore platforms while negotiating a job with the company, the report stated.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lake Charles investigation was launched shortly after another scandal emerged from within the MMS. A September 2008 inspector general's report found regulators in the agency's Colorado office received improper gifts from energy industry representatives and engaged in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations with them.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterior Secretary Ken Salazar recently called the allegations of MMS corruption \"evidence of the cozy relationship between some elements of [the agency] and the oil and gas industry.\"  He pledged to follow through with the Interior Department inspector general's recommendations, \"including taking any and all appropriate personnel actions including termination, discipline and referrals of any wrongdoing for criminal prosecution.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSalazar insisted Thursday in testimony before a House subcommittee, however, that Birnbaum had resigned \"on her own terms and own volition.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe \"is a strong and very effective person who, among other things, helped us break through the very difficult things which we have a lot more work to do,\" Salazar said. \"She helped us with addressing a very broken system. And all I can really [say] is that she is a good public servant.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMMS collected nearly $10 billion in royalties from the energy and mining industries in 2009. Salazar recently announced that he was splitting up the agency to separate its energy development, enforcement and revenue collection divisions, saying they have \"conflicting missions\" that needed to be separated.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe associate director for the agency's Offshore Minerals Management Program is leaving at the end of May, a month earlier than planned, in the wake of the Gulf spill. That official, Chris Oynes, launched the investigation that resulted in former New Orleans, Louisiana, supervisor Donald Howard's firing in 2007. Howard later pleaded guilty after being accused of failing to report gifts valued  at more than $6,600 from an offshore drilling contractor.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the growing push to crack down on the MMS, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, introduced legislation Wednesday requiring federal oil industry regulators to wait at least two years after leaving government service before going to work for companies they helped regulate.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong other things, the bill would bar regulators from accepting gifts from oil companies. It also would require regulators to divest themselves of any stock they may currently hold in oil companies, and prohibit regulators from part-time employment in the industry.", "parametric_answer": "james comey", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm not aware of any recent information about someone being fired.

{"question": "What did Brown want for her children?", "answers": ["\"to give my kids a better environment.\""], "context": "ROOSEVELT, New York (CNN) -- When Lisa Brown moved into her rental house on Long Island last summer with her three daughters, she says, it felt like a new beginning.\n\n\n\nLisa Brown has to move out of her rental house because it is facing foreclosure\n\n\n\nAfter living in apartments, the spacious house got her attention immediately. \"It was bigger than what I had lived in,\" she says. Brown was also won over by the neighborhood with its tidy homes and good school district. \"I wanted to come here, and I wanted to see my kids graduate from this school district.\"\n\n\n\nBut they hardly had a chance. Instead, fighting back tears, she says, \"I have to get out.\"\n\n\n\nBrown and her family are being evicted not because of anything they did, but because her landlord defaulted on the mortgage and the house fell into foreclosure. The house was recently sold at auction.\n\n\n\nThe bad news came just seven months after Brown had moved in. A real estate broker came to the door and handed her an eviction notice, telling her she had 30 days to vacate. \"I was hysterical, I was like, what do you mean?\"\n\n\n\nWatch Lisa Brown's talk about why she has to move »  The broker explained that the landlord no longer owns the property and that the lease was no longer valid. Brown had no idea the house was in foreclosure.  As a tenant, she always paid her rent on time, and she assumed the rent was going toward the mortgage.\n\n\n\n\"I didn't see there was a problem,\" she said. \"You know, I'm paying rent, and she's putting it toward her mortgage, I didn't see the problem.\"\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Brown is not the only tenant caught off guard. According to the Center for Housing Policy, nearly 20 percent of all foreclosures are on rental properties, and tenants' rights in such situations are minimal.   In most states, when a bank forecloses on a landlord, the tenant has no guarantee of being allowed to stay in the property, and neither the bank nor the landlord has a legal obligation to tell the tenant about the foreclosure. So while the owners know what's going on, renters are usually kept in the dark.\n\n\n\nNew York State Sen. Jeff Klein is aware that renters can run into problems. \"In many instances, they're actually paying their rent on time, and the owner of the property who is in foreclosure is pocketing the money,\" he says.\n\n\n\nKlein says rental properties are involved in 50 percent of all foreclosures in New York, and he is working on a law to warn renters of foreclosure proceedings ahead of time and to keep them from losing their security deposit and being evicted with nowhere to go.\n\n\n\nSimilar laws are already in place in Ohio, Illinois, Minnesota, Maryland, Rhode Island, Michigan and California. \"What we're facing here\", Klein says, \"is sort of the new homeless population unless we do something about it.\"\n\n\n\nBrown was astonished to learn that her landlord rented her the house when she knew she was losing it. \"She knew that this house was foreclosing on her.

{"question": "What did the firefighters claim?", "answers": ["reverse discrimination"], "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- New Haven, Connecticut, firefighter Frank Ricci, the lead plaintiff in perhaps the most controversial case involving Judge Sonia Sotomayor, said Thursday that Sotomayor's rejection of his reverse discrimination claim had undermined the concept of a merit-based civil service system.\n\n\n\nNew Haven firefighter Frank Ricci sued after the city threw out results of a 2003 firefighter promotion exam.\n\n\n\nRicci was one of a group of 20 mostly white firefighters who sued the city of New Haven after it threw out the results of a 2003 firefighter promotion exam because almost no minorities qualified for promotions.\n\n\n\nThe 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, including Sotomayor, backed the city in the 2008 case Ricci v. DeStefano. The ruling of the Circuit Court was overturned in June by a 5-4 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nThe \"belief that citizens should be reduced to racial statistics is flawed,\" Ricci told the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n\n\n\"It only divides people who don't wish to be divided along racial lines. The very reason we have civil service rules is to root out politics, discrimination and nepotism. Our case demonstrates that these ills will exist if the rules of merit and the law are not followed.\"  Watch firefighters testify »\n\n\n\nRicci also criticized Sotomayor's 2nd Circuit for disposing of the case in an \"unsigned, unpublished summary order that consisted of a single paragraph.\"\n\n\n\nSotomayor was not present when Ricci spoke. She left the session after concluding her remarks earlier Thursday.\n\n\n\nSotomayor argued before committee members Tuesday that her ruling in the Ricci case was decided on the basis of \"a very thorough, 78-page decision by the district court\" and followed an established precedent.\n\n\n\n\"This was not a quota case or (an) affirmative action case,\" she said. The case was a challenge to a firefighter test that had a wide range of difference between the pass and failure rate of different groups. The city of New Haven, she noted, was at risk of being sued by employees who could show they were \"disparately impacted\" by the test.\n\n\n\nNew Haven city officials, after a number of days of hearings, decided they wouldn't certify the test but would instead attempt to develop a test of equal value in measuring a candidate's qualifications without having a disparate impact, she said.\n\n\n\nThe question before the 2nd Circuit, Sotomayor said, was whether the city's decision was based on race or its understanding of what the law required it to do. The Circuit Court ruled that it was based on the latter.\n\n\n\nBased on established legal precedent, the 2nd Circuit decided that the city's decision was proper under established law. The Supreme Court, however, applied a new standard, she said, based on a different area of law. If she were ruling on that case today, she said, she would be bound by the new standards set by the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nRicci was one of several witnesses who testified both for and against Sotomayor.\n\n\n\nLinda Chavez, head of the conservative Center for Equal Opportunity, which opposes affirmative action, argued that \"it is clear\" from Sotomayor's record \"that she has drunk deep from the well of identity politics.\" It is impossible for Sotomayor to be a fair judge when she has \"shown a willingness to let her policy preferences guide her,\" Chavez said.\n\n\n\nArkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel testified on Sotomayor's behalf, arguing that her opinion in the Ricci case was, in fact, an example of judicial restraint. It followed a string of legal precedents dating back almost three decades, he said.\n\n\n\nNew York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg also testified in favor of Sotomayor, telling committee members that she is an \"independent jurist\" with a \"sharp and agile mind\" who would bring \"a wealth of unique experience\" to the high court.", "parametric_answer": "they claimed arson", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "\"I'm happy to help!

{"question": "When will the panel's final report be released?", "answers": ["next week.)"], "context": "Editor's note: Madeleine K. Albright is former U.S. secretary of state. William S. Cohen is former U.S. secretary of defense. They are co-chairs of the Genocide Prevention Task Force.\n\n\n\nMadeleine K. Albright served as secretary of state under President Bill Clinton.\n\n\n\n(CNN) -- In this age of electronic media communications, Americans are increasingly confronted in their living rooms -- and even on their cell phones -- with information about and images of genocide and mass atrocities virtually anywhere they occur.\n\n\n\nThis instantaneous media communication has sensitized many Americans to the suffering of people in all corners of the globe. The Internet has proved to be a powerful tool for organizing broad-based responses to genocide and mass atrocities, as we have seen in response to the crisis in Darfur.\n\n\n\nWith all of this information written and broadcast about the horrors of genocide and mass atrocities around the world, why do they continue? And as public citizens, public officials and policymakers, how can we prevent this horrendous crime that assaults our humanitarian values and threatens our national security?\n\n\n\nLast year, we agreed to co-chair the Genocide Prevention Task Force, which was jointly convened by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, The American Academy of Diplomacy and the United States Institute of Peace. (The final report is to be released next week.)\n\n\n\nThe idea for the task force arose out of a desire by each of these institutions to reach beyond their individual capabilities and build a practical framework that could help the U.S. government better respond to threats of genocide and mass atrocities. Our challenge was to match words to deeds and stop allowing the unacceptable. That task is in fact one of the most persistent puzzles of our times.\n\n\n\nMany people ask: Why do genocides and mass atrocities happen?\n\n\n\nThere is no consensus as to the causes of genocide and mass atrocities, nor is there one commonly agreed-upon theory that explains the key catalysts, motivations or mechanisms that lead to them. History has shown that genocide and mass atrocities manifest themselves in highly variable ways, and we should not assume that future perpetrators will follow old patterns.\n\n\n\nHowever, there are warning signs. Genocide is not the inevitable result of \"ancient hatreds\" or irrational leaders. It requires planning and is carried out systematically. But that fact also means that there are ways to recognize its signs and symptoms, and viable options to prevent it at every turn, if we are committed and prepared.\n\n\n\nOur report recommends a number of distinct but interrelated areas where the United States government can develop and deploy more effective strategies to identify and pursue opportunities for prevention of genocide and mass atrocities:\n\n\n\nFirst, we believe that leadership is an indispensable ingredient. Nothing is more central to preventing genocide than leadership -- from the president, Congress and the American people. Making progress requires leaders to summon political will not only after a crisis strikes, but also before one emerges.\n\n\n\nSecond is the importance of early warning. It is critical for policymakers to have good analysis of areas where there is a high risk of genocide or organized violence in order to design effective strategies and spur action. By improving the accuracy of warnings, we will find greater opportunities for preventive action.\n\n\n\nEarly prevention can avert a crisis. Many countries are vulnerable to extreme violence. By engaging leaders, institutions and civil society at an early stage, the United States can help countries steer clear of these dangers.\n\n\n\nPreventive diplomacy is critical to halt and reverse escalation. Even when signs of preparation for genocide are apparent, there are opportunities to alter leaders' decisions and interrupt their plans. By improving our crisis response system, we will be better prepared to mount coherent, carefully calibrated and timely preventive diplomatic strategies.\n\n\n\nA willingness to utilize military options to stop ongoing atrocities when prevention efforts have failed is crucial. U.S. military assets can also play an important role in supporting and providing credibility to options short of the use of force, including by deterring violence through military presence or threat.\n\n\n\nLastly, we cite the power of international action. The United States has an interest in promoting a system of international norms and institutions that averts potential genocide and", "parametric_answer": "soon", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "I apologize, but I don't have any information about a specific panel or report.

The rising tension raised questions about the ability of the Haitian National Police to maintain order and its tactics in doing so.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the United States is sending thousands of troops to assist in relief efforts, U.S. officials say the Haitian police are responsible for security on the streets, with backing from U.N. peacekeepers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The first line of law and order here is, number one, the Haitian police, number two, the U.N. forces,\" U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Merten said Monday. \"The U.S. forces are standing by to provide security as needed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat seems to be an overwhelming task for the Haitian National Police (HNP), a force of about 9,000 that is the impoverished Caribbean nation's lone security apparatus.\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest updates | Full coverage\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Police Chief Mario Andresol told CNN Monday that the department has been severely affected by the earthquake, with thousands of officers injured, killed or unaccounted for.

{"question": "Which airlines plane was involved?", "answers": ["Air France"], "context": "(CNN) -- There is a region of the world where the weather is always hot and humid and it rains almost every day of the year. Sounds predictable, right? But weather in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, or ITCZ, can be volatile and dangerous.\n\n\n\nAir France Flight 447 went down in a volatile zone along the equator between South America and Africa.\n\n\n\nThe Intertropical Convergence Zone, which circles the Earth near the equator, is where officials say Air France Flight 447 plunged into the Atlantic Ocean. While weather has not been cited as a reason for the plane's crash, the tragedy does call attention to the region.\n\n\n\nThe ITCZ is a belt of low pressure that wraps around the planet. Clouds and storms form along it because it is literally where the winds of the world's hemispheres meet.\n\n\n\nHigh pressure in the Northern Hemisphere churns air from the northeast toward the equator. On the flip side, air is steered from the southeast by high pressure in the Southern Hemisphere. The winds that move this air toward the equator are also known as \"trade winds\" and converge in the middle of the tropics. That's where the Intertropical Convergence Zone name comes from.\n\n\n\nHere, air and water temperatures are typically in the mid-80s. The warm, moist air is heated further by the blazing tropical sun. Steamy air, coming off the ocean, rises until it hits cooler, drier air aloft, forming clouds and thunderstorms. These gigantic storms contain volatile updrafts and downdrafts that can move at speeds of 100 mph.\n\n\n\nThe height of these storms also can tower to more than 10 miles in the air. Even if you stacked two dozen of the world's tallest skyscrapers on top of each other, they still wouldn't reach the tops of the biggest thunderstorms of the ITCZ.\n\n\n\nFormer Air Force meteorologist Tim Vasquez wrote about thunderstorms over the Atlantic at the time of the Air France plane's disappearance on his Web site, weathergraphics.com.\n\n\n\n\"Based on the infrared satellite imagery, I was able to. . .estimate the altitude of the thunderstorms at around 51,000 feet,\" he told CNN in a phone interview.\n\n\n\nVasquez himself has flown through the ITCZ at least half a dozen times.\n\n\n\n\"I remember flying from Guam to the Philippines, constantly weaving around the thunderstorms. Sometimes, though, pilots are forced to fly through them,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThat's because commercial airliners cannot fly above 50,000 feet. In addition, ITCZ thunderstorms can merge with one another to stretch far and wide, covering hundreds of miles.\n\n\n\nThe crew of Air France Flight 447 reported severe turbulence shortly before the plane disappeared.  How did the plane break into pieces? »\n\n\n\nWhen it's not storming in the ITCZ, the weather can be completely calm, with little to no wind. This stretch of ocean was particularly dreaded by sailors of the 19th century, who named it \"The Doldrums,\" because its lack of wind could leave them stuck at sea, unable to propel forward.\n\n\n\nDespite these challenges and dangers, planes and ships successfully cross the ITZC every day, thanks in part to technology that has made it easier to see where the thunderstorms are.\n\n\n\nHere are some commonly asked questions:\n\n\n\nCan hurricanes form in the ITCZ?\n\n\n\nIt's extremely rare for a hurricane to form near the equator. However, the ITCZ doesn't stay in one place all year long. In the summer, for example, it drifts more northward, where it's possible for tropical cyclones to develop from the thunderstorms there.\n\n\n\nWhat does the ITCZ have to do with the \"monsoon season\" in Asia?\n\n\n\nSince the position of the ITCZ fluctuates, the location of the heaviest rainfalls varies depending on the time of year. When the zone drifts more northward in May and June, it brings the rainy season to places like Southeast Asia and India.

But Culhane, known as \"Al,\" and the soldiers who sang along could not know how much death would hunt the recruits on that train, most of whom never made it to Europe to fight in the Great War.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey would find themselves in the deadliest influenza pandemic in history.\n\n\n\n\n\nCulhane's letters to his older brother Frank and his long-time \"chum\" Clif Pinter are a young soldier's firsthand account of life as a draftee private and how he coped with a disease that would haunt Army camps around the United States and eventually infect people around the world. Some estimates say as many as 50 million people were killed by what's called the Spanish influenza in 1918 and 1919, far more than the number killed in combat during the war.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree weeks after the train trip to Georgia, Culhane, a 21-year-old clothing salesman from Chicago, Illinois, writes again.

We have had no cases thus far but it is the intention of the medical officers to prevent any case of the disease from making an appearance. All the men who have even slight colds have been put into separate barrack which, of course, were immediately christened 'the TB ward' by the rest of the company.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat same day, September 28, 1918, he wrote his brother Frank, a Navy sailor at home awaiting orders, \"Well the Spanish Influenza has made an appearance here and we are under strict orders no visits to Chattanooga, we are certainly the hard luck guys when it comes to this quarantine proposition.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first the threat of Spanish flu is just an inconvenience for Culhane: \"I am just about fed up with staying in a district about a block square for three weeks. There is no canteen in the quarantine district and we have a hell of a time getting small supplies.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJust six days after complaining about the inconvenience, a brief but frightening note: \"Receive the enclosed letter for your information then see that Frank gets it unknown to the rest of the family.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Culhane didn't want his mother, sister and younger brother to know was that he was in the infirmary with the Spanish flu. He asks his friend Clif to write often and encourage letters from \"my friends, without of course, telling them that I am a little under the weather.\" His euphemism hid the fact that in some places more than 30 percent of people who contracted Spanish flu died.

{"question": "What did the supermodel show CNN around?", "answers": ["Prague and tells of her love for the \"Golden City,\""], "context": "London, England -- Petra Nemcova is a former Victoria's Secret supermodel-turned-philanthropist.\n\n\n\nDespite her riches, Nemcova, who grew up with few luxuries in communist Czechoslovakia, told CNN that her most important work is her charity, the Happy Hearts Fund.\n\n\n\nThe model set up the foundation after her near-death experience in the 2004 Asian tsunami. While Nemcova survived by clinging to a palm tree for eight hours, her long-term partner did not.\n\n\n\nHere, Nemcova shows CNN around Prague and tells of her love for the \"Golden City,\" what she learnt from growing up in a communist country and how she keeps smiling -- despite life's setbacks.\n\n\n\nCNN: Tell us about the first time you came to Prague.\n\n\n\nPetra Nemcova: The first time was to visit my aunt and even if Prague is in the same country as my town, it felt like a real journey. For us it was like going somewhere very special, far away, because under the Communist regime you didn't travel that much and Prague was \"wow.\"\n\n\n\nI was overwhelmed and amazed by the beauty of Prague and every time I arrive in Prague, even now, I'm still amazed. The lighting at night; the incredible architecture; the details; the history; there was a lot to learn about and a lot to discover. It was a very special experience.\n\n\n\nThe following time I went to Prague was during my early career in the fashion industry and I was traveling once, twice a week from my town to Prague. I would wake up at 5.45 in the morning, take the bus for one hour, then a tram to school. After school I would take a five-hour train to Prague. So it was quite intense at that time, but it was a great experience and it taught me a lot about being independent.\n\n\n\nCNN: How would you describe Prague, in five words?\n\n\n\nPetra Nemcova: Prague is a city of romance, of incredible architecture and history. Some people call it the \"golden city,\" some people say it's the heart of Europe -- although maybe the French don't like that very much! Paris is bigger obviously and a bit more hectic and Prague is smaller and has more of a village-y feeling compared to Paris. Prague has more of a calming vibe. It's not rush-rush-rush.\n\n\n\nI think when people come here they are surprised by the beauty of Prague and also the vivid colors. I think they may imagine Prague more in gray colors because of the communist association. But since then a lot of reconstruction has been done. Before Prague was shades of grey and black, which was quite mysterious, but now it's more happy and pretty.\n\n\n\nIn five words it's historical, inspirational, creative, romantic and beautiful.\n\n\n\nCNN: What was your childhood like?\n\n\n\nPetra Nemcova: Growing up in the Czech Republic -- at the time Czechoslovakia -- was a beautiful childhood because I didn't understand the whole concept of communism. I was only 11 when communism fell down and when the Velvet Revolution happened. I had a really beautiful childhood ... I didn't have the great luxury things, we had very little and we counted every penny. But our parents gave us something more valuable than money -- they gave us so much love and that's priceless.\n\n\n\nWe didn't get the opportunity to travel all over the world and were able to travel only within the communist countries. So we went around our country to see different castles, little towns and I loved it. So that made us richer. It also made us appreciate nature because we spent every weekend in nature. And the values you learn there are priceless too. You don't step on flowers, kick on mushrooms, you really respect nature.\n\n\n\nAnd the value of appreciation came from not having anything and then having a little bit.

{"question": "who is accusing Cain?", "answers": ["Sharon Bialek"], "context": "(CNN) -- In the midst of a swirl of rumors about Herman Cain, a woman who accuses him of sexual harassment holds a news conference. Her attorney, Gloria Allred, employs her studied grimace as Sharon Bialek tells of an encounter 14 years ago that, if true, constitutes an unreported sexual assault. At his own press conference the next day, candidate Cain issues a heated denial, having earlier hinted at a willingness to take a lie detector test.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow would the court system, America's formal arbiter of truth, evaluate the competing claims?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe courts would refuse to even consider them. In the legal world, courts scrupulously enforce statutes of limitations on accusations of improper or criminal conduct. The rules exist because it is unfair to force the accused to defend against a charge of ancient vintage. Witness memories and evidence have grown stale and the courts believe that evidence is best evaluated and most reliable when it is fresh.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rare exceptions to this rule almost always involve the abuse of children and particularly heinous crimes like murder. The law provides no sanctuary for women who seek to resurrect sexual harassment claims from as distant as 14 years in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Herman Cain now exists in the realm of politics and not the courtroom. Cain must find a way to prove his innocence to a skeptical public regarding a suspiciously large number of claims for which the statute of limitations has long since expired. Unfortunately, finding a path to the truth of sex harassment charges can often be a perilous journey.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, most professionals structure their interactions with employees of the opposite sex carefully to avoid even the hint of sexual impropriety. Glass-walled office suites are the norm, insuring that employee relationships remain open to public view. The world of \"Mad Men's\" Don Draper and his blatantly sexual overtures to female employees is mostly a thing of the past. Today's sexual harassment is far more subtle.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough legitimate claims deserve compensation, the sex harassment litigation story has a seedy underside. False complaints are sometimes rewarded with generous monetary awards and then hidden from public view with confidentiality agreements and sealing orders.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployment lawyers are accustomed to meeting with CEO clients who are initially defiant and determined to resist a false claim of sexual harassment. They want their reputations and integrity preserved. But when a high-ranking executive is involved, the company rumor vine begins to grow. Depositions are taken. Employees are pulled out of the workplace to back one side or the other. Sterling reputations begin to bleed under the slash of a thousand paper cuts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd of course, the litigation process is expensive for the company. Knowing this, experienced lawyers often urge even the innocent accused executive to agree to mediate claims informally and avoid the possibility of a very public and very embarrassing federal lawsuit. Legitimate victims are also urged to settle rather than risk losing at trial.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce mediation begins, the parties are told that public humiliation and legal costs can be avoided with a quiet, confidential settlement. Both plaintiff and defendant are simultaneously silenced by the agreement's penalty provisions. The truth of the claims will never be tested in any public forum.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is, unless the accused decides to run for public office. Then it appears the art of the leak can undermine the solidity of even the most carefully drafted of confidentiality agreements.\n\n\n\n\n\nHerman Cain said he never consented to the mediation process. The National Restaurant Association, through its board, might have negotiated its own deal with the two women who made allegations of sexual misconduct against Cain to avoid bad publicity and legal costs. Businesses will often \"settle and seal\" the case rather than endure the expense and embarrassment of defending even a falsely accused chief executive.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the sketchy reported accounts, the initial case against Cain might have been paper-thin. There is no assertion of overt sexual contact between him and the female employees in question. The website Politico, which broke the story, refers to witness accounts of episodes of conversations filled with \"innuendo\" and of \"physical gestures that were not overtly sexual\" but which made female employees feel uncomfortable.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo one who has followed Cain", "parametric_answer": "god", "parametric_answer_freq": 5, "parametric_evidencde": "God is accusing Cain.

Chip Cravaack, R-Minnesota, requires the Transportation Security Administration to study ways to speed up screening of service members and, to the extent possible, their families, when the service members are in uniform and traveling on orders.\n\n\n\n\n\nCravaack, a 24-year Navy veteran and former Northwest Airlines pilot, was inspired to introduce the bill after witnessing a soldier remove his boots while going through security at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It seemed way too excessive for someone who was obviously a patriot serving his country,\" said the congressman's spokesman, Michael Bars.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new law was signed just days after two incidents involving the same soldier at airports in North Carolina and Texas.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to court records, Trey Scott Atwater, a 30-year-old Army Green Beret, had a military smoke grenade in his bag when he was leaving Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Christmas Eve headed for Texas. He was allowed to continue on his trip.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, he was arrested at Midland International Airport in Texas on his return trip when TSA screeners found an undisclosed amount of C-4 explosives in his bag. Authorities said Atwater did not have a detonator and initiator, that it would not have been possible to detonate the explosives, and that it did not appear he was up to anything nefarious.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was not immediately clear how any checkpoint changes would impact cases like Atwater's. Bars said the new law is intended to expedite screening, but not reduce security. Currently, the TSA expedites screening for trusted travelers by dedicating a special line for them, and by allowing them to keep their shoes on and keep laptops in their carry-on bags.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new law says the TSA should establish guidelines for screening travelers in military uniforms and combat boots, and consider incorporating military personnel into trusted traveler programs that give preference to passengers who undergo pre-screening. Nothing in the law prohibits additional screening of the service member if intelligence or law enforcement information indicates that additional screening is necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November, TSA Administrator John Pistole told CNN that he was already working on ways to expedite screening for service members. The TSA was starting to tests its ability to scan military ID cards, known as \"Common Access Cards,\" at a regional airport in Monterey, CA.\n\n\n\n\n\nPistole said the TSA test would not immediately result in quicker screening for service members. But if tests are successful, \"we hope to expand that to airports that would have a large number of military personnel traveling through them,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupporters of the initiative said that by expediting the screening of military personnel, the TSA will have more time to focus on unknown travelers who could present a higher risk.\"", "parametric_answer": "congress", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will be studied by the Science, Technology, Assessment, and Ratings (STAR) committee."}

{"question": "Who is called a cavewoman?", "answers": ["The Tinkler"], "context": "(Oprah.com) -- On any given day here at \"O, The Oprah Magazine,\" there are somewhere in the neighborhood of 69 very talented, extremely detail oriented, high-energy, hardworking women and men all doing their jobs and doing them well. I love a few of them, I like a lot of them, I despise one of them. She is the Magneto to my Wolverine, the Saruman to my Frodo, the Dr. Octopus to my Spiderman. I call her The Tinkler.\n\n\n\nIt's a typical Tuesday; the office is humming along. I'm answering e-mails, writing cover lines, scheduling a dental appointment here, partial highlights there, kicking myself for not getting sushi at lunch. The sun is shining, the color printer is working -- my life is good.\n\n\n\nI mosey into the ladies' room, glance at the mirror, remind myself that fluorescent lights make everyone look as if they're in the final stages of tuberculosis, and head for a stall. And then I see it: The seat, even the floor, is covered in little yellow droplets. The Tinkler strikes again.\n\n\n\nTo date, I have been able to deduce only four things about her:\n\n\n\n1. She is female.\n\n\n\n2. She attacks between the hours of 10 a.m. and 8 p.m.\n\n\n\n3. She works alone.\n\n\n\n4. She was raised in a barn.\n\n\n\nI've been her victim more times than I can count, and it has turned me from a happy-go-lucky columnist into a bitter, paranoid germaphobe.\n\n\n\nShe has become the bane of my existence. We live in a world where our soldiers lack sufficient body armor, where Rupert Murdoch is blurring the line intended to keep the business and political interests of media owners from influencing the presentation of news, where the White House still refuses to respond to questions they promised to answer as soon as the Scooter Libby case was closed, where studies indicate that worrying you're going to get sick will actually get you sick -- and yet I am devoting an entire column to The Tinkler.\n\n\n\nAny shrink worth his or her salt will tell you that it is a mistake to think of your colleagues as family. But what is a family if not a group of people who care about you and irritate you and show up for cake on your birthday and look at pictures of your kid even when they don't feel like it and think it wouldn't kill you to put on a little makeup and a pair of heels once in a while?\n\n\n\nI've been earning a paycheck for 30 years. Whether rinsing conditioner off a Lhasa apso during my stint as shampoo girl at Mr. Whiskers Pet Boutique or breathing on the chicken breast I was about to serve a rude diner during my waitressing days, I've always found that the people I work with matter to me. Their moods, their opinions, their style influence my life. They've appreciated me, humiliated me, surprised me, and antagonized me. I've gotten flowers and I've gotten fired (and I'm pretty sure I didn't do anything to deserve either), but I've never experienced anything like The Tinkler.\n\n\n\n\"Dammit!\" I say upon encountering her latest Jackson Pollock imitation. Pat, Suzan, and Valerie each come out of their stalls to see what's wrong. I point in horror. Pat groans, Suzan moans, Val throws up her hands in disgust, and we fall into silence.\n\n\n\nThen I rally, \"At least we know it's not one of us.\" But everybody else is a suspect. \"It can't be Sudie,\" Suzan volunteers. My eyes narrow. \"What are you basing this on?\" I ask. \"I've seen her,\" she answers, \"she always heads straight for the paper seat protector.\" \"And,\" Valerie adds, \"we can cross Mamie off the list -- it happened twice while she was in Sweden.\"\n\n\n\nSixty seconds ago, the four of us were editors; now we are FBI profilers. \"She probably likes", "parametric_answer": "paleolithic woman", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "A cavewoman is a woman who lived during the Paleolithic era, typically characterized by her association with the Stone Age.

{"question": "who took the cars for a spin", "answers": ["U.S. senators"], "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- It was an odd collection of vehicles on display on Capitol Hill, ranging from a bucket truck used for repairing power lines to something resembling an enclosed golf cart to a pair of hot-looking, two-seater sports cars.\n\n\n\n\n\nLawmakers eyeball one of several alternative-energy vehicles parked this week on Capitol Hill.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat they had in common was alternative energy: The cars run on electricity and biofuels as well as gasoline. Tuesday's display attracted some U.S. senators who couldn't resist taking the vehicles for a spin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm about to have claustrophobia!\" laughed Sen. Thomas Carper, D-Delaware, as he folded himself into a yellow, low-slung vehicle known by the initials ENVI, developed by the Chrysler Corporation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Evan Bayh [Democratic senator from Indiana] and I were talking about taking a road trip in the van down there,\" said Carper, pointing to a nearby offering from General Motors. \"That's probably better for a road trip than this!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCarper then spotted Democratic colleague Tom Harkin, and joked that the sports car might draw too much attention in the Iowa senator's corn country.\n\n\n\n\n\nUndeterred, Harkin climbed in next and asked to take a test drive. But instead of starting with a growling engine and a roar of exhaust, the little yellow coupe simply rolled quietly out of its parking space.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is an electric vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe display, titled \"The Energy and Environmental Showcase,\" was intended to demonstrate for lawmakers actual production models of vehicles that may cut the nation's reliance on petroleum-based fuels. An unusual aspect of the show was that traditional Detroit nameplates such as General Motors sat next to competitors from other countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe event was organized by Bright Automotive, a small carmaker from Anderson, Indiana, to showcase its IDEA, a new, 100-mpg plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that it hopes to market for government and commercial fleets. In a statement, the company said it has applied for funding through the federal Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther manufacturers took advantage of the opportunity to bring their own vehicles to the public display, in a parking lot near the Russell Senate Office Building.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the Bush administration, Japanese automakers complained they weren't invited to a similar demonstration near the Treasury Department, despite having brought their alternative-energy cars more swiftly to the U.S. market than the Detroit automakers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut neither the competition nor the threat of bankruptcy held back the enthusiasm of a General Motors product spokesman at Tuesday's display. \"If anything, it's just a little bit of noise in the background,\" said Tony Posawatz, a GM vehicle line director.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe told CNN the automaker places high on its recovery agenda the line of Volt electric cars expected to come to market by November 2010. A silver GM sedan on display nearby uses electric batteries and a self-contained recharging engine powered by a variety of fuels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would like people to stop talking mpg,\" Posawatz said, leading a reporter toward a van powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. The Chevy Equinox on display is one of 100 now in private hands. Instead of miles per gallon, the energy plant supplies electricity and a calculation of cruising range while driving.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor now, however, drivers might still be impressed by the ZENN, a little car claiming 280 miles per gallon. The car's cruising range of about 40 miles translates to about 280 miles per gallon, according to the Canadian automaker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"ZENN\" stands for Zero Emission No Noise, said a worker who was buffing away some tree pollen that had settled on the car during the breezy afternoon. The car's top speed is about that of a strong gust of wind -- 35 mph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's supposed to be your third car in the driveway,\" explained ZENN spokesman Daniel Stiller. \"Most people drive less than 20 miles from home on streets with speed limits of 35 miles per hour or less.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe acknowledged that the car may qualify as street-legal only on local, low-speed roads.", "parametric_answer": "jim", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "A classic reference!\n\nI think I know this one...

He denied the security services paid him to change his story.\n\n\n\nAt the time of the crash, Rees was working for al Fayed's security team and was assigned to guard Dodi Fayed. He was also protecting the princess because she was Fayed's companion on the trip.\n\n\n\nHe no longer works on al Fayed's security team. Rees has said what was once a good relationship with his former employer has broken down, largely because he does into support al Fayed's conspiracy theories about the crash.\n\n\n\n\"I am not a part of any conspiracy to suppress the truth at all,\" Rees testified. \"All I have ever done is given the truth as I see it.\"\n\n\n\nIn 2000, Rees published a book, \"The Bodyguard's Story: Diana, the Crash, and the Sole Survivor,\" offering his account of the events surrounding the crash. He said al Fayed tried unsuccessfully to stop the book's publication in England.\n\n\n\nRees told CNN he wrote the book to give a definitive account of what he remembered and knew, but also to counter al Fayed's accusations that his unprofessionalism caused the accident. Rees also said proceeds from the book helped pay his legal bills.\n\n\n\nDuring the morning session, Rees testified that he had two flashbacks in the months after the crash, but his psychiatrist told him they were false memories.\n\n\n\nIn the first, Rees said, he recalled hearing the voice of a woman -- apparently Diana -- calling out, \"Dodi\" from the back seat of the car. In the second flashback, Rees said he recalled seeing a paparazzi motorbike next to the car.\n\n\n\nLawyer Ian Burnett then read from a letter written by Al Fayed to Lord Stevens, who investigated the crash for the British police. In the letter, Al Fayed says Rees is lying about losing his memory.\n\n\n\n\"He knows the detail which the security services are so eager to suppress,\" Al Fayed wrote, alluding to his belief that the crash was part of a murder plot.\n\n\n\nRees testified that he was not lying about his memory loss: \"I have no memory of -- after leaving the back of the hotel, that's", "parametric_answer": "caesar", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "Based on the context, it appears that the question is referring to the bodyguard Rees from the 2018 film \"Widows\".

{"question": "who attended court on tuesday", "answers": ["Jackson's mother, Katherine, sisters Janet"], "context": "Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's fear that promoters would \"pull the plug\" on his comeback concerts if he missed more rehearsals was unfounded, the head of the promotion company testified Tuesday in Dr. Conrad Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No one on our end was ever contemplating pulling the plug,\" said Randy Phillips, the head of AEG Live.\n\n\n\n\n\nMurray's defense lawyers contend Jackson self-administered the overdose of drugs that killed him in a \"desperate desire to get to sleep,\" because he feared without rest he would miss his next rehearsal and trigger the cancellation of his \"This Is It\" tour.\n\n\n\n\n\nJackson's mother, Katherine, sisters Janet and La Toya, and brother Randy Jackson were in court to watch Tuesday's testimony.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier Tuesday, a nurse who tried to treat Jackson's insomnia with natural remedies testified that Jackson told her that doctors assured him using the surgical anesthetic propofol at home to induce sleep was safe as long as he was monitored.\n\n\n\n\n\nJackson died two months after that conversation with nurse Cherilyn Lee, from what the coroner ruled was an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol, combined with sedatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutors contend Dr. Murray's use of propofol to treat Jackson's insomnia in his home was reckless, in part because he did not have proper equipment to monitor his patient and he abandoned him to make phone calls.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhillips was the eighth witness called by the defense since the prosecution rested its case against Murray Monday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the tour was canceled, Jackson would have to pay for all of the production and rehearsal costs, Phillips said, although the judge would not let him tell jurors how much that might have been.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefense lawyer Ed Chernoff estimated the cost to be about $40 million, leaving him \"a very, very poor man,\" but it was not while the jury was present.\n\n\n\n\n\nConcert director Kenny Ortega sent Phillips an e-mail five days before Jackson's death referring to Jackson's fear the company would \"pull the plug\" on the tour. The e-mail triggered a meeting with Jackson and Dr. Murray to address Ortega's concerns about Jackson's \"lack of focus\" and missed rehearsals, with the debut of his London shows just three weeks away.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe and Ortega were satisfied when Jackson told them \"You build the house and I will put on the door and paint it,\" suggesting he would be ready, Phillips testified.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso at the meeting, Phillips told Dr. Murray that he wanted to make sure he knew about Jackson's visits to another doctor, dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein. \"Because he's his principal physician, I thought he should know,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhillips said he was concerned because Jackson \"seemed a little distracted and not focused\" in a meeting after a visit to Klein's Beverly Hills clinic.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe defense contends Jackson became addicted to the painkiller Demerol in his frequent visits to Klein in the three months before his death. His withdrawal from the Demerol, which Murray was unaware of, would explain why Jackson could not sleep the day he died, the defense contends.\n\n\n\n\n\nTestimony from nurse Cherilyn Lee's was interrupted for 25 minutes Tuesday as she was overcome with emotion. \"I'm feeling really, really dizzy,\" Lee said. \"This is just very sensitive to me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLee and a Los Angeles doctor, both called as defense witnesses, testified that Jackson asked them for drugs to help him sleep in April 2009. This was after Dr. Murray had already agreed to work as his personal physician and placed his first orders for propofol.\n\n\n\n\n\nLee, who used IV drips loaded with vitamins, \"sophisticated\" vitamin smoothies and bedtime teas, to treat Jackson's insomnia, said Jackson became frustrated with her natural remedies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He said 'I'm telling you the only thing that's going to help me sleep right away is the Diprivan and can you find someone to help me to sleep?'\" Lee said. Diprivan is a brand name for propofol.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter some quick research, the nurse warned Jackson that it was dangerous to use", "parametric_answer": "john", "parametric_answer_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm not aware of any specific information about who attended court on a particular Tuesday.

{"question": "What is given out for free at some colleges?", "answers": ["laundry service."], "context": "(MENTAL FLOSS) -- College admissions are competitive, and not just from the student's side. Sure, sometimes it's hard to get into the college of your choice, but the schools are fighting just as hard to lure in top applicants.\n\n\n\nDavidson college students don't have to visit laundromats because they enjoy the luxury of a free laundry service.\n\n\n\nWhile some colleges boast about class sizes, graduate fellowships, and endowment growth rates, this sort of info is likely to bore the 17-year-old students they're wooing. Instead, some schools try to come up with unique perks that appeal to students, often in the form of free services.\n\n\n\nWhile the cost of these \"free\" perks is undoubtedly built back into tuition bills, when a family's spending upwards of $40,000 a year for school, it can't hurt to help them feel like they're getting something for nothing. Here are a few you might be jealous of:\n\n\n\n1. Free laundry\n\n\n\nNothing's more maddening for a college student than wanting to study, party, or sleep, only to be confronted with a massive mound of laundry. Most of us know that if left unchecked, these piles of dirty clothes can grow until they're on the brink of becoming sentient beings, but students at Davidson, an elite liberal arts college in North Carolina, don't have to worry about it. Their college does the laundry for them.\n\n\n\nSince 1919, Davidson has been operating a laundry facility that allows students to drop off their laundry and pick it up once its clean and smelling of dryer sheets. At the Lula Bell Houston Laundry, students' dress shirts and blouses are even pressed and put on hangers for them.\n\n\n\nThe laundry clears about six tons' worth of dirty clothes and linens a week, but if students prefer to keep their filthy T-shirts to themselves, the school also offers free self-service washers and dryers in the dorms.\n\n\n\nAs if that's not enough, Davidson was even more generous when its basketball team made a miraculous run to the NCAA's Sweet 16 last March. The school shelled out the cash for free bus transport to the venue in Detroit, two nights' lodging, and a free ticket to the game for any student who wanted to go cheer on their Cinderella in person. Mental Floss: 8 tuition-free colleges\n\n\n\n2. Free skiing\n\n\n\nMichigan Technological University offers a pretty standard slate of majors for its students, but it also has a real estate holding that might lure in applicants. The school owns Mont Ripley, a ski slope on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. While normal lift-ticket prices run at around $35 a day, Michigan Tech students can hit the slopes without dropping a dime.\n\n\n\n3. Free computers\n\n\n\nAt my undergrad alma mater, Wake Forest, one of the chief perks is that when you showed up for freshman orientation, the school gives you a fully loaded IBM Thinkpad and a printer. Students keep this laptop for two years, then trade it in for a new model before their junior year. Students then take this one with them when they graduate.\n\n\n\nWhile there was a downside to the system (if profs know everyone has a laptop, they're not the least bit shy about making you tote it to class), it really upped the on-campus computing efficiency. Any program you needed for a class was already loaded on the laptop, and since everyone on campus was operating one of only two types of machines, tech support could diagnose problems and fix them really quickly. Mental Floss: 12 college classes we wish our schools offered\n\n\n\n4. Free theater tickets\n\n\n\nNothing irks actors and theater owners quite so much as playing to an empty house, so if tickets are moving slowly, why not fill the seats with college students? NYU's Ticket Central can wrangle Broadway and Off-Broadway tickets for up to 75 percent off their face values, but sometimes, the school can get lucky students into theaters for free to help fill otherwise thin crowds.\n\n\n\nTicket Central also boasts that it can get students into Knicks games for as", "parametric_answer": "tuition", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "TShirts"}

After attracting some major initial interest, banking $25.1 million on Friday, the film's audience dropped off dramatically during the weekend: It grossed $19 million on Saturday and is expected to bring in just $11.5 million on Sunday.\n\nThese are all big numbers, don't get me wrong, but, when combined with the fact that the film got a lukewarm CinemaScore grade of B from an audience that was largely comprised of older men, it all points to a rapid downward trend that may be difficult to reverse in the weeks to come.\n\nElsewhere -- yes, there were other movies playing at the multiplex this weekend! -- a number of films continued to do what \"Watchmen\" must now aspire to, perhaps in vain: They stayed strong deep into their long runs.\n\nTyler Perry's \"Madea Goes to Jail\" (No. 2) grossed $8.8 million on its third weekend; the film, Perry's biggest yet at the box office, has banked $76.5 million to date.\n\n\"Taken\" (No. 3) also moved along like the unstoppable force it has been for more than a month now, earning $7.5 million and bringing its six-week sum to $118 million.\n\nBest Picture winner \"Slumdog Millionaire\" (No. 4) was next with $6.9 million, which boosted its domestic haul to $125.4 million. And \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" (No. 5) took its eight-week total to $133.6 million thanks to another $4.2 million gross. iReport.com: What did you think of 'Watchmen'?\n\nMeanwhile, \"Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience\" (No. 9) completely fell off the map, dropping a staggering 78 percent to gross just $2.8 million. According to Box Office Mojo, that's the 15th biggest second-weekend decline of all time.\n\nOverall, the cumulative box office was up nearly 8 percent over the same frame a year ago, when 10,000 B.C. opened big, making this the fifth consecutive \"up\" weekend at the multiplex.

{"question": "who was convicted of murder", "answers": ["Amanda Knox's"], "context": "(CNN) -- Sitting at her home in West Seattle, Washington, Amanda Knox's aunt Janet Huff was watching the live television news coverage that her niece had been convicted of murder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was terrible, it was gut-wrenching just to hear them say it,\" Huff said of the verdict.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe had been up for more than 11 hours while the jury deliberated, anxiously awaiting word. She remained hopeful but deeply afraid. She couldn't eat.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the verdict was announced at about midnight in Perugia, Italy, her worst fears came true. Knox and her Italian former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were convicted of murdering Knox's roommate Meredith Kercher. Knox was sentenced to 26 years and Sollecito 25 years in prison.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the verdict, people flooded out of the Italian courtroom. When the prosecution emerged, a rush of applause followed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To see the people outside the courtroom applauding -- that just made me sick, that people can be that callous and cold,\" Huff said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoon after the verdict, Knox's parents, Curt Knox and Edda Mellas, emerged and swiftly moved through the crowd.

The cost and physical toll of constantly traveling to Italy was weighing on the family, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've looked at jobs and apartments just in case this happened,\" she said. \"There's no way we are going to leave Amanda in Italy all alone.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKnox's case has attracted widespread media attention and prompted salacious articles focusing on her sex life.

Lifschitz said he was released a few hours after being abducted. He was treated for injuries in a hospital.\n\n\n\n\"They told me that I wouldn't die unless they wanted me to,\" he said Sunday.\n\n\n\nLifschitz, who has also worked as a lawyer for Argentine Federal Police, is the former legal secretary for Judge Juan Jose Galeano, who headed the investigation into local connections to the AMIA bombing until he was removed from the case.\n\n\n\nLifschitz has testified that Galeano mishandled the investigation, including allegedly making a $400,000 bribe to a key witness. Galeano was taken off the AMIA investigation in 2003 and was removed from his position as a judge in 2005.\n\n\n\nThe investigation in the AMIA bombing has dragged on for nearly 15 years, with no indictments and a series of accusations of cover-ups and corruption.\n\n\n\nArgentina, Israel and the United States have blamed the Mideast-based Hezbollah terrorist organization for the attack.\n\n\n\nIn March 2007, Interpol issued arrest warrants for five Iranian officials and a Lebanese national in connection with the bombing. Tehran has repeatedly denied any involvement.\n\n\n\nFormer Argentine President Carlos Menem also has been investigated to see whether he was involved in a cover-up.\n\n\n\nMenem appeared in federal court Monday on an issue related to the AMIA attack investigation but declined to testify. He did submit a written statement denying that he had any involvement in a cover-up.\n\n\n\nLifschitz said his alleged abductors were interested in the possible Iranian connection.\n\n\n\n\"They started to ask about information about the SIDE (State Intelligence Secretariat) related to the AMIA attack,\" Lifschitz told CNN.\n\n\n\n\"And then they asked me about cassettes of conversations between the Iranians. That shows that the SIDE doesn't deny that they had intercepted some phone lines with the help of some judges.\n\n\n\n\"They were afraid that I had copies of these tapes and I would present them to a judge, but I told them that I don't have any copies of the tapes.\"\n\n\n\nLifschitz, who said he is a non-practicing Jew, also told CNN the men were interested in his religion.\n\n\n\n\"I always wear a rosary around my neck, and they grabbed me by the neck and said, 'Why are you wearing this if you're a Jew?'\"\n\n\n\nIn addition to the AMIA attack, a similar deadly anti-Semitic terrorist attack took place on March 17, 1992, when 29 people died and more", "parametric_answer": "crime", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm happy to help!

{"question": "What has Joannie Rochelle earn?", "answers": ["bronze medal in the women's figure skating final,"], "context": "Vancouver, British Columbia (CNN)  -- Holding the Olympic medal she and her mom always wanted, Joannie Rochette finally smiled and talked about when she was a young skater and desperately wanted to make her mother proud.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer mom, Therese, was her biggest supporter and sometimes her biggest critic, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe wasn't the best \"coach,\" and she was kind of picky, but she had such a good eye, Rochette said. She was always encouraging, too, even when she was finding fault.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And even though she's not here anymore, I'm not afraid to say it, sometimes she was a pain in the ass,\" Rochette said laughing, probably for the first time in days.\n\n\n\n\n\nRochette made her mom very proud Thursday night, winning a bronze medal in the women's figure skating final, just four days after Therese Rochette died of a heart attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout her mother to support her, Joannie Rochette skated into Canada's collective heart by relying on all those years of training, all those years of committing jumps and spins to muscle memory. And when she needed it most, she relied on the memory of how her mom would always convince her that she was going to be on the Olympic medals podium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It feels good for me to talk about her,\" she said, joyfully recounting the many times her mom took her to practice and stay when the other moms left. She laughed when she told how her mom would assess a school test score of 98 with a \"What about those other two points?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She was my biggest fan, my best friend. She was with me every step of the way,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen things weren't going so well in the first week Rochette was here for Olympics training, she called her mom, seeking her advice on what to do about her triple Lutz. Her mom assured her it would be all right, that she just needed to visualize doing it well in her head, that this was something she had done for years.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut doing what she did this week was something no person can ever be prepared for. To compete in the spotlight of the Olympics' marquee event, in front of an expectant and hopeful home crowd, with the heartache of her mother's death so present would take strength most of us cannot imagine. But the people closest to her knew she had that strength.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer coach, Manon Perron, said there was never any doubt that Rochette would skate and never a doubt that she wouldn't be standing on the medals podium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Never ... because she was so ready and the goal was so strong,\" Perron said, just like a proud mom. \"I've been with her since she was 12 so we just have to look into each other's eyes and we know right away. It was really hard on her because her mom was the biggest thing in her life, but she's not a quitter.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRochette said she struggled more than she showed during Tuesday night's short program that captivated the skating world. When she stepped on the ice, her legs were shaking, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith mom in 'heart and soul,' Rochette goes for medal\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't know how I ever got through this whole program.

The free skate scores are weighted more and account for roughly two-thirds of a skater's total.\n\n\n\n\n\nKim made it impossible for Rochette to dream of gold with an amazing free skate that was the best ever under the 6-year-old scoring system -- 150.06. The score was so high it would have beaten seven skaters' combined marks on its own. Her total of 228.56 is also a record.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsada then put up a 131.72, virtually clinching silver.\n\n\n\n\n\nRochette came on the ice, looking determined, to", "parametric_answer": "olympic medals", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm happy to help!

{"question": "What did the Tech crunch founder call silicone valley?", "answers": ["a pure meritocracy,"], "context": "(CNN) -- Last Wednesday, a Twitter fight erupted between technology experts Michael Arrington, founder and former editor of TechCrunch, and Vivek Wadhwa, a technology researcher and writer, after a screening of CNN's documentary, \"The New Promised Land: Silicon Valley.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nArrington said a few very clear things about his view of the state of diversity in Silicon Valley. Among them: There may be very few African-Americans in Silicon Valley, but despite this Silicon Valley is a pure meritocracy, and one becomes successful because he or she has a \"big brain.\" Vivek disagreed. As an Indian-American entrepreneur, he said he sees significant bias in Silicon Valley, and even recounted a specific instance where he was told, \"You people don't make good CEOs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, let me say, I think Arrington truly believes everything he has said about the tech world being a meritocracy. Lots of people believe it.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut not me. I would more properly say that tech markets are a meritocracy. There are very few businesses where an individual in his or her bedroom can create a piece of software that can potentially touch millions of people, and do this without seeking any additional capital. No matter how talented you are, if you want to open a hot new restaurant or a shoe factory, you need lots of money before you start. Not necessarily so with software.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumers and businesses, for the most part, don't care about the ethnicity of their software or Internet service vendor. Users want solutions. So if an entrepreneur can get a great product completed cheaply, he or she can often compete on a totally even footing with anyone else. Even if the entrepreneur ultimately needs capital, explosive initial success knocks down all known barriers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the market makers operate in a world that is not particularly evenhanded. The market makers are the folks who help new young companies and entrepreneurs by providing insight, mentoring, capital and relationships. This part of the tech world is driven by all the same biases that exist in the nontech world. And it is much harder for even the most talented African-Americans in the tech world to gain access to influential, insightful, connected mentors, let alone investors.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is this? For the most part, people want to work with people who are \"like them\" or who fit a pattern that appeals to them. There is an actual term for this among tech investors called \"pattern matching.\" It's the idea that, without objective facts, one can decide whether someone is likely to be successful based on indirect criteria. In other words, when they see a particular pattern of \"personhood,\" they are excited.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch trailer for CNN documentary \"The New Promised Land: Silicon Valley\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThese patterns are discussed openly in the tech industry around issues like age. Since it is only moderately politically incorrect to suggest that younger entrepreneurs are \"better,\" it is done all the time. The best example of this might be Mike Moritz from Sequoia Capital, perhaps the most influential of all venture funds, admitting in a Building 43 interview that they have a strong bias toward very young entrepreneurs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if you believe that age is the only criteria that venture capitalists use for pattern matching, I wanna smoke some of what you've got.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be clear, I am not saying any venture capitalist says at a partner meeting, \"You know I really like this company's product, but did you notice he's a Negro?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNever happens.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I firmly believe, based on my 25 years in this industry, that market makers, both investors and the people who help you get ready to approach them, seek out entrepreneurs who appeal to them on some less than objective, visceral level, who feel \"comfortable\" to them. They don't need to actively filter out undesirable profiles. They just focus on what does appeal to them.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoledad O'Brien: Michael Arrington is right (about one thing)\n\n\n\n\n\nThey focus on the \"patterns\" they find appealing -- age is arguably a part of", "parametric_answer": "valley", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "Michael Arrington, the founder of TechCrunch, referred to the region around Silicon Valley, California as \"Silicon Valley\" and also used the term \"Silicon Flats\" to describe it."}

She has been missing since January 24, 2006.\n\nLast week, on the third anniversary of Kesse's disappearance, an inmate in a Florida prison said he might have the answer.\n\nDavid Russ, a convicted killer being held at the Seminole County Jail, spoke last week with the missing woman's father, Drew Kesse, claiming he had information that could lead to a break in the case.\n\nDetails are being withheld from the public. In a jailhouse phone call with CNN, Russ hinted he'd eavesdropped on other inmates. He also was outspoken about his skepticism toward investigators.\n\n\"The investigators have messed this case up from the beginning and cannot be trusted,\" he said. That's why he asked to speak directly with the missing woman's father, he said.\n\nOrlando police are just as skeptical of Russ. They said he provided information they already had.\n\n\"His information is not some big break in the case,\" said Sgt. Barbara Jones of the Orlando Police Department. \"We are still hoping for new tips that could lead us to finding Jennifer Kesse.\"\n\nThe 24-year-old financial adviser was just back from a Caribbean vacation with her boyfriend and was getting back into her routine. She went to work at her new job, came home to her new condominium and called her parents.  Watch an update on the case »\n\nAt 10 p.m., she called her boyfriend, who lived in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Then, her family believes, she went to bed.\n\nThe next morning, she got up and showered for work. Her clothes were neatly laid out on her bed, her family says, suggesting she may have tried on a few outfits before deciding what to wear to the office. Then, she disappeared, her family said.\n\nShe did not show up for work that Tuesday morning and her employer reported her missing.\n\nPolice found Kesse's Chevy Malibu two days later. It was parked in a gated lot about one mile down the road from the condominium complex where she lived. Inside the vehicle, police found some of Kesse's personal items, but her purse, wallet, two cell phones and briefcase were missing. The car doors were locked and the car keys were not found.\n\nPolice later released a video surveillance tape of the car being parked in the lot by someone other than Kesse.\n\nThe grainy video partially shows a person walking away from the car, past a parking lot gate. Police are uncertain if this person of interest is a man or a woman, because the image is partially obscured by the gate.\n\nThe person is described as 5 feet 4 inches, with a short haircut, wearing light-colored clothes and dark shoes. The video is time and date-stamped at noon on the day Kesse disappeared.\n\nForensic tests on the vehicle came back inconclusive, Sgt. Jones said. No blood or other trace evidence was found to show that Kesse had been injured in the vehicle.\n\nDrew Kesse said that every Tuesday, landscapers worked at the condo complex near his daughter's parking space. The landscapers said they didn't see Kesse leaving her apartment and getting into her car, which she did every weekday morning between 7:30 and 7:45 a.m.\n\n\"The only theory we could come up with is that she walked out her front door and was kidnapped somewhere between her front door and the parking lot where her car was. We think since the landscapers didn't see her, she must not have even made it out of the hallways or stairwells of the condo complex,\" Drew Kesse said.\n\nHe added that there weren't any surveillance cameras in the hallways or stairwells at the time his daughter was living there.\n\nSgt.

She was at the family's home on Sullivan's Island in South Carolina with her four sons and a few friends.\n\n\n\n\"Don't you know that is what Jenny Sanford is about? That is what is authentic about Jenny Sanford.

I therefore asked my husband to leave two weeks ago.\n\n\n\n\"This trial separation was agreed to with the goal of ultimately strengthening our marriage.

{"question": "What  is five hours from Berlin by train?", "answers": ["Sylt"], "context": "(Travel + Leisure) -- With its tranquil beaches, the tiny northern island of Sylt is the country's best-kept summer secret.\n\n\n\nAn ideal way to see the island -- especially in late summer when the heather is in full bloom -- is by bike.\n\n\n\nWhere to stay\n\n\n\nLong and narrow, and spread over 36 square miles, Sylt has a verdant countryside peppered with its signature low-slung cottages. Many house tiny hotels, like the secluded Dorint Söl'ring Hof (1 Am Sandwall, Rantum; 49-4651/836-200; doubles from $550), a 15-room inn tucked into the dunes on the southern coast with its own hidden stretch of sugary sand.\n\n\n\nFor those who want to be closer to the action, there's the Hotel Stadt Hamburg (2 Strandstrasse; 49-4651/8580; doubles from $253), in the charming village of Westerland. You'll have to walk five minutes to the beach, but this tidy hotel, built in 1869, is an ideal base for exploration.\n\n\n\nWhere to eat\n\n\n\nThe island's dining scene attracts a number of German celebrities (Claudia Schiffer, Boris Becker), and many frequent the stylish Sansibar (80 Hörnumer Str., Rantum; 49-4651/964-656; dinner for two $130). The restaurant's North Sea-meets-Asian dishes, like fresh mussels in a sweet curry sauce, are a potent draw.\n\n\n\nIn Kampen, you'll find Greta's Rauchfang (5 Strönwai; 49-4651/ 42672; dinner for two $92) next to Louis Vuitton and Hermès. Here, socialites enjoy bottles of Kristall (opened dramatically with sabers), along with small plates of the sweet local shrimp.\n\n\n\nTo get away from the fabulous set, head to Alter Gasthof (5 Alte Dorfstrasse, List; 49-4651/877-244; dinner for two $65) on the isle's northern tip. This 200-year-old inn dishes out classic regional food, including stellar house-smoked salmon and eel.\n\n\n\nWhat to do\n\n\n\nSylt is known for its nude beaches. The most famous is Buhne 16 (133A Listlandstrasse, Kampen), where Germans of every stripe let it all hang out as they lounge in wicker basket chairs. For those who like things a bit more covered up, try Am Roten Kliff, just north of Kampen, which is also (no surprise) less crowded.\n\n\n\nAn ideal way to see the island -- especially in late summer when the heather is in full bloom -- is by bike. Fahrrad am Bahnhof (49-4651/5803), in Westerland's main train station, has a terrific rental selection, and the staff will happily suggest a route along Sylt's 136 miles of well-laid-out paths.\n\n\n\nGetting there\n\n\n\nSylt is reached by train from Berlin (5 hours) or Hamburg (3 1/2 hours). By car, take the autobahn to Niebüll from Berlin (290 miles) or Hamburg (120 miles). There is no road connecting Sylt to the mainland; vehicles board a train for the 30-minute trip to the island.

{"question": "Have the teens charged pled guilty?", "answers": ["All three pleaded not"], "context": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- Just taking a sip of water or walking to the bathroom is excruciatingly painful for 15-year-old Michael Brewer, who was burned over 65 percent of his body after being set on fire, allegedly by a group of teenagers.\n\n\n\n\"It hurts my heart to see him in pain, but it enlightens at the same time to know my son is strong enough to make it through on a daily basis,\" his mother, Valerie Brewer, told CNN on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nBrewer and her husband, Michael Brewer, Sr., spoke to CNN's Tony Harris, a day after a 13-year-old boy who witnessed last month's attack publicly read a written statement:\n\n\n\n\"I want to express my deepest sympathy to Mikey and his family,\" Jeremy Jarvis said. \"I will pray for Mikey to grow stronger every day and for Mikey's speedy recovery.\"\n\n\n\nJarvis' older brother has been charged in the October 12 attack in Deerfield Beach, Florida.\n\n\n\nWhen asked about the teen's statement, Valerie Brewer -- who knows the Jarvis family -- said she \"can't focus on that.\"\n\n\n\n\"I would really like to stay away from that because that brings negative energy to me and I don't need that right now,\" she said.\n\n\n\nHer son remains in guarded condition at the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center. He suffered second- and third-degree burns over about two-thirds of his body, according to the hospital's associate director, Dr. Carl Schulman.\n\n\n\nThe teen faces a lifelong recovery from his injuries, Schulman told CNN's Harris.\n\n\n\n\"Michael's still got a lot of major surgery ahead of him, a lot of rehabilitation and therapy,\" Schulman said. \"He's doing about as well as could be expected at this point in his recovery, but he's got a period of probably several weeks to a couple of months still left in the hospital if everything goes well, but the recovery is lifelong. This is truly a life-changing event.\"\n\n\n\nValerie Brewer said her son's treatment is excruciating at times. Physical therapy, she said, is \"incredibly painful. He almost cries because it's so painful. He's burned badly on the backs of his knees and every time he moves his knee, it pulls, and if it's healing, it pulls the scab and it cracks, and it starts to bleed.\"\n\n\n\nThe boy must undergo hour-and-a-half showers, she said, where \"they take a piece of gauze, and they wipe off all the dead skin. They give him painkillers for that, but it's incredibly painful and it breaks my heart every time they have to do it. ... That's what we call the torture hour.\"\n\n\n\nHeavy metal musician Ozzy Osbourne sent Brewer a CD, and he plays it on a boom box during the showers, she said. \"He focuses on Ozzy, and he gets through his torture hour.\"\n\n\n\nPolice were able to interview Brewer on Monday for the first time since the incident. Hospital officials have said Brewer can communicate only in one- or two-word answers.\n\n\n\nValerie Brewer would not go into details about what her son told investigators, but said that \"he answered the questions they asked.\"\n\n\n\nThe interview was emotional for both the teen and the investigators, according to Maria Schneider, a prosecutor with the state attorney's office in Broward County.\n\n\n\n\"It was difficult for him to talk about. Difficult for us to listen to,\" she said of the interview. \"Just difficult all around, heart-wrenching. He's doing so much better, but it's such a terrible situation.\"\n\n\n\nDenver Jarvis and Matthew Bent, both 15, are accused along with a third teen, Jesus Mendez, 16, of being in a group that poured alcohol over Brewer and set him ablaze in a dispute over $40, a video game and a bicycle.

{"question": "who is the bollywood star", "answers": ["Anil Kapoor"], "context": "(CNN) -- Actor and producer Anil Kapoor has long been a Bollywood luminary, but after his award-winning performance in global hit \"Slumdog Millionaire,\" he is set to become an international star.\n\n\n\nBollywood superstar Anil Kapoor.\n\n\n\nKapoor says that \"Slumdog,\" a love story about a boy from a Mumbai slum who wins a fortune on quiz show \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?,\" resembles his own life story. \"I also started from scratch, went from rags to riches,\" he told CNN.\n\n\n\nAnil is part of the Kapoor family that is a veritable Bollywood dynasty. His father Surinder and elder brother Boney are film producers, his daughter Sonam, sister-in-law Sridevi and his younger brother Sanjay are actors, while son-in-law Sandeep Marwah is a movie magnate and Anil's son Harshvardhan is currently learning to direct movies in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nBut things weren't always so glamorous. Anil Kapoor was born on Christmas Eve 1959 and grew up in a tenement in the Mumbai suburb of Chembur, with eight people living together in a single room. His father Surinder had yet to make his name in the film industry, but young Anil clearly had movies in his blood. \"In my childhood I was surrounded by films, actors, film makers, directors and film talk. I would bunk school to watch movies,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHe was cast in his first movie aged just seven. Although the film was never released, the experience was enough to convince Kapoor that his future lay in the movies.\n\n\n\nAfter finishing school he went to St Xavier's College, where he acted in plays and won the Best Actor trophy at an inter-collegiate competition, before being expelled for non-attendance. Kapoor responded by enrolling in acting classes and taking singing and dance lessons.\n\n\n\nHe made his Bollywood debut in 1979's \"Hamare Tumhare,\" before moving on to Telugu-language movie \"Vamsa Vriksham\" in 1980, and landing his first Bollywood starring role in 1983's \"Woh 7 Din.\"\n\n\n\nWatch Anil Kapoor take CNN on a tour of Mumbai. »\n\n\n\nKapoor first met future wife Sunita Bhambhani in 1979, when she was a successful model and he was still a struggling actor. He decided that he would propose marriage as soon as he got his big break and 1984's \"Mashaal\" was the opportunity he'd been waiting for. Kapoor's performance won him Best Supporting Actor at India's prestigious FilmFare awards and he married Sunita in May of that year.\n\n\n\nKapoor cemented his status a Bollywood idol after starring in the hugely successful \"Mr India,\" which promptly became his nickname among a growing legion of fans.

{"question": "Which state official has not signed the Arizona bill?", "answers": ["Gov. Jan Brewer."], "context": "(CNN) -- Now that Arizona lawmakers have passed what's considered some of the toughest immigration legislation in the country, other states are watching to see whether they should follow in the state's footsteps or stand back.\n\n\n\n\n\nArizona's bill orders immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there's reason to suspect they're in the United States illegally. It also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them.\n\n\n\n\n\nCritics, including immigrant advocates and the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, are concerned that the legislation will foster racial profiling, arguing that most police officers don't have enough training to look past race while investigating a person's legal status.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill made it through the state Senate on Monday after it was passed by the state House last week. It's now awaiting the signature of Republican Gov. Jan Brewer. Supporters of the measure expect her to sign it. Latino members of Congress are calling on Brewer to veto it.\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Hethmon, general counsel for the Immigration Reform Law Institute, helped draft the language of the Arizona bill. The institute is the legal affiliate of the Federation for American Immigration Reform.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the heels of the Arizona initiative, Hethmon said he has been approached by lawmakers from four other states who have asked for advice on how they can do the same thing where they live. He declined to identify the states, citing attorney-client privilege.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Arizona was meant to be the leading edge,\" Hethmon said. \"If you are going to work on developing a state-based response to this enormous problem -- the lack of a national immigration policy -- Arizona is the place to do it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHethmon pointed to Arizona's history of citizen ballot initiatives in support of immigration reform, noting that \"what's happening in Arizona just didn't pop out of nowhere. It's the latest step in a fairly deliberate process.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican State Rep. Russell Pearce, who sponsored the legislation in Arizona, said the four initiatives he put on the 2006 ballot regarding illegal immigrants passed by an average of 75 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nState laws relating to immigration have increased in recent years, according to numbers from the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2005, 300 bills were introduced. The next year, that number nearly doubled, and in 2007, more than 1,500 bills were introduced. Another 1,305 were introduced in 2008, and about 1,500 were considered in 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 15 percent of those were enacted, dealing with issues such as driver's licenses, health and education.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout1,000 bills have been brought up so far this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nHethmon cited the election year, the Democratic leadership's position on the issue and the tough economic times as catalysts for introducing legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Historically, not only in the U.S. but in virtually all industrialized nations, when the unemployment rates go up ... the public becomes much less sympathetic toward programs which bring in large numbers of foreigners as workers and economic players,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether Arizona becomes the standard-bearer on illegal immigration depends on the fate of the legislation, said Ann Morse, the program director of the National Conference of State Legislatures' Immigrant Policy Project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Certainly states will look at it, but not in a rush,\" she said. With court challenges promised from opponents, states will be watching to see if the legislation is deemed constitutional and if it's costly, Morse said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOmar Jadwat, the staff attorney with the ACLU's Immigrants Rights' Project, said following in Arizona's footsteps would take states in the wrong direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Although we are aware that people are trying to convince other legislatures to go down this path, I think it's clear that both as a policy matter and a legal matter, that Arizona's approach is the wrong one,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsabel Garcia, a legal defender in Arizona's Pima County, blasted the bill as \"the most dangerous precedent in this country, violating all of our due process rights.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have not seen this kind of legislation since the Jim", "parametric_answer": "california", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "The answer is: President of the United States (Joe Biden)"}

The test was conducted by scientists at the Idaho National Laboratory.\n\n\n\nIn October, the North American Electric Reliability Corp. told Congress that 75 percent of utilities had taken steps to mitigate the Aurora vulnerability, but Langevin said it now appears that Congress was misled.\n\n\n\nA congressional audit of the electric reliability corporation's claim cast doubt on the assertion that most utilities were taking steps to fix the problem.\n\n\n\n\"It appears that they just made those numbers up,\" Langevin said. \"It is not acceptable.

Even the setting, though new, will be familiar to most readers: Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\nThis time, Langdon is lured to the Capitol to save his mentor, Peter Solomon, a prominent member of the Freemasons who's been kidnapped by a cryptic, heavily tattooed, Homer-reading psycho calling himself Mal'akh -- a vicious fellow even less plausible than the albino monk in \"The Da Vinci Code.\"\n\n\n\nOur hero is also in possession of an ancient Masonic artifact whose clues lead him on a treasure hunt to various D.C. tourist spots as he searches for a secret long hidden by the brotherhood.  Watch the frenzy surrounding \"The Lost Symbol\" »\n\n\n\nThat secret, of course, is one giant MacGuffin -- though Brown is the rare thriller writer who seems to lavish as much attention on the object that sets his plot in motion as he does on the action itself.\n\n\n\nBut for thriller fans, it's the chase that really matters. Especially since the secrets of Freemasonry just aren't as compelling as, say, a controversial theory about Mary Magdalene and Jesus.\n\n\n\nLuckily, Langdon remains a terrific hero, a bookish intellectual who's cool in a crisis and quick on his feet, like Ken Jennings with a shot of adrenaline. The codes are intriguing, the settings present often-seen locales in a fresh light, and Brown mostly manages to keep the pages turning -- except when one of his know-it-all characters decides to brake the action for another superfluous, if occasionally interesting, historical digression. (Did you know there's a carving of Darth Vader on the National Cathedral?)\n\n\n\nEven after the book's climactic showdown, you must slog through another 50-plus pages of exposition that Brown couldn't cram into the main narrative.

His wife and kids, the housebroken dog, the vacation home on Cape Cod all vanished when he was sent to prison for an arson in 1996.\n\n\n\nKenneth Brown, a former inmate, learned to meditate during his nine years in prison.\n\n\n\nTrapped in his gloomy cell and serving a 20-year sentence that felt like an eternity, Brown, then 49, found himself stretched out on the floor. He was silent. His eyes were shut. His body did not move.\n\n\n\nBrown, a man raised as a Baptist and taught to praise the Lord and fear the devil, was meditating.\n\n\n\n\"I try to focus on the space between two thoughts, because it prevents me from getting lost,\" said Brown, who discovered meditation, yoga and Buddhist teachings three months into his sentence.\n\n\n\n\"This helped me stay on track and get me through prison,\" he said.\n\n\n\nEastern religions encompassing meditation techniques have captivated hippies, 20-somethings and celebrities like actor Richard Gere. But since the 1960s, the art of meditation also has found a growing number of unlikely followers behind prison bars.\n\n\n\nThe inmates say meditation -- an ancient practice that develops mental awareness and fosters relaxation -- is teaching them how to cope in prison.\n\n\n\n\"Mostly, the people in Buddhist community are going into the prisons, providing programs, and word of mouth gets from one inmate to another,\" explained Gary Friedman, communications chairman for the American Correctional Chaplains Association. \"It's a break from all the hustle and noise of the prison environment.\"\n\n\n\nThere is no group tracking the number of inmates converting to Buddhism or engaging in meditation practices. But programs and workshops educating inmates about meditation and yoga are sprouting up across the country.\n\n\n\nMeditation can help the convicts find calmness in a prison culture ripe with violence and chaos. The practice provides them a chance to reflect on their crimes, wrestle through feelings of guilt and transform themselves during their rehabilitative journey, Buddhist experts say.\n\n\n\nIn the past five years, books like the \"Prison Chaplaincy Guidelines for Zen Buddhism\" and \"Razor-Wire Dharma: A Buddhist Life in Prison\" have emerged.\n\n\n\n\"This is transformative justice, as opposed to punitive,\" said Fleet Maull, founder of the Prison Dharma Network, one of the largest support networks helping inmates learn meditation and Buddhist teachings.\n\n\n\nSince its inception in 1989, Prison Dharma Network has grown from one person -- Maull -- teaching Buddhist principles to more than 75 member organizations corresponding with 2,500 individuals, many of them inmates.\n\n\n\nFor the past seven years, Maull's group has taught a weekly meditation class in Boulder County Jail in Colorado.\n\n\n\nSome inmates follow Zen Buddhism, a practice that originated in China, and meet weekly to focus their minds. Others practice Vipassana, a Buddhist practice founded in India, which consists of completing hundreds of hours of meditation in a short period of time.\n\n\n\nBuddhism has gained momentum in the United States over the past 25 years, becoming the third most popular religion in America behind Christianity and Judaism, according to the 2008 report from the the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. About 1.7 million Americans call themselves Buddhists, and many of them are converts, the study said. According to the American Religious Identification Survey in 2008, there were 1.2 million self-identified Buddhists.\n\n\n\nSome inmates, like Brown, may not label themselves official Buddhists, but they meditate, practice yoga and follow Buddhist principles on truth, responsibility and suffering.\n\n\n\nThe practice of meditation seeped into the heart of the Bible Belt in 2002. The Donaldson Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison in Alabama, was notorious for violence. But a group of male inmates, including several murderers, completed a Vipassana meditation retreat that required more than 100 hours of meditation in 10 days.\n\n\n\nOne inmate, who was featured in the 2007 documentary \"The Dhamma Brothers,\" said Vipassana was harder than the 8½ years he had spent on death row.

As many as 5 percent of Americans are at risk for a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction from insect stings, according to the organization.\n\n\n\nIn a typical week in the emergency room, doctors at Emory University Hospital Midtown in Atlanta, Georgia, see about six or fewer cases of people with allergic reactions to insects, said Dr. James P. Capes, director of the emergency department.\n\n\n\n\"It's common, but not incredibly common,\" he said.\n\n\n\nTypically, when stung by an insect, a person will have no reaction or a mild local reaction, such as redness, swelling or itching at the site of the sting. However, some people experience a more widespread reaction, such as a drop in blood pressure, lightheadedness or hives all over. iReport.com: Send us your allergy stories\n\n\n\nIn the most serious cases, a person can go into anaphylaxis, a condition in which he or she may have difficulty breathing. Other symptoms include swelling of the mouth or throat, itchy skin, wheezing, cough and localized pain, said Dr. Clifford Bassett, medical director of Allergy and Asthma Care of New York.\n\n\n\nCapes advises people who experience a systemic reaction to call 911 and wait for an ambulance, because it will have medicine to treat the reaction immediately. An antihistamine such as Benadryl will be given and, in severe cases, a shot of epinephrine.\n\n\n\nEven if the reaction is not severe, Benadryl will help with normal symptoms of insect stings, Capes said.\n\n\n\nThose who have had allergic reactions to insects should always carry an antihistamine and an epinephrine auto-injector for emergencies, experts said.\n\n\n\nInsect allergies may be harder to control than some food allergies because it's not always possible to predict when bees, wasps and other stinging bugs are around, Capes said.\n\n\n\nSevere reactions don't usually happen the very first time a person gets stung, Capes said.\n\n\n\n\"The thing about allergic reactions that is interesting, or scary, is that we never know what the next allergic reaction is going to be,\" he said.\n\n\n\nFor those who have a history of anaphylactic reactions to insects, vaccines are available for yellow jackets, wasps, honey bees and fire ants, Bassett said. The immunization process takes three to five years, he said.\n\n\n\nThere are also blood and skin tests that people can take to determine whether they are sensitive to these insects, he said.\n\n\n\nBesides anaphylaxis, people may experience other kinds of reactions, Bassett said. If a person is stung hundreds of times at once, he or she may need emergency care, as the venom may lead to seizures, shock and even death, he said.\n\n\n\nThere is also a rare reaction called serum sickness that includes joint pain and flu-like illness that may result from insect stings, and has allergy-like symptoms, Bassett said.\n\n\n\nIn rare cases, even mosquito bites can lead to anaphylaxis, Bassett said.

However, some people experience a more widespread reaction, such as a drop in blood pressure, lightheadedness or hives all over. iReport.com: Send us your allergy stories\n\n\n\nIn the most serious cases, a person can go into anaphylaxis, a condition in which he or she may have difficulty breathing. Other symptoms include swelling of the mouth or throat, itchy skin, wheezing, cough and localized pain, said Dr. Clifford Bassett, medical director of Allergy and Asthma Care of New York.\n\n\n\nCapes advises people who experience a systemic reaction to call 911 and wait for an ambulance, because it will have medicine to treat the reaction immediately. An antihistamine such as Benadryl will be given and, in severe cases, a shot of epinephrine.\n\n\n\nEven if the reaction is not severe, Benadryl will help with normal symptoms of insect stings, Capes said.\n\n\n\nThose who have had allergic reactions to insects should always carry an antihistamine and an epinephrine auto-injector for emergencies, experts said.\n\n\n\nInsect allergies may be harder to control than some food allergies because it's not always possible to predict when bees, wasps and other stinging bugs are around, Capes said.\n\n\n\nSevere reactions don't usually happen the very first time a person gets stung, Capes said.\n\n\n\n\"The thing about allergic reactions that is interesting, or scary, is that we never know what the next allergic reaction is going to be,\" he said.\n\n\n\nFor those who have a history of anaphylactic reactions to insects, vaccines are available for yellow jackets, wasps, honey bees and fire ants, Bassett said. The immunization process takes three to five years, he said.\n\n\n\nThere are also blood and skin tests that people can take to determine whether they are sensitive to these insects, he said.\n\n\n\nBesides anaphylaxis, people may experience other kinds of reactions, Bassett said. If a person is stung hundreds of times at once, he or she may need emergency care, as the venom may lead to seizures, shock and even death, he said.\n\n\n\nThere is also a rare reaction called serum sickness that includes joint pain and flu-like illness that may result from insect stings, and has allergy-like symptoms, Bassett said.\n\n\n\nIn rare cases, even mosquito bites can lead to anaphylaxis, Bassett said. There is no treatment for mosquito allergies, but there is a diagnostic test, he said.\n\n\n\nBassett offers the following tips to reduce the danger of insects:\n\n\n\n• Stay away from stinging insect nests when possible.\n\n\n\n• Consider wearing closed-toed shoes in an area where there may be many stinging insects.\n\n\n\n• Remain calm and quiet around a stinging insect, and move slowly away from it.\n\n\n\n• Avoid brightly colored clothing, as well as perfumes and scented hair products and lotions.\n\n\n\n• Avoid loose-fitting clothing, which can accidentally", "parametric_answer": "disease", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "In rare cases, mosquito bites can lead to diseases such as:\n\n* Malaria\n* Dengue fever\n* Yellow fever\n* Zika virus\n* Chikungunya\n* West Nile virus\n* Eastern equine encephalitis\n* Western equine encephalitis\n\nNote: Mosquito bites"}

Our thoughts and prayers go out to Nick's family, friends, loved ones and fans.\"\n\nOne person was arrested in connection with the three-vehicle accident, which occurred about 12:23 a.m. Thursday in Fullerton, south of Los Angeles. Witnesses say a red minivan ran a red light and struck two vehicles at an intersection, police Lt. Craig Brower said.\n\nOne of the vehicles, a gray Mitsubishi, slammed into a power pole, Brower said. Two of its passengers were declared dead at the scene, he said. The other two were transported to UC Irvine Medical Center.\n\nMurray said Adenhart underwent surgery and died at the hospital but did not know whether he died during or after the procedure. Brower said the remaining passenger was in critical condition.\n\nThe Angels said the two dead at the scene were the female driver of the Mitsubishi and another male. No other members of the Angels organization were involved, the team said.\n\nAdenhart reportedly was \"in bad condition at the scene,\" team spokesman Tim Mead said, and there wasn't much that could be done for him at the hospital. He died \"mid- to late morning,\" Mead said.\n\nA passenger in the minivan was taken to a hospital with minor injuries, Brower said. The third vehicle sustained minor damage, and its driver was unhurt, he said. Police did not identify any of the dead.\n\nThe minivan's driver fled the scene and was later arrested, Brower said. Andrew Thomas Gallo, 22, of Riverside will face charges of manslaughter, felony driving under the influence and hit-and-run, he said.\n\nFootage from the scene showed the minivan with a smashed front end and the Mitsubishi, which was heavily damaged. Debris littered the intersection where the crash took place, and it was cordoned off with yellow police tape.\n\nThe Angels' game Thursday night with the Oakland A's was postponed at the direction of Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig. No information was released as to when the game would be played.\n\n\"Major League Baseball is in mourning today upon the news of this tragedy that has taken Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart and two others,\" Selig said in a statement. \"Nick was just 22 years of age, with a wonderful life and career ahead of him. On behalf of Major League Baseball, I extend my sincere sympathy to the families and friends of all three victims and to the entire Angels' organization. I send my deepest condolences to Nick's parents, Jim and Janet. The hearts of everyone in baseball are with them at this most difficult time.\"\n\nThe Angels quoted Adenhart's family in the team statement, saying they express \"sincere gratitude for all the help the Angels have provided.\"\n\n\"He lived his dream and was blessed to be part of an organization comprised of such warm, caring and compassionate people,\" Adenhart's parents said. \"The Angels were his extended family. Thanks to all of Nick's loyal supporters and fans throughout his career. He will always be in everyone's hearts forever.\"\n\nFuneral and memorial arrangements were pending, the team said.\n\nAdenhart pitched in a game against the Oakland A's on Wednesday night in Anaheim, California, making a \"brilliant effort\" despite the Angels' 6-4 loss, according to MLB.com.\n\nIn his fourth major league start, Adenhart pitched a scoreless six innings, with seven hits, three walks and five strikeouts.\n\n\"", "parametric_answer": "32", "parametric_answer_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm happy to help!

In this stunt -- which has since become a Western classic -- he portrays a galloping warrior during an Indian attack on a stagecoach. He jumps from his own horse to the six-horse team pulling the stagecoach, is shot, falls, and is dragged underneath the fast-moving team and stagecoach.\n\n\n\n3. \"Ben Hur\" (William Wyler, 1959)  Stunt: Chariot race Stuntman: Joe Canutt\n\n\n\nCanutt (son of Yakima) doubles for Charlton Heston in the famous chariot race. Half way through, things veer off plan and he is forced down the inside part of the track straight towards a wrecked chariot. When his charito hits, Canutt is flung over the front of the chariot, where he clings before clambering back on.

{"question": "Did the negotiators reach a deal?", "answers": ["reached an agreement late Thursday to form a government of national reconciliation."], "context": "(CNN) -- Four months after he was escorted in his pajamas onto a military plane and flown out of the country, ousted Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya could return to power within days, analysts said Friday.\n\n\n\nNegotiators for Zelaya and Roberto Micheletti, the politician who was appointed president hours after Zelaya's June 28 removal, reached an agreement late Thursday to form a government of national reconciliation. The nation's congress, in consultation with the supreme court, must approve Zelaya's return to power.\n\n\n\nThe reconciliation government would rule until a new president, to be chosen in November 29 elections, takes office in January.\n\n\n\nMicheletti announced the agreement in a televised speech to the nation Thursday night.\n\n\n\nZelaya said Friday his return to the presidency is \"imminent\" and should occur within days. He has been staying at the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, since secretly returning to the country September 21.\n\n\n\n\"At this moment we are trying to reach a consensus so we can reconstruct democracy,\" he told CNN en Español on Friday.\n\n\n\nAlthough Zelaya's return to the presidency is not guaranteed in the eight-point pact, several analysts say they expect the congress will approve the measure.\n\n\n\n\"If Micheletti came forward with a public announcement, the odds of this being approved by congress are pretty good. It's a done deal,\" said Kevin Casas-Zamora, a senior foreign policy fellow at the non-partisan Brookings Institution and a former vice president of Costa Rica. \"It would be a horrible letdown if congress did not approve the agreement.\"\n\n\n\nPeter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue policy institute, also believes \"they'll go ahead and vote for it.\"\n\n\n\nSaid Larry Birns, director of the liberal Council on Hemispheric Affairs: \"There seems to be no other way.\"\n\n\n\nThe United States played a key role in the accord after weeks of stalemate. Thomas Shannon, assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, and two other high-level U.S. officials arrived Wednesday and met separately with Zelaya and Micheletti. An agreement appeared possible Thursday when Shannon announced at a news conference that the U.S. delegation would stay another day.\n\n\n\nA delegation from the Organization of American States had visited Honduras in early October but failed to obtain an agreement. Costa Rican President Oscar Arias had held consultations with both sides but did not get them to agree on a solution.\n\n\n\nThe OAS, the United Nations, the European Union and the United States condemned the military-backed coup and demanded that Zelaya be reinstated. The United States and others imposed economic sanctions, which some analysts say have started to hurt Honduras.\n\n\n\n\"The dark secret here is that the Honduran economy has been devastated,\" Birns said. \"Huge numbers of Hondurans have crossed over into Mexico and are desperate for jobs.\"\n\n\n\nCrumbling economic conditions left Micheletti little choice, Birns said.\n\n\n\n\"All along Micheletti was holding a diminishing deck,\" he said. \"Not only the poor were being hurt. The cutoffs were hurting the nation's economic elite. So there was a very strong economic motive to reach a solution.\"\n\n\n\nThere also was a strong political motive, Hakim said.\n\n\n\n\"The candidates for president, the people looking forward, wanted to see the elections on November 29 as being legitimate,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBirns agreed that \"the candidates wanted a resolution because of legitimacy.\"\n\n\n\nThe United States and many other nations had said the elections would be considered illegitimate if held under Micheletti's rule.\n\n\n\n\"By far, the most important thing right now is not whether Zelaya will be reinstated, but that the U.S. is going to recognize the elections,\" said Heather Berkman, a Latin America analyst with the Eurasia Group consulting firm.\n\n\n\n\"The next president will be able to receive diplomatic recognition and much-needed access to international aid and financing, which will be crucial given the weakness of the economy and the fact that the government is running out of money,\" she said.\n\n\n\nZelaya also appeared to have little choice but to accept the pact,", "parametric_answer": "yes", "parametric_answer_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "I'm happy to help!

L-CROSS researchers said about 25 gallons of water were detected in the crater, which measured about 60 feet wide by a few feet deep.\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Wargo, NASA'S chief lunar scientist on the L-CROSS mission, said the probes detected more than water in the crater, but researchers are still trying to understand what the other stuff is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're opening new chapters. And in fact, because some of this information is so new and it's so different from the way we use to think about the moon, there are chapters that are blank right now,\" he said. You know that they're going to written, but we don't even know the questions yet that are going to be engendered from this new information.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWargo describes the lunar data as a treasure trove. The moon \"is like the dusty attic of the solar system, in that things get collected there and they give you insight, not just into the moon, but the evolution of the solar system.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEarthbound explorations, such as Lewis and Clark's historic journey to the Pacific Ocean in the early 19th century, carry critically necessary items, but they have no need to haul wood or water. That's not so for manned space flight. Those missions will have to carry all the supplies necessary for survival unless they can manufacture some of them either in flight or on a planet's surface.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe presence of water and other compounds on the moon means there are potential resources that could sustain future exploration of the moon and beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\nNASA is also mapping the moon's surface in unprecedented detail, eventually creating the first moon atlas. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which launched last summer, is the robotic scout that is providing the data. LRO is on a mission that could last several years -- orbiting the moon and gathering crucial data that will help astronauts prepare for another visit.\n\n\n\n\n\nWargo said LRO is carrying high-resolution cameras, which have now mapped about 50 areas on the moon, including the Apollo mission landing sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have cameras on board that have been able to image where the Apollo spacecraft landed, and you can literally see where they put down their scientific packages, where the astronauts walked on the moon,\" according to Wargo.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LRO discovered it's extremely cold in the permanently shadowed polar craters, where temperatures dip more than 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, or 249 degrees below zero Celsius. That's not far from absolute zero, defined by international agreement as 273.15 degrees below zero Celsius and a temperature that cannot be physically reached. These are the coldest temperatures ever recorded in the solar system.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LRO is also measuring space radiation on the moon. Astronauts will need protection from this radiation during expeditions to the moon and other destinations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll this information is critical if humans are to make it back to the moon by 2020, the the target date set by the Bush administration in 2004. But it's more than that. Wargo sum it up this way:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We used to think of the moon as this really dead and unchanging place, that the moon was a dead planet. ... There are changes that occur there not over the course of thousands or millions or even billions of years, but are changing over the course of days and weeks and months.

Davern offered a new account in November about how Wood's death was reported, saying that Wagner waited hours to call the Coast Guard after Wood went missing off Catalina Island, near the California coast, following an argument the couple had.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitmore declined to reveal whether detectives plan to talk with Davern, saying he would \"not get into the specifics\" of the investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigators haven't re-interviewed Wagner either. Authorities have no plans to question the actor at this time, but \"who knows where things may go from here tomorrow,\" Whitmore said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The investigation is not closed. It's possible we could yield new information that changes this case,\" the sheriff's spokesman said. \"There are leads we're following up on and have to close them out before we say anything definitive.

John Corina said at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nCorina declined to comment directly on statements made by Davern to some media outlets.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked if the captain could face charges for possibly lying to authorities during the 1981 investigation, Corina responded: \"That, I can't say. We'll probably end up talking to the captain sooner or later, and we'll assess what he has to say then and now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities haven't gone into specifics about who they've interviewed, but did say when they reopened the case that Wagner wasn't a suspect.\n\n\n\n\n\nWood drowned in the Pacific Ocean on November 29, 1981, off the isthmus of Catalina Island. She once said in a televised interview that her greatest fear was of dark seawater.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer body was found floating in the water about a mile away from the yacht, wearing a long nightgown, socks, and a down jacket, according to police reports.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe autopsy report showed the actress had two dozen bruises on her body, including a facial abrasion on her left cheek and bruises on her arms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My sister was not a swimmer and did not know how to swim, and she would never go to another boat or to shore dressed in a nightgown and socks,\" said Lana Wood, refering to theories that the actress voluntarily jumped from the boat.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the county coroner's office ruled that Wood's death was an accident, others say the case hasn't made sense.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2010, Lana Wood told CNN she believes a highly charged argument between her sister and Wagner on the yacht's back deck preceded Wood's drowning.

I think that's unfortunate,\" he said. \"I think it's a debate that's going on in our society, and now I've become kind of a poster boy for it. But I don't want to be that. I believe that celibacy is good, and that it's a good commitment to God. This is something I've struggled with. And something that I never expected to become a public debate.\"\n\n\n\nHe also talked about the woman, saying they have been friends for a long time and the attraction was there from early on, but it was not acted on until a couple of years ago. They have \"both struggled\" with the relationship, he said.\n\n\n\n\"She's also a woman of faith,\" Cutie said. \"She's also somebody who cares about the priesthood, who cares about these things.

{"question": "how many users has china?", "answers": ["338 million"], "context": "(CNN) -- \"China is not on the Internet, it's basically an intranet. Everything is banned by the Great Firewall,\" says Sherman So, co-author of \"Red Wired: China's Internet Revolution.\"\n\n\n\nSherman So, author of \"Red Wired,\" talks about China's online habits and Internet culture.\n\n\n\nWith 338 million Internet users in June 2009, according to the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), China is no longer a niche market of the online industry.\n\n\n\nChinese is the second most common language on the Internet, according to The Economist, and quickly gaining ground on English.\n\n\n\nAs the former technology writer for Hong Kong's daily English-language newspaper, South China Morning Post, So has been following closely China's exponential Internet developments over the past decade.\n\n\n\nWhat inspired her to write \"Red Wired\" was the chasm in online culture on either side of China's carefully controlled borders.\n\n\n\n\"The information gap between those who are from this part of the world and who know Chinese and those who are from another part of world and who don't is just so huge,\" observes So.\n\n\n\n\"I've talked to lots of investors, analysts, visitors to Hong Kong, and they really don't know what's happening in China. They ask the silliest questions about China and the Internet.\"\n\n\n\n\"Red Wired\" tells the stories behind China's homegrown online start-ups, often overtaking dominant start-ups that have been successful in the West but which flailed after venturing into Chinese territory.\n\n\n\nOne anecdote involves an advertisement by Baidu, China's most popular search engine, teasing Google China for not knowing Chinese.\n\n\n\nGoogle focused on high-end technology rather than Chinese linguistics. From 2002 to 2005, Google's Chinese site also suffered interference from the Chinese government, which redirected users to Baidu whenever Google's search results failed to comply with China's censorship rules.\n\n\n\nAlthough Google China has since learned the lingo and learned to cooperate with the higher order, it still trails Baidu with only 28 percent of the search-engine market share, compared to Baidu's 63 percent, according to a 2008 study by Analysys International.\n\n\n\nConquering the Internet with Chinese characteristics\n\n\n\nSo what are the unique characteristics of China's Netizens?\n\n\n\nWhile 25.5 percent of the Chinese population is now online, CNNIC's 2008 statistics sketch a relatively coherent portrait of the mainstream majority of them: 67 percent are below the age of 30; 73 percent have only a high school education or lower; 33 percent are students; and 28 percent fall into the lowest income bracket of under $75 per month.\n\n\n\nMoreover, 78 percent go online at home and 42 percent log on at an Internet cafe. Once connected, 84 percent listen to music, 75 percent instant-message, 63 percent play online games, and only 57 percent e-mail.\n\n\n\nIn short, for the vast majority of Chinese, Internet means play, not work.\n\n\n\nOne could conclude that an Internet entrepreneur's target audience in China is teenage and twenty-something students, low-end consumers in search of entertainment with plenty of time to kill.\n\n\n\nAmong the most salient of China's Internet start-ups are those that innovated on proven Western models by successfully adapting them to the Chinese market.\n\n\n\nTencent, with a 77 percent market share of instant messaging services nationwide, is one of the start-ups that gets it. Tencent is now the largest Internet company in China.\n\n\n\n\"What really made [Tencent founder] Pony Ma stand out is that he viewed his QQ instant messenger differently from other IM services such as MSN and Yahoo,\" says So.\n\n\n\n\"They viewed IM as a two-way communication, so made it as efficient as possible. They targeted the high-end white-collar users, thinking they're rich, advertisers will love them, they'll buy additional services.\n\n\n\n\"Ma thought differently.

Bush's dog Millie.\n\n\n\nIt's a good thing Obama said \"Yes, we can\" to the girls' request to getting a dog; for all of his charm, ability, and oratorical flair, he could never be our nation's chief executive without a White House pet.\n\n\n\nCounting Obama, the country has had 44 Presidents, and only two of them -- Chester A. Arthur and Franklin Pierce -- left no record of having pets.\n\n\n\nLike Obama himself, the family pooch will have some big shoes to fill. Previous White House pets have set the bar pretty high. iReport.com: What pet would you want if you lived in the White House?\n\n\n\nHere are a few of our favorites:  Watch Obama on \"mutts like me\" »\n\n\n\n1. Billy: Calvin Coolidge's pygmy hippopotamus\n\n\n\nCalvin Coolidge may have been known for his reticence, but he showed little of his trademark reserve when it came to acquiring pets.\n\n\n\nAfter taking over the presidency upon the death of Warren G. Harding, Coolidge assembled a menagerie that would rival most zoos' collections.\n\n\n\nHe had six dogs, a bobcat, a goose, a donkey, a cat, two lion cubs, an antelope, and a wallaby. The main attraction in his personal zoo, though, was Billy, a pygmy hippopotamus.  Watch new baby pygmy hippo »\n\n\n\nBilly was born in Liberia, but was captured at a young age.\n\n\n\nHe came into the possession of tire mogul Harvey Firestone, who gave Billy to President Coolidge as a gift, possibly because Firestone didn't want to feed the critter. (Even a pygmy hippo is still quite rotund; Billy was six feet long and weighed upwards of 600 pounds.)\n\n\n\nCoolidge donated Billy to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park. Because there were only a handful of pygmy hippos in the U.S. at the time, Billy quickly went to work as a stud, an endeavor at which he found some success.\n\n\n\nHe sired 23 little hippos, and many of the pygmy hippos you see in American zoos today are his offspring.

It's true.\n\n\n\nHoover owned a slew of dogs, but those weren't his only pets. His second son, Allan Henry Hoover, owned a pair of gators that were occasionally allowed to wander around the White House grounds.\n\n\n\nSound crazy? Blame John Quincy Adams for setting the precedent. The sixth president also had a pet gator. His was a gift from the Marquis de Lafayette; it lived in a bathroom in the East Room of the White House. According to some reports, he enjoyed using the gator to scare his guests.\n\n\n\n3. Fala: FDR's traveling companion\n\n\n\nWhat do you get the Depression-conquering president who has everything? A lapdog.\n\n\n\nIn 1940 Franklin Roosevelt received a Scottish Terrier puppy named Big Boy as an early Christmas gift from a family friend.\n\n\n\nFDR immediately realized that Big Boy was no name for a presidential companion and rechristened the pooch Murray the Outlaw of Falahill, after a Scottish ancestor. For the sake of simplicity, though, he called his new pal Fala.\n\n\n\nAfter that, Fala became FDR's inseparable companion and traveled everywhere the President went.\n\n\n\nThe dog \"gave\" $1 a day to the war effort, generosity that earned him the rank of honorary private in the Army. Each morning when FDR's breakfast tray came in, it included a bone for Fala.\n\n\n\nFala also made a famous appearance in one of his master's speeches.

We import about $700 billion more than we export. That hurts our capital flows, credit and other key indicators.\n\n\n\nGuess what amounts to 50 percent of that trade imbalance? Oil. We use 21 million barrels of oil every day in the United States and import 62 percent of that -- mainly from countries that really don't like us. We use that oil mainly for transportation -- cars, SUVs, and other vehicles.\n\n\n\nUnless we scrap guzzlers at a faster rate, we will never reduce our oil consumption.

Around active forest fires. On the sides of mountains. You can't even bitch at these guys for having cushy government pensions to fall back on when they get older, because they're all private-sector contractors. Which means if they aren't out fighting forest fires or doing preventative forestry on unburned woods (basically extreme landscaping), they are losing money. They are the hardest working men in the tree business.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouthern Oregon in the summer is a tinderbox. Last year the state recorded some 560 wild fires, the majority of which occurred in the seemingly endless sea of trees running across its bottom from the Cascades to the Pacific Coast. Humidity is next to nonexistent, which is extremely pleasant, but means that even an errant spark from a chainsaw or the proverbial cigarette butt out the car window can set the entire region ablaze.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlying into the Rogue Valley, there is evidence of past wild fires is everywhere: From the miles-long scar of the 2002 \"Biscuit\" fire stretching past the horizon, to the smaller pockets of charred trees crowding the edge of towns to the blue Wilderness-Firefighter-ribbon bumper stickers flying past on the I-5 to the elaborate wildfire and firefighter shrines at a local bar.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more of Oregon Fire Lines at VBS.TV\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are very few places firemen aren't revered as local heroes, but the wilderness firefighters of Oregon go past people simply risking their lives to help others into a crazy superhero realm where their work regularly prevents entire settlements from being destroyed. They're literally the guardians of their communities. Incidentally, their work is also very beneficial for the forest.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe spent a few days following a crew of Grayback forest-firefighters walk up the sides of what most people would consider a cliff, to chop down underbrush in preparation for a controlled burn. This is what they like to call \"project work\" -- the light stuff they do between fires. The work is the hardest and least rewarding work we have ever tried to do. Unless you consider 12-hour-plus shifts of backbreaking labor, virtually zero outside recognition, and occasional accusations of being shills for the timber industry rewards. Which we do not.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis piece was originally produced in August 2010", "parametric_answer": "fighting fires", "parametric_answer_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "The firefighters are doing rescue work."}

{"question": "Who bought a treadmill?", "answers": ["Evans"], "context": "(CNN) -- Name: Kevin Evans\n\n\n\n\n\nWeight in January 1994: 315 pounds\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent weight: 215 pounds\n\n\n\n\n\nSize change: Size 40 to size 32 pants.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory: Evans never took his weight into consideration growing up. He said it wasn't really a problem until he reached college. \"I've always had my baby fat, but as I got to college I started gaining more,\" he said. \"After college, it continued. After graduate school, it continued.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEvans said he was unaware of the toll the additional weight was taking on his body. His mom, Helen, said she noticed he would become breathless while completing simple tasks, but she said she was too nervous to speak up. \"I was going to say something to him about it, but I didn't want to hurt his feelings,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Aha!\" moment: One foot stepped on a scale. Then the other. Evans, a program specialist at Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth, Texas, waited in anticipation as the number beneath him rose higher. And higher. And higher.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was 315 pounds -- a weight Evans had never dreamed of reaching, but he was forced to accept the indisputable reality that flashed before him. He never wanted to reach 400 pounds. It was time for a change, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you lost weight? Tell us about your ''Aha!'' moment on iReport\n\n\n\n\n\nHow he did it: Evans purchased a treadmill to ensure he had access to workout equipment at all times without limiting himself to going to the gym or facing days of bad weather. He started doing cardio for 45 minutes, five days a week. The treadmill came with an eight-week plan for low-calorie meals that he could prepare.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe stayed focused on the program by keeping the price of the treadmill in mind: $1,200. \"I would focus on how much I paid for the treadmill and for that not to be wasted,\" he said. \"I was giving myself one chance to prove myself to myself.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBiggest obstacle: Evans said his biggest obstacle was managing his time. When he changed his diet, he included several items that he didn't usually eat, and working them into his daily routine initially was a challenge. He decided to sit down on Sundays and plan his workouts and meals for the week, including when he would prepare food.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintaining diet: While dieting, Evan aimed to eat 1,800 calories a day. Now Evans eats five meals a day, with calorie counts totaling 2,500. Some of the items on his regimen include protein shakes, eggs, turkey, almonds, baked chicken breast and steamed veggies.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintaining workouts: Evans does 20 minutes of cardio five days a week. He runs intervals for 10 minutes and then does 10 minutes of another aerobic activity such as the StairMaster or a rowing machine.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes of success: His mother said she has seen a distinct change in him, and she said she is proud of her youngest son's accomplishments. \"I think he takes more pride in himself,\" she said. \"I'm proud that Kevin is taking charge of his health.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal thoughts: \"You can't just go on a diet for a few months and lose weight and then go back to exactly how you were living before and expect everything to be the same,\" Evans said. \"Ironically, it seems like the older I get, the better I get. I am also more self-confident and proud that I have been able to accomplish this.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctor's take: Talking to loved ones about their weight can be hard. Dr. Jan McBarron, who is certified by the American Board of Bariatric Medicine, suggests approaching a friend or family member from a nonaccusatory standpoint by asking questions such as, \"How do you feel about your weight?\" Then, if he or she seems ready to change, offer to help find credible sources for weight loss information.", "parametric_answer": "john", "parametric_answer_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "There is no question about who bought a treadmill."}

An autopsy is slated for Thursday.\n\n\n\nTwo people were killed in the shootings along a three-mile stretch on and near the LBJ Freeway, about 10 miles northeast of downtown Dallas.\n\n\n\nPolice used ballistic tests to link Smith, a 12-year veteran of the Utah state police, to three of the four shootings, Dallas Police Lt. Craig Miller said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nMiller said Smith was a suspect in both nonfatal shootings and one of the fatal shootings. He said it was unclear if Smith was a suspect in the fatal shooting that occurred first.\n\n\n\nThe first attack occurred in the city of Garland at about 5:41 p.m. Victim Jorge Lopez, 20, was sitting in his Nissan at a traffic light in Garland when a man in a pickup pulled alongside him and fired shots into his car, killing him, Officer Joe Harn of the Garland police said.\n\n\n\nA few minutes later and two miles away on the LBJ Freeway, a gunman fired at two tractor-trailers.\n\n\n\nWhile one driver escaped injuries, William Scott Miller, 42, of Frankfort, Kentucky, was shot to death behind the wheel of a United Van Lines truck, police said.\n\n\n\n\"He was going to be traveling home,\" Lt.

{"question": "What he painted in 1610?", "answers": ["portrait"], "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- A portrait painted 400 years ago and kept anonymously in an Irish home for much of the time since is now believed to be the only painting of William Shakespeare created during his lifetime.\n\nThe portrait of William Shakespeare is thought to be the \"only\" portrait painted during his lifetime.\n\nThe image reveals a wealthy Shakespeare of high social status, contradicting the popular view of a struggling playwright of humble status, according to Stanley Wells, a professor who chairs London's Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.\n\nWells, a distinguished Shakespeare scholar, arranged for three years of research and scientific testing which confirmed it was painted around 1610, when Shakespeare would have been 46 years old.\n\n\"A rather young looking 46, it has to be said,\" Wells said. Shakespeare died in 1616.\n\nThe Cobbe portrait -- named after the Irish family that owns the painting -- shows Shakespeare with rosy cheeks, a full head of hair, and a reddish brown beard.\n\nThe most common portrait of Shakespeare is a gray image showing a bald Bard with a small mustache and beard, and bags under his eyes.\n\nThe identity of the man in the portrait was lost over the centuries -- until Alec Cobbe saw a portrait from Washington's Folger Shakespeare Library. That painting, which fell into disfavor as a Shakespeare portrait about 70 years ago, turned out to be one of four copies of Cobbe's portrait.\n\nThe portrait \"shows a man wearing expensive costuming, including a very beautifully painted ruff of Italian lacework which would have been very expensive,\" Wells said.\n\n\"It establishes, for me, that Shakespeare in his later years was a rather wealthy, a rather well affluent member of aristocratic circles in the society of his time,\" Wells said.\n\n\"There's been too much of a tendency to believe that Shakespeare, being the son of a glover, coming for a small town in the middle of England, that he necessarily retained a rather humble status throughout his life.\"\n\nWells reads even more into what he sees in Shakespeare's newly-found face.\n\n\"I think it's plausible as a portrait as a good listener, of somebody who would have been capable of writing the plays, clearly the face of a man of high intelligence,\" he said.\n\n\"It's the face of a man, I think, who betrays a good deal of wisdom in his features. But, of course, as somebody (King Duncan) says in Shakespeare's story Macbeth, 'there's no art to find the mind's construction in the face.'\"\n\nIt should be noted that Shakespeare's King Duncan paid a price for judging Macbeth to have the face of an honorable man. Macbeth later murdered the king.\n\nThe public can read Shakespeare's face from the original painting at Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in Stratford-upon-Avon where it goes on display for several months starting April 23.\n\nThe portrait then returns to the Cobbe family, which inherited it when an ancestor married England's Earl of Southampton -- a friend of Shakespeare who likely commissioned its painting.", "parametric_answer": "night watch", "parametric_answer_freq": 5, "parametric_evidencde": "The given answers can be grouped as follows based on their semantic similarity:\n\n1.

At one stage, she was going to leave the show. So, fortunately, we've calmed everything down.\"  Watch how Boyle may be feeling the pressure »\n\n\n\nBoyle said that that she has put the tumultuous week behind her and is getting ready for the finale.\n\n\n\n\"It's all I've been thinking about,\" she said on the show's Web site. \"I'm not going to throw away my big chance now.\"\n\n\n\n\"Britain's Got Talent\" defended Boyle on its Web site, saying that media reports of an emotional outburst \"have been taken out of context.\"\n\n\n\nThe unemployed charity worker has inspired millions in the face of pop music's penchant for pre-processed princesses.\n\n\n\nBefore she sang during her audition, the unassuming single woman with a loose mop of curly hair drew snickers from the audience, including notoriously hard-to-please judge Simon Cowell.\n\n\n\nThe scowls and eye-rolling were replaced by wild cheers as soon as she sang the first line.\n\n\n\nCowell later apologized for poking fun at her during the auditions stage.\n\n\n\n\"You are one special lady,\" he said last week. \"You really are.\"\n\n\n\nReporters made their way to her quiet home in Blackburn, West Lothian, Scotland, much to Boyle's great surprise.\n\n\n\n\"I keep my feet firmly planted on the ground, because you have to,\" Boyle told CNN last month.\n\n\n\nAsked what has been the most surprising change since her audition, she responded simply -- \"The way everyone seems to have embraced me.

Watch Goldman describe his fight to get his son back »\n\n\n\nMother and son never returned. Instead, Bianchi stayed in Brazil, where she divorced Goldman and married a Brazilian lawyer.\n\n\n\nBut in September, Bianchi's death during childbirth led Goldman to renew his efforts to regain custody of their son.\n\n\n\nSean, who has been living with his half-sister and his stepfather, was to have spent a 30-day adaptation period in the United States before his father gained full custody.\n\n\n\nThat prospect sparked outrage from an attorney representing the boy's Brazilian relatives. \"The child wasn't heard,\" lawyer Sergio Tostes said. \"The child said many times that he wanted to stay in Brazil. This is not human, and it is a cruelty.\"\n\n\n\nThe case has attracted high-level attention.

{"question": "What does Obama revive?", "answers": ["system of military trials"], "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama on Friday resumed -- with expanded legal protections -- the Bush administration's controversial system of military trials for some Guantanamo Bay detainees.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama says the commissions are OK, \"provided that they are properly structured and administered.\"\n\n\n\nOn the heels of Obama's shift this week to block the release of photos showing prisoners allegedly being abused by U.S. personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan, the military commissions announcement further infuriated the president's most ardent supporters while winning cautionary praise from some of his political foes.\n\n\n\nObama said he supports the idea of the military commissions but opposes the version of the law that had been governing such trials in recent years: the Military Commissions Act put in place under the Bush administration in 2006, but subsequently struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nThe president said military commissions \"are appropriate for trying enemies who violate the laws of war, provided that they are properly structured and administered.\" But, he said, the 2006 act \"failed to establish a legitimate legal framework and undermined our capability to ensure swift and certain justice against those detainees.\"\n\n\n\nHe said he plans to enhance due process rights for detainees held at the U.S. facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in order to improve the widely criticized approach created by his predecessor.\n\n\n\nStatements that have been obtained from detainees through interrogation and cruel treatment, such as waterboarding, will no longer be admitted as evidence before the commissions, Obama said, and hearsay evidence will be limited.\n\n\n\nThe revised system also will give detainees greater latitude in selecting legal representation and afford basic protections to those who refuse to testify. Military commission judges also will be able to establish the jurisdiction of their own courts.\n\n\n\n\"These reforms will begin to restore the commissions as a legitimate forum for prosecution, while bringing them in line with the rule of law,\" Obama said.\n\n\n\nHe said he plans to ask Congress to enact other reforms to the 2006 law.\n\n\n\nSen.

Romero, the group's executive director.\n\n\n\n\"Tweaking the rules of these failed tribunals so that they provide 'more due process' is absurd; there is no such thing as 'due process light.' \" he said. \"If the administration's proposed rules really bring these proceedings in line with constitutional requirements, there is no reason not to use our tried and true justice system. If they don't, these tribunals have no place in our democracy.\"\n\n\n\nWhite House spokesman Robert Gibbs countered that military commissions have a long history in the United States.\n\n\n\n\"First and foremost, the president of the United States is going to do what he believes is in the best security interest of the people of the United States,\" Gibbs told reporters.\n\n\n\nObama suspended the military commissions by signing an executive order on his third day in office, the same day he signed an order to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo within a year and announced a 120-day review of the whole process.

{"question": "who are growing?", "answers": ["friends"], "context": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- John and Elizabeth Calvert enjoyed the good life on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina, friends said, but they were growing more and more suspicious of the way their business books were being handled. Things weren't adding up. Money appeared to be missing.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn and Elizabeth Calvert are featured on missing persons posters on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo they scheduled a meeting with accountant Dennis Ray Gerwing to address their concerns, recalled one close friend, Nancy Cappelmann.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Calverts said they were meeting with Gerwing at his offices in the upscale resort community at 6 p.m. last March 3, she added.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would be the last time anyone would see or hear from the couple.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Calverts lived part-time on their yacht, docked at the island's Harbor Town Yacht Basin, the same marina where they managed boat slips. They spent the rest of the year in Savannah, Georgia, and also had a home in Atlanta.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were an active, affluent couple in their mid-40s, and their absence was quickly noticed. On the evening of March 3, 2008, the evening they were to meet with their accountant, both of the Calverts' phones were turned off. Family members said it was very unusual for either John or Elizabeth Calvert to shut off their cell phones.   Watch an update on the case »\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily and friends called police and reported the Calverts missing on March 4, after they missed appointments and still couldn't be reached.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was supposed to meet John that night and he is never late, so when 20 minutes went by, I got worried and called his cell, but it went straight to voicemail, like it was turned off,\" Cappelmann said. She was a good friend of the couple's and worked at one of their harbor businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice and search teams scoured the island. Divers and dogs searched the harbor and found nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Calverts' small airplane was still at the island's airport and provided no clues. Their 2006 Mercedes Benz was found parked at a hotel in Palmetto Dunes, a gated community six miles from where the Calverts' yacht was docked. The Mercedes also contained no forensic clues.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn reconstructing the Calverts' last days, investigators concluded that Gerwing was worth a deeper look. They now say they believe the 54-year-old accountant was the last person to see the Calverts alive.\n\n\n\n\n\nGerwing ran the management company that kept the books on the Calverts' four businesses on Hilton Head Island. Authorities were already looking into possible financial improprieties involving the company, The Club Group.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey named Gerwing as a person of interest in the case about a week after the couple disappeared. An internal audit later revealed that Gerwing had embezzled $2.1 million from the Calverts and others, police said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGerwing committed suicide within hours of learning he was a person of interest, slashing his neck and legs with a steak knife, authorities said. He also left behind suicide notes with vague references to the Calvert case, said Beaufort County Sheriff P.J. Tanner.\n\n\n\n\n\nTanner said the notes indicated some acknowledgement of responsibility for his actions, but didn't say specifically what those actions might have been.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice also gathered circumstantial evidence that seemed to point to Gerwing, including drop cloths large enough to use to wrap bodies and latex gloves purchased on the day the Calverts disappeared.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, police learned that Gerwing's cell phone had been turned off for 12 hours after he was scheduled to meet with the Calverts.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Gerwing were alive, Tanner said, police wouldn't have enough corroborating evidence to name him a suspect and arrest him.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice executed search warrants on Gerwing's office, home and vehicles and found soil in Gerwing's kitchen. Investigators hope analysis of the dirt might provide clues to the origin of the dirt and a new location to continue searching for John and Elizabeth Calvert.\n\n\n\n\n\nFriends and family are offering a $65,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the Calverts' disappearance.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice urge anyone with information about John and Elizabeth Calvert", "parametric_answer": "children", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "Children"}
