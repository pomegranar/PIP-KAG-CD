{"question": "when did the royal mint move to wales", "answers": ["17 December 1968"], "context": "<P> Work on the new mint began in August 1967 with the construction of a blank treatment plant and plant for striking . This first phase of the mint was officially opened on 17 December 1968 by the royal attendance of Queen Elizabeth II , Prince Philip and their son Prince Charles . Originally there were fears that the Royal family would face protests because of the Investiture of Prince Charles as the Prince of Wales ; however , such protests failed to materialise . The second phase of construction began in 1973 and included the addition of a means to mint coins from virgin metals completing the full minting process . Upon completion the final cost for the land , buildings and plant came to £ 8 million . Coin minting and production gradually shifted to the new site over the next seven years until the last coin , a gold sovereign , was struck in London in November 1975 . In an attempt to consolidate all previous coin - related acts , the Coinage Act of 1971 was passed , which among other things effectively abolished the individual role of Master of the Mint .

Formed over 1,100 years ago , the mint was historically part of a series of mints that became centralised to produce coins for the Kingdom of England , all of Great Britain and eventually most of the British Empire . The original London mint from which the Royal Mint is the successor , was established in 886 AD and operated within the Tower of London for approximately 800 years before moving to what is now called Royal Mint Court where it remained until the 1960s . As Britain followed the rest of the world in decimalising its currency , the Mint moved from London to a new 38 acres ( 15 ha ) plant in Llantrisant , Wales where it has remained since . </P>", "parametric_answer": "1984", "parametric_answer_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "The Royal Mint moved from Tower Hill, London to Llantrisant, Wales in 1984.

{"question": "who was ursula the sea witch based on", "answers": ["American actor and drag queen Divine"], "context": "<P> During production of The Little Mermaid , Ursula 's design evolved and transformed dramatically . Animator Glen Keane 's earliest sketches of Ursula were drawn to resemble Rae , specifically based on the actress ' audition for the role . The short - lived casting of Stritch as Ursula and her subsequent performance eventually inspired the animators to design the character as `` a tall , thin regal - looking sea witch '' based on manta rays and scorpion fish , complete with a long cape . At one point , Ursula had also been drawn with spikes to resemble a spinefish . Ursula 's appearance was largely inspired by American actor and drag queen Divine , who was best known for his frequent appearances in several films directed by filmmaker John Waters . Similarities were first drawn between the character and the actor after animator Rob Minkoff sketched `` a vampy overweight matron '' , to which Ashman responded , `` She looks like a Miami Beach matron ... playing Mah Jong by the pool . '' The character shares Divine 's signature eye makeup , jewelry and body type while originally sporting a Mohawk , the last of which was borrowed from the actor 's Pink Flamingo s ( 1972 ) character Babs Johnson . However , Minkoff had been drawing the character with a shark 's tale at the time . Clements eventually decided to place Ursula 's head on top of the body of an octopus instead , which ultimately resulted in her current design . The animators then studied the way in which octopuses move , explaining , `` There was a very kind of seductive and yet scary aspect '' , which they incorporated into the character 's own gait . The Pink Flamingos - inspired Mohawk was ultimately discarded because Disney felt that the hairstyle was `` too over-the - top '' for the film . Additionally , Ursula 's face was also inspired by that of Madame Medusa from Disney 's The Rescuers ( 1977 ) . According to The Gospel according to Disney : Faith , Trust , and Pixie Dust author Mark I. Pinsky , Ursula became `` the most grotesque characterization Disney ... have created for a female villain '' at that time . </P>", "parametric_answer": "hans christian andersen", "parametric_answer_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "In the original fairy tale \"The Little Mermaid\" by Hans Christian Andersen, the sea witch who helps Ariel is unnamed"}

For example , beta decay of a neutron transforms it into a proton by the emission of an electron , or conversely a proton is converted into a neutron by the emission of a positron ( positron emission ) , thus changing the nuclide type . Neither the beta particle nor its associated neutrino exist within the nucleus prior to beta decay , but are created in the decay process . By this process , unstable atoms obtain a more stable ratio of protons to neutrons . The probability of a nuclide decaying due to beta and other forms of decay is determined by its nuclear binding energy .

Within months after the discovery of the neutron , Werner Heisenberg and Dmitri Ivanenko had proposed proton -- neutron models for the nucleus . Heisenberg 's landmark papers approached the description of protons and neutrons in the nucleus through quantum mechanics . While Heisenberg 's theory for protons and neutrons in the nucleus was a `` major step toward understanding the nucleus as a quantum mechanical system , '' he still assumed the presence of nuclear electrons . In particular , Heisenberg assumed the neutron was a proton -- electron composite , for which there is no quantum mechanical explanation . Heisenberg had no explanation for how lightweight electrons could be bound within the nucleus . Heisenberg introduced the first theory of nuclear exchange forces that bind the nucleons .

Most vertebrate species devote between 2 % and 8 % of basal metabolism to the brain . In primates , however , the percentage is much higher -- in humans it rises to 20 -- 25 % . The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time , but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions ; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET , fMRI , and NIRS .

{"question": "when was the minimum wage established in the united states", "answers": ["1912"], "context": "<P> In 1910 , in conjunction with advocacy work led by Florence Kelley of the National Consumer League , the Women 's Trade Union League ( WTLU ) of Massachusetts under the leadership of Elizabeth Evans took up the cause of minimum wage legislation in Massachusetts . Over the next two years , a coalition of social reform groups and labor advocates in Boston pushed for minimum wage legislation in the state . In 1912 , Massachusetts passed the first American minimum wage legislation , which established a state commission for recommending non-compulsory minimum wages for women and children . Within eight years , at least thirteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia would pass minimum wage laws , with pressure being placed on state legislatures by the National Consumers League in a coalition with other women 's voluntary associations and organized labor . The United States Supreme Court of the Lochner era consistently invalidated compulsory minimum wage laws . Advocates for these minimum wage laws hoped that they would be upheld under the precedent of Muller v. Oregon , which upheld maximum working hours laws for women on the grounds that women required special protection that men did not .

Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries , these amalgamated or were bought by competitors until only a handful of larger companies remained ( see railway mania ) . The entire network was brought under government control during the First World War and a number of advantages of amalgamation and planning were revealed . However , the government resisted calls for the nationalisation of the network . In 1923 , almost all the remaining companies were grouped into the `` big four '' , the Great Western Railway , the London and North Eastern Railway , the London , Midland and Scottish Railway and the Southern Railway .

When fluoride ions are present in plaque fluid along with dissolved hydroxyapatite , and the pH is higher than 4.5 , a fluorapatite - like remineralized veneer is formed over the remaining surface of the enamel ; this veneer is much more acid - resistant than the original hydroxyapatite , and is formed more quickly than ordinary remineralized enamel would be . The cavity - prevention effect of fluoride is mostly due to these surface effects , which occur during and after tooth eruption . Although some systemic ( whole - body ) fluoride returns to the saliva via blood plasma , and to unerupted teeth via plasma or crypt fluid , there is little data to determine what percentages of fluoride 's anticavity effect comes from these systemic mechanisms . Also , although fluoride affects the physiology of dental bacteria , its effect on bacterial growth does not seem to be relevant to cavity prevention . </P>", "parametric_answer": "enamel", "parametric_answer_freq": 4, "parametric_evidencde": "According to the American Dental Association, \"The highest concentration of fluoride is found in the enamel of the tooth\" (ADA.org"}

( The same code also required that women should place their hands over their hearts when the flag is displayed during the playing of the Anthem , but not if the flag was not present . ) On December 23 , 1942 the law was again revised instructing men and women to stand at attention and face in the direction of the music when it was played . That revision also directed men and women to place their hands over their hearts only if the flag was displayed . Those in uniform were required to salute . On July 7 , 1976 , the law was simplified . Men and women were instructed to stand with their hands over their hearts , men removing their hats , irrespective of whether or not the flag was displayed and those in uniform saluting . On August 12 , 1998 , the law was rewritten keeping the same instructions , but differentiating between `` those in uniform '' and `` members of the Armed Forces and veterans '' who were both instructed to salute during the playing whether or not the flag was displayed .

Zenger High as a freshman , along with his three best friends , Mitch , Patrick , and Kyle , and quickly realizes that it is very different from middle school . Upperclassmen are intimidating and will steal any lunch money along with loose change if you stand in the wrong place . Scott gets put in advanced classes , including an Honors English class which , despite the amount of homework , is his favorite class . His teacher , Mr. Franka , becomes a mentor to him . Scott finds out that he 's not in classes with his friends since he 's carrying all honors and college prep classes . He tries his best from the very start to get the attention of Julia Baskins , a girl who was in his kindergarten class and has recently become very beautiful over the summer . Because of her beauty she quickly blends in with the popular girls and is attracted to the football players who are often bullying Scott . Scott is also connected to another classmate named Louden , who is better known as Mouth . Scott tries every attempt to get Julia 's attention such as joining the school paper , because he thinks that she is part of the staff , only to discover that she has written only a single column for the paper . He then runs for student council , after finding out that Julia is also running as well , and wins a seat , only to find out that she has not won . Because of this , Scott resigns from his position on the student council . It turns out that a lot of other members also resigned including the president meaning Julia who happened to have the 2nd most amount of votes is now president . He also auditions for the school play and is selected as a member of the crew , thinking that Julia is also auditioning for the play . However , Julia has not been selected as a member of the cast or crew . Soon , a new girl named Lee arrives at school , who wears face pins and weird clothes , and has wildly colored hair . Both soon realize that they share the same interests , but he ca n't get past his crush on Julia . Scott suddenly has another `` friend '' named Wesley , a high school senior . Though they share some interests , they have little in common . Then to put the cherry on top of all this excitement going on in his life , his mother announces that she is pregnant . He copes with all of this by creating a tip book for his soon - to - be baby sibling to help him , or her , survive high school when they get to it . In his entries to the baby , he often shows disdain by using degrading terms to talk to it such as `` Smelly '' or `` Blob of unformed goo '' . But he writes it to be a good older brother to this new baby since Scott 's own brother was never very present . As time goes by , Scott tries to find his place , but he starts to lose his best friends . Mitch finds a girlfriend and soon forgets the group , Patrick moves to Texas , then to Japan , and Kyle joins the wrestling team and soon puts Scott down for having a crush on Julia . Soon , Julia 's boyfriend Vernon beats up Scott after finding out from Kyle ( who lost a fight with Scott ) that Scott has a crush on his girlfriend . Scott realizes that what a person says and does can affect the life of another after Mouth attempts to commit suicide . Later , he learns that not everything is what it seems once he finds out that his older brother , Bobby , who is struggling to find a job , can barely read . Scott 's mother eventually gives birth to a new baby boy , whom they name Sean . Meanwhile , Bobby finds a job through guitar - playing and Julia eventually starts dating a nicer guy , though she is now close to Scott enough to give him a kiss on the cheek . </P>", "parametric_answer": "princeton university", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "\"Sleeping Freshmen Never Lie\" is a book by Daniel Mendelsohn, a professor at Princeton University, which"}

Sherrington struggled to find a good term that emphasized a union between two separate elements , and the actual term `` synapse '' was suggested by the English classical scholar Arthur Woollgar Verrall , a friend of Michael Foster .

Midazolam is the most commonly prescribed for this use because of its strong sedative actions and fast recovery time , as well as its water solubility , which reduces pain upon injection .

As the music progresses , the pitches used may change and introduce a different scale . Music can be transposed from one scale to another for various purposes , often to accommodate the range of a vocalist . Such transposition raises or lowers the overall pitch range , but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale . For example , transposition from the key of C major to D major raises all pitches of the scale of C major equally by a whole tone . Since the interval relationships remain unchanged , transposition may be unnoticed by a listener , however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes the relationship of the overall pitch range compared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music .

South Dakota and Wyoming were the final two states to comply with the age 21 mandate . The current drinking age of 21 remains a point of contention among many Americans , because of it being higher than the age of majority ( 18 in most states ) and higher than the drinking ages of most other countries .

While other inventors had produced devices that could record sounds , Edison 's phonograph was the first to be able to reproduce the recorded sound . His phonograph originally recorded sound onto a tinfoil sheet wrapped around a rotating cylinder . A stylus responding to sound vibrations produced an up and down or hill - and - dale groove in the foil . Alexander Graham Bell 's Volta Laboratory made several improvements in the 1880s and introduced the graphophone , including the use of wax - coated cardboard cylinders and a cutting stylus that moved from side to side in a zig zag groove around the record . In the 1890s , Emile Berliner initiated the transition from phonograph cylinders to flat discs with a spiral groove running from the periphery to near the center , coining the term gramophone for disc record players , which is predominantly used in many languages .

It takes eight ( or perhaps 10 or more ) photons to utilize one molecule of CO . The Gibbs free energy for converting a mole of CO to glucose is 114 kcal , whereas eight moles of photons of wavelength 600 nm contains 381 kcal , giving a nominal efficiency of 30 % . However , photosynthesis can occur with light up to wavelength 720 nm so long as there is also light at wavelengths below 680 nm to keep Photosystem II operating ( see Chlorophyll ) .

For actual sunlight , where only 45 % of the light is in the photosynthetically active wavelength range , the theoretical maximum efficiency of solar energy conversion is approximately 11 % . In actuality , however , plants do not absorb all incoming sunlight ( due to reflection , respiration requirements of photosynthesis and the need for optimal solar radiation levels ) and do not convert all harvested energy into biomass , which results in an overall photosynthetic efficiency of 3 to 6 % of total solar radiation .

The first appearance of 中國 on an artifact was in the Western Zhou on a ritual vessel known as He zun .

Prior to the Qin unification of China `` Zhongguo '' referred to the `` Central States '' ; the connotation was the primacy of a culturally distinct core area , centered on the Yellow River valley , as distinguished from the tribal periphery . In later periods , however , `` Zhongguo '' was not used in this sense . Dynastic names were used for the state in Imperial China and concepts of the state aside from the ruling dynasty were little understood . Rather , the country was called by the name of the dynasty , such as `` Han dynasty '' ( Hanchao 漢 朝 ) , `` Tang dynasty '' ( Tangchao 唐 朝 ) , `` The Great Ming '' ( Daming 大明 ) , `` The Great Qing '' ( Daqing 大 清 ) , as the case might be .

Certain northern counties , like Durham and Cumberland , had been the victim of violent incursions from the Scots , and were therefore left particularly vulnerable to the devastations of the plague . Pestilence is less virulent during the winter months , and spreads less rapidly . The Black Death in England had survived the winter of 1348 -- 49 , but during the following winter it gave in , and by December 1349 conditions were returning to relative normalcy .

{"question": "where was the bridge in saving private ryan", "answers": ["over the Merderet in the fictional town of Ramelle"], "context": "<P> Running parallel to the shoreline about 5 miles ( 8.0 km ) from Utah Beach , the marshes of the Merderet and Douve formed a natural defensive line protecting the western end of the Allied landing zone and at the same time limiting the Allies ' potential to break out of the beachhead . Thus control of the bridges at Manoir de la Fière and Chef - du - Pont was seen as vital . The Merderet was assigned to the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division as Mission Boston , scheduled for 5 hours before the amphibious landings on D - Day . Cloud cover and German fire caused the landings to be dispersed ; the paratroopers took the strategic town of Sainte - Mère - Église but failed in their original mission to clear the west bank of the Merderet on D - Day and blow the bridge over the Douze at Pont l'Abbé ( now Étienville ) . The extent of their control of the bridges over the Merderet is disputed , but it was sufficient to hold off German counterattacks . These included an attack over the causeway at La Fiere by the 1057th Grenadier Regiment and light tanks of the 100th Panzer Replacement Battalion .

God gave Sarai the new name `` Sarah '' , and blessed her . Abraham was given assurance that Sarah would have a son . Not long afterwards , Abraham and Sarah were visited by three men . One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year , Sarah would have a son . While at the tent entrance , Sarah overheard what was said , and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages . The visitor inquired of Abraham why Sarah laughed at the idea of bearing a child , for her age was as nothing to God . Sarah soon became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham , at the very time which had been spoken . The patriarch , then a hundred years old , named the child `` Isaac '' ( Hebrew yitschaq , `` laughter '' ) and circumcised him when he was eight days old . For Sarah , the thought of giving birth and nursing a child , at such an old age , also brought her much laughter , as she declared , `` God had made me to laugh , ( so that ) all that hear will laugh with me . '' Abraham held a great feast on the day when Isaac was to be weaned . It was during this banquet that Sarah happened upon the then teenaged Ishmael mocking and was so disturbed that she requested that both he and Hagar be removed from their company . Abraham was initially distressed by this but relented when told by God to do as his wife had asked . </P>", "parametric_answer": "manoah", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "Judges 13:2-5 (Bible) - \"There was a certain man of Zorah, of"}

The Mughal emperors had roots in the Turco - Mongol Timurid dynasty of Central Asia , claiming direct descent from both Genghis Khan ( founder of the Mongol Empire , through his son Chagatai Khan ) and Timur ( Turco - Mongol conqueror who founded the Timurid Empire ) . During the reign of Humayun , the successor of Babur , the empire was briefly interrupted by the Sur Empire . The `` classic period '' of the Mughal Empire started in 1556 with the ascension of Akbar the Great to the throne . Under the rule of Akbar and his son Jahangir , the region enjoyed economic progress as well as religious harmony , and the monarchs were interested in local religious and cultural traditions . Akbar was a successful warrior who also forged alliances with several Hindu Rajput kingdoms . Some Rajput kingdoms continued to pose a significant threat to the Mughal dominance of northwestern India , but most of them were subdued by Akbar .

{"question": "what parts make up the peripheral nervous system", "answers": ["somatic nervous system", "autonomic nervous system"], "context": "<P> The peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) is one of the two components of the nervous system , the other part is the central nervous system ( CNS ) . The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands .

This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5 g or 27g of oxygen . 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1 : 2 , a ratio of small whole numbers .

The two men were unaware that forty years before , Japan and pre-revolutionary Russia had discussed sharing Korea along the same parallel . Rusk later said that had he known , he `` almost surely '' would have chosen a different line . The division placed sixteen million Koreans in the American zone and nine million in the Soviet zone .

The motions put forward on June 8 also sought to select Pedro Espada as Temporary President of the State Senate , which would have installed him as acting lieutenant governor . The Democrats have disputed the legitimacy of the motions put forward on June 8 . The New York State Senate has been providing a running update of the legal proceedings since June 11 , 2009 . The dispute ended July 9 , 2009 , when Senator Espada announced he would return to the Democratic caucus and take on the position of majority leader , while it was also announced that former majority leader Malcolm Smith had assumed the title of president pro tempore , and John Sampson would serve as Democratic conference leader with the understanding he would assume the presidency at an undetermined future date . Following the 2010 election and the Republican victory in the Senate , Senator Dean Skelos from Long Island served as both Temporary President and Majority Leader , but resigned in May 2015 in the midst of corruption charges . The current majority leader , or president , is John J.

The western coast of Australia had been discovered for Europeans by the Dutch explorer Willem Janszoon in 1606 and was later named New Holland by the Dutch East India Company , but there was no attempt to colonise it . In 1770 James Cook discovered the eastern coast of Australia while on a scientific voyage to the South Pacific Ocean , claimed the continent for Britain , and named it New South Wales . In 1778 , Joseph Banks , Cook 's botanist on the voyage , presented evidence to the government on the suitability of Botany Bay for the establishment of a penal settlement , and in 1787 the first shipment of convicts set sail , arriving in 1788 . Britain continued to transport convicts to New South Wales until 1840 .

{"question": "when did the dust bowl end in oklahoma", "answers": ["1940"], "context": "<P> The Dust Bowl , also known as the Dirty Thirties , was a period of severe dust storms that greatly damaged the ecology and agriculture of the American and Canadian prairies during the 1930s ; severe drought and a failure to apply dryland farming methods to prevent wind erosion ( the Aeolian processes ) caused the phenomenon . The drought came in three waves , 1934 , 1936 , and 1939 -- 1940 , but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years . With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains , farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade ; this had displaced the native , deep - rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds . The rapid mechanization of farm equipment , especially small gasoline tractors , and widespread use of the combine harvester contributed to farmers ' decisions to convert arid grassland ( much of which received no more than 10 inches ( 250 mm ) of precipitation per year ) to cultivated cropland . </P>", "parametric_answer": "1936", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "The Dust Bowl is generally considered to have ended in 1936 when a combination of factors, including a series of wet"}

Unalienable Rights are essential Limitations in all Governments . '' Hutcheson , however , placed clear limits on his notion of unalienable rights , declaring that `` there can be no Right , or Limitation of Right , inconsistent with , or opposite to the greatest publick Good . '' Hutcheson elaborated on this idea of unalienable rights in his A System of Moral Philosophy ( 1755 ) , based on the Reformation principle of the liberty of conscience . One could not in fact give up the capacity for private judgment ( e.g. , about religious questions ) regardless of any external contracts or oaths to religious or secular authorities so that right is `` unalienable .

Their relationship is seemingly summarized in `` A.A.R.M.

Angela later tells Michael what happened , but still does n't reveal their relationship . In `` Fun Run '' Angela asks Dwight to feed her cat Sprinkles , who is feeling sick , but Dwight kills it , which causes Angela to break up with him .

{"question": "when did they start assigning social security numbers at birth", "answers": ["1990"], "context": "<P> Before 1986 , people often did not obtain a Social Security number until the age of about 14 , since the numbers were used for income tracking purposes , and those under that age seldom had substantial income . The Tax Reform Act of 1986 required parents to list Social Security numbers for each dependent over the age of 5 for whom the parent wanted to claim a tax deduction . Before this act , parents claiming tax deductions were simply trusted not to lie about the number of children they supported . During the first year of the Tax Reform Act , this anti-fraud change resulted in seven million fewer minor dependents being claimed . The disappearance of these dependents is believed to have involved either children who never existed or tax deductions improperly claimed by non-custodial parents . In 1988 , the threshold was lowered to 2 years old , and in 1990 , the threshold was lowered yet again to 1 year old . Today , an SSN is required regardless of the child 's age to receive an exemption . Since then , parents have often applied for Social Security numbers for their children soon after birth ; today , it can be done on the application for a birth certificate . </P>", "parametric_answer": "1936", "parametric_answer_freq": 3, "parametric_evidencde": "The Social Security Administration (SSA) started assigning Social Security numbers to children at birth in 1936.

Gustav Bauer , the head of the new government , sent a telegram stating his intention to sign the treaty if certain articles were withdrawn , including Articles 227 , 230 and 231 .

On 28 June 1919 , the fifth anniversary of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand ( the immediate impetus for the war ) , the peace treaty was signed .

{"question": "who in germany signed the treaty of versailles", "answers": ["Foreign minister Hermann Müller", "colonial minister Johannes Bell"], "context": "<P> After Scheidemann ′ s resignation , a new coalition government was formed under Gustav Bauer . President Friedrich Ebert knew that Germany was in an impossible situation . Although he shared his countrymen 's disgust with the treaty , he was sober enough to consider the possibility that the government would not be in a position to reject it . He believed that if Germany refused to sign the treaty , the Allies would invade Germany from the west -- and there was no guarantee that the army would be able to make a stand in the event of an invasion . With this in mind , he asked Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg if the army was capable of any meaningful resistance in the event the Allies resumed the war . If there was even the slightest chance that the army could hold out , Ebert intended to recommend against ratifying the treaty . Hindenburg -- after prodding from his chief of staff , Wilhelm Groener -- concluded the army could not resume the war even on a limited scale . However , rather than inform Ebert himself , he had Groener inform the government that the army would be in an untenable position in the event of renewed hostilities . Upon receiving this , the new government recommended signing the treaty . The National Assembly voted in favour of signing the treaty by 237 to 138 , with five abstentions ( there were 421 delegates in total ) . This result was wired to Clemenceau just hours before the deadline . Foreign minister Hermann Müller and colonial minister Johannes Bell travelled to Versailles to sign the treaty on behalf of Germany .

Dean takes this as proof that Jack will turn evil , while Sam thinks it 's because he lacks control . Meanwhile , the final Prince of Hell , Asmodeus , takes charge of Hell until Lucifer returns , disguising himself as Donatello to trick Jack into freeing the Shedim -- Hell 's darkest creatures -- to be a hero .

The poem was published under the title `` The Chariot '' . It is composed in six quatrains with the meter alternating between iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter . Stanzas 1 , 2 , 4 , and 6 employ end rhyme in their second and fourth lines , but some of these are only close rhyme or eye rhyme . In the third stanza , there is no end rhyme , but `` ring '' in line 2 rhymes with `` gazing '' and `` setting '' in lines 3 and 4 respectively . Internal rhyme is scattered throughout . Figures of speech include alliteration , anaphora , paradox , and personification . The poem personifies Death as a gentleman caller who takes a leisurely carriage ride with the poet to her grave . She also personifies immortality . The volta ( turn ) happens in the fourth quatrain . Structurally , the syllables shift from its constant 8 - 6 - 8 - 6 scheme to 6 - 8 - 8 - 6 . This parallels with the undertones of the sixth quatrain . The personification of death changes from one of pleasantry to one of ambiguity and morbidity : `` Or rather -- He passed Us -- / The Dews drew quivering and chill -- '' ( 13 - 14 ) .
