{"question": "Which musician founded the Red Hot Peppers?", "answers": ["jelly roll morton"], "context": "Red Hot PeppersRed Hot Peppers was a recording jazz band led by Jelly Roll Morton from 1926–1930.  It was a seven- or eight-piece band formed in Chicago that recorded for Victor and featured the best New Orleans-style freelance musicians available, including cornetist George Mitchell, trombonist Kid Ory, clarinetists Omer Simeon and Johnny Dodds, banjoists Johnny St. Cyr and Bud Scott, double bass player John Lindsay, and drummers Andrew Hilaire and Baby Dodds.  \n Recordings made by the group in Chicago in 1926–27, such as \"Black Bottom Stomp\", \"Smoke-House Blues\" and \"Doctor Jazz\" set a standard for small group jazz that is still unrivaled.  Morton's skills as a composer and arranger are apparent in the structure of the pieces, which combines clarity with variety and manages to maintain a balance between ensemble and solo playing while allowing for a substantial solo from every band member.  The quality of the recordings is further enhanced by the band's careful rehearsals, which were uncommon in early jazz performances.  A number of Morton's best piano solos can also be heard on these recordings.  \n In 1928, Morton moved to New York, where he continued to make recordings under the name Red Hot Peppers, but collaborated with musicians from his regular band or from other orchestras.  By 1930, the name Red Hot Peppers was no longer used. \n Recordings made by the Red Hot Peppers constituted a significant contribution to the race records industry, at its height in the 1920s and 1930s.

If you factor in her work as the lead singer of the Supremes in the 1960s, she may be the most successful. With her friends Mary Wilson , Florence Ballard, and Barbara Martin , Ross formed the Primettes vocal quartet in 1959. In 1960, they were signed to local Motown Records, changing their name to the Supremes in 1961. Martin then left, and the group continued as a trio. Over the next eight years, the Supremes (renamed \" Diana Ross and the Supremes \" in 1967, when Cindy Birdsong replaced Ballard) scored 12 number one pop hits. After the last one, \"Someday We'll Be Together\" (October 1969), Ross launched a solo career. \n Motown initially paired her with writer/producers Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson , who gave her four Top 40 pop hits, including the number one \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" (July 1970). Ross branched out into acting, starring in a film biography of Billie Holiday , Lady Sings the Blues (November 1972). The soundtrack went to number one, and Ross was nominated for an Academy Award. \n She returned to record-making with the Top Ten album Touch Me in the Morning (June 1973) and its chart-topping title song. This was followed by a duet album with Marvin Gaye , Diana & Marvin (October 1973), that produced three chart hits. Ross acted in her second movie, Mahogany (October 1975), and it brought her another chart-topping single in the theme song, \"Do You Know Where You're Going To.\" That and her next number one, the disco-oriented \"Love Hangover\" (March 1976), were featured on her second album to be titled simply Diana Ross (February 1976), which rose into the Top Ten. \n Ross' third film role came in The Wiz (October 1978). The Boss (May 1979) was a gold-selling album, followed by the platinum-selling Diana (May 1980) (the second of her solo albums with that name, though the other, a 1971 TV soundtrack, had an exclamation mark). It featured the number one single \"Upside Down\" and the Top Ten hit \"I'm Coming Out.\" \n Ross scored a third Top Ten hit in 1980 singing the title theme from the movie It's My Turn. She then scored the biggest hit of her career with another movie theme, duetting with Lionel Richie on \"Endless Love\" (June 1981). It was her last big hit on Motown; after more than 20 years, she decamped for RCA. She was rewarded immediately with a million-selling album, titled after her remake of the old Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers hit, \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love,\" which became her next Top Ten hit. The album also included the Top Ten hit \"Mirror, Mirror.\" \n Silk Electric (October 1982) was a gold-seller, featuring the Top Ten hit \"Muscles,\" written and produced by Michael Jackson , and Swept Away (September 1984) was another successful album, containing the hit \"Missing You,\" but Ross had trouble selling records in the second half of the 1980s. By 1989, she had returned to Motown, and by 1993 was turning more to pop standards, notably on the concert album Diana Ross Live: The Lady Sings...Jazz & Blues, Stolen Moments (April 1993). \n Motown released a four-CD/cassette box set retrospective, Forever Diana, in October 1993, and the singer published her autobiography in 1994.

He quit school at the age of 17 to join the Navy. His naval career was ended following a motorcycle accident while on shore leave in 1955. Shortly thereafter he heard an up and coming singer named Elvis Presley and decided on a singing career of his own. His excellent voice helped to hook him up with Norfolk disk jockey Tex Davis who pushed him through to Capitol Records where he recorded the million selling Be-Bop-A-Lula in 1956. While his first record earned him several movie appearances including The Girl Can't Help It (1956) and Hot Rod Gang (1958) and helped him to get a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, his success was short lived. His original Blue Caps band broke up fairly quickly and his fame in America dwindled as rebellious rockers of the 1950s were replaced by clean cut teen idols of the early 1960s. Vincent moved to Britain where he was a cult figure in 1959 and remained there for a decade when he returned to America in 1969 with a new record deal and enjoyed a brief revival amongst the hippy teenagers in California who revered him as a legend. His new found fame was cut short by his death on October 12, 1971 at the age of 36 years following complications of a bleeding ulcer and seizure.

His 1956 top ten hit with his Blue Caps, \"Be-Bop-A-Lula\", is considered a significant early example of rockabilly. He is a member of both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. \n Biography \n Early life \n Vincent Eugene Craddock was born in Norfolk, Virginia. His musical influences included country, rhythm and blues and gospel music. He showed his first real interest in music while his family lived in Munden Point, Princess Anne County (now Virginia Beach), Virginia, near the North Carolina line, where they ran a country store. He received his first guitar at the age of twelve as a gift from a friend. \n His father, Ezekiah Jackson Craddock, volunteered to serve in the U.S. Coast Guard and patrolled American coastal waters to protect Allied shipping against German U-boats during World War II. His mother, Mary Louise Craddock, maintained a general store at Munden Point. Craddock's parents moved the family and opened a general store and sailors' tailoring shop in Norfolk. \n Having spent his youth in the Norfolk area, Craddock dropped out of school at seventeen and enlisted in the United States Navy in 1952. Craddock's parents signed the forms allowing him to join the Navy. He completed boot camp and joined the fleet as a crewman aboard the fleet oiler  although he spent two weeks training period in the repair ship  before returning to the Chukawan. Craddock never saw combat but completed a Korean War deployment.

Taylor , University of Georgia, \n 08/15/2003 \n Last edited by  NGE Staff  on 10/12/2016 \n Georgia's peach industry has a long tradition. The first peaches were planted in the state in the eighteenth century, \n Peaches \n and the first commercial production occurred in the mid-nineteenth century. In 2014 Georgia ranked third nationally in peach production, behind California and South Carolina. That year, Georgia produced 35,500 tons of peaches.  \n Franciscan monks introduced peaches to St. Simons and Cumberland islands along Georgia's coast in 1571. By the mid-1700s peaches and plums were cultivated by the Cherokee Indians . Before the Civil War (1861-65) increasing \n Peach Harvest \n numbers of home orchards also were planted. Raphael Moses , a planter and Confederate officer from Columbus , was among the first to market peaches within Georgia in 1851 and is credited with being the first to ship and sell peaches successfully outside of the South. His method of shipping peaches in champagne baskets, rather than in pulverized charcoal, helped to preserve the flavor of the fruit and contributed to his success. Peach acreage expanded considerably in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, resulting in an all-time high production of almost 8 million bushels by 1928. Since then production has decreased to about 2.6 million bushels annually. \n Georgia enjoys important production and marketing advantages, primarily its proximity to eastern markets and favorable prices because of early harvests and high-quality fruit production. Nearly all peaches grown in Georgia are sold in the wholesale fresh market, with a small percentage sold at roadside markets. There is no significant peach processing in Georgia. \n The first Georgia peaches were shipped to the New York market between 1858 and 1860. They were transported by wagon to Augusta , then by shallow-draft boat to Savannah , and finally by steamship to New York. Georgia earned its \"Peach State\" designation during the three decades following the Civil War. \n Peach expansion in acreage and production was fueled by several factors. The abolition of slavery forced farmers to search for alternatives to the traditional labor-intensive cotton crop. Peaches in particular benefited from this transition. In 1870 Samuel H. Rumph, a Marshallville peach grower, \n Thomaston Peaches, ca. 1920 \n discovered a new peach variety, which he named Elberta for his wife. This yellow-fleshed peach was of superior quality and shipped better than previous varieties. Elberta remained the leading peach in Georgia until 1960, but newer varieties, for example J. H. Hale and Belle, have since replaced the Elberta in commercial use. (Georgia now produces more than forty commercial varieties.) \n Improvements in rail transportation and the development of the refrigerated rail car by Rumph allowed rapid shipments to northern markets on a large scale. Also the Georgia State Horticultural Society, founded near Augusta in 1876, promoted the introduction and testing of many fruit varieties and their distribution throughout the state while under the leadership of Prosper J. A. Berckmans, a nurseryman and pomologist. The old Berckmans Nursery is now the site of the Augusta National Golf Club, home to the annual Masters Tournament . \n Georgia Peach Orchard \n counties along the fall line , the transition zone between Georgia's Piedmont and Coastal Plain . This area is far enough north to receive sufficient winter chilling, but far enough south to avoid late frosts and guarantee early harvest dates. The early harvest allows premium prices for the crop. Additionally, the sandy loam soils of the fall line are more favorable to peach production than the Piedmont's heavy clays or the Coastal Plain's sands. \n There is a small commercial presence in Brooks and Pierce counties in south Georgia, where new varieties suitable for those areas are improving fruit quality. The new varieties seem to be responsible for a surge in the planting of peaches in this region of the state. Historically, considerable peach production occurred in north Georgia also, but during the 1980s and 1990s acreage declined because of frequent freeze damage and relatively late harvest dates. \n You Might Also Like  Georgia Peach CouncilGeorgia Peach Council \n Welcome to our Georgia Peaches website.  How sweet of you to drop by for", "parametric_answer": "ty cobb", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

The gritty left-hander leaped to prominence in 1974, using his overpowering two-handed backhand stroke to win three Grand Slam tournaments. Connors ended his career with a men's open–era record 109 singles titles and 1,337 victories, along with eight Grand Slam singles titles. \n Early Years \n James Scott Connors Jr. was born on September 2, 1952, in East St. Louis, Illinois, to James Sr. and Gloria Connors. A former professional tennis player, Gloria cleared land behind their house to build a court when she was pregnant with her younger son. Along with her mother, Bertha Thompson, known as \"Two Mom,\" Gloria taught Connors what would become his feared two-handed backhand shot and instilled in him a ferocious competitive drive. \n At 16, Connors began training with erstwhile champion Pancho Segura. He enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles, for one year and won the NCAA singles title, then dropped out to turn professional. \n Professional Career \n Connors quickly developed a reputation as a maverick among his peers. He refused to join the Association of Tennis Professionals union, opting to play in independent tournaments organized by his manager, Bill Riordan. He also became known for spewing profanities on the court, shocking the fans of what was considered a gentleman's game, and was mocked for his close relationship with his mother. \n However, there was no denying his ability to pulverize a tennis ball with the unusual steel racket he favored. Connors leapt into public view when he outlasted former Wimbledon champion Arthur Ashe in five sets to win the U.S. Pro Singles title in 1973. The left-hander had a season for the ages in 1974, winning the three Grand Slam tournaments he entered (Australian Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open) and accumulating a staggering overall 99-4 record in match play. He became the sport's No. 1-ranked male player that July, a distinction he held for 159 consecutive weeks. \n Over the next decade, Connors continued to dominate opponents with his deadly service return and two-handed backhand. He won four more U.S. Open singles titles—on three different surfaces—as well as the 1982 Wimbledon men's championship. He also claimed several \"winner take all\" matches against contemporary stars such as Ilie Nastase and aging champions such as Rod Laver. \n The gritty veteran earned his final tournament victory in 1989, at the Tel Aviv Open, but his last hurrah in the spotlight came during the 1991 U.S. Open. Connors rallied from two sets down against Patrick McEnroe in the first round and again against Aaron Krickstein in the fourth, on his 39th birthday, before falling to Jim Courier in the semifinals. \n Connors played one more full season in 1992 and his final ATP match in 1996, though he never officially retired from the sport. In addition to his men's open–era record 109 singles titles and 1,337 victories, Connors accumulated eight Grand Slam singles and two more doubles championships. He held the No. 1 ranking for a total of 268 weeks in his career, and at one point was ranked in the top 10 for an amazing 16 consecutive years. \n Personal Life \n Connors dated American tennis star Chris Evert in the early 1970s, but they called off their engagement in November 1974. Connors later married former Playboy Playmate Patti McGuire, with whom he has two children, Brett and Aubree. \n The hard-hitting champion was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1998. In January 2007, his beloved mother died at the age of 82. \n Connors made waves with the May 2013 release of his autobiography, The Outsider: A Memoir.

It featured a long-running romance between a reserved      Britisher and confirmed bachelor (Hugh Grant) and attractive American      (Andie MacDowell), with a hilarious bit-part by Rowan Atkinson (aka Mr.      Bean). Writer-director Scott Hicks' Australian/UK film Shine (1996) told the story of recovering gifted pianist David Helfgott (Best Actor-winning      Geoffrey Rush) with a history of mental problems. Due to the film's popularity,      the real-life Helfgott went on a musical concert tour, but received mostly      negative reviews. \n The decade's most successful British film was first-time        director Peter Cattaneo's Best Picture-nominated The Full Monty (1997) about a group of displaced, unemployed Sheffield steel-mill workers who        become 'Chippendale-style' male strippers. It brought new popularity to        two hits: Hot Chocolate's \"You Sexy Thing,\" and Donna Summers' \"Hot Stuff.\" The edgy and visually-fresh film about drug addiction, Trainspotting (1995) was based upon Irving Welsh's famous novel        set in Edinburgh, with original Scottish characters (and unknown actors)        including Renton, Spud, Sick Boy and Begbie, and featuring a pulsing soundtrack        with Iggy Pop singing \"Lust for Life\". Although not a British        film, Rob Roy (1995) starred Liam Neeson as 18th century Scottish        legend Robert Roy MacGregor based upon Sir Walter Scott's legendary novel. \n Distinctive Independent Film-Makers: \n In the 90s' era of blockbusters, independent films made            significant headway. The major studios set up specialty art-house production            and distribution divisions, such as Sony Pictures Classics and Fox World Cinema. There were any number of shoestring-budget, non-mainstream            films that appealed to disenchanted Generation-Xers, from directors such            as Richard Linklater, Kevin Smith, Edward Burns, Todd Solondz, Gus Van            Sant and Jim Jarmusch. \n Richard Linklater \n Writer/director                Richard Linklater's first feature Slacker (1991) was a free-form,                low-budget film that defined a generation of dead-beat, drop-out, misfit                individuals living on the edge of the college town of Austin, Texas during                a 24-hour period. [Many of Linklater's films would be contained within                a 24-hour time frame.] The word 'slacker' was immediately seized upon                as a word to define a group within the twenty-something subculture. His                next film, a rambling ensemble drama Dazed and Confused (1993),                dubbed 'the American Graffiti (1973) of                the 90s', followed graduating Texas high-school students on their last                academic day in the Bicentennial year of 1976. The quotable, archetypal                film introduced many exceptional acting newcomers to audiences, including                Milla Jovovich, Ben Affleck, Parker Posey, Renee Zellweger, Matthew McConaughey, Cole Hauser, Adam Goldberg, and Joey Lauren Adams. \n Linklater's more accessible and sweet film Before                  Sunrise (1995) followed the overnight budding romance between a traveling                  young American (Ethan Hawke) and a French student (Julie Delpy) in Vienna,                  and the dialogue-heavy SuBurbia (1997), an adaptation of writer/actor                  Eric Bogosian's play, examined a group of punk twenty-somethings outside                  a suburban Austin convenience store. In the new decade, Linklater's innovative                  6th film, Waking Life (2001) combined digital video and animation                  to produce a highly philosophical avant-garde film. \n Kevin Smith: The Jersey Trilogy \n Writer/director                      Kevin Smith's first film (the first in a so-called", "parametric_answer": "dirty dancing", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

Blood + boobs + strong female lead = the perfect combination to direct The Silence of the Lambs, a film about a man who kidnaps and skins women and the female FBI agent pursuing him. The Silence of the Lambs made Demme a household name and earned him an Academy Award for Best Director. But Demme didn't forget his roots. Roger Corman, who gave Demme his first directed role on Caged Heat, cameos as the FBI director in Lambs. ( Source ) \n Demme had previously directed Married to the Mob (1988) starring Michelle Pfeiffer, and wanted Pfeiffer to star as Starling in Silence, but she didn't want to be in a film so violent ( source ). So the studio selected Foster, who soon impressed Demme with her presence and her accent. \n Demme, Hopkins, Foster, and screenwriter Ted Tally made the perfect team. You'd think they'd all be back for the sequel, Hannibal, almost a decade later. But Demme read the novel and was \"horrified,\"  not in a good way. He passed on that project, which was picked up by Ridley Scott ( Alien , Blade Runner ). \n Since then, Demme has directed many other films, but only one featuring a sadistic sociopath who just might be a cannibalistic serial killer: Rachel Getting Married (2008) starring Anne Hathaway.  The Silence of the Lambs (film)The Silence of the Lambs is a 1991 American psychological horror-thriller film directed by Jonathan Demme and starring Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, and Scott Glenn.  It is the sequel to the 1986 film Manhunter.  The film is based on Thomas Harris' 1988 novel of the same name, his second to feature Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer. In the film, Clarice Starling, a young U.S. FBI trainee, seeks the advice of the imprisoned Dr. Lecter to apprehend another serial killer, known only as \"Buffalo Bill\". \n The Silence of the Lambs was released on February 14, 1991, and grossed $272.7 million worldwide against its $19 million budget. It was only the third film, the other two being It Happened One Night and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, to win Academy Awards in all the top five categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Adapted Screenplay. It is also the first (and so far only) Best Picture winner widely considered to be a horror film, and only the third such film to be nominated in the category, after The Exorcist in 1973 and Jaws in 1975.  The film is considered \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant by the U.S. Library of Congress and was selected to be preserved in the National Film Registry in 2011.

In 1990, when he was 19 years and 28 days old, Sampras became the youngest US Open men’s singles champion in history, defeating his career-rival Andre Agassi, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2. Twelve years later, Sampras ended his record-breaking career at the US Open, winning his fifth singles title at his home major and fourth overall against Agassi, 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4. In between those 12 years, Sampras carved out a place in history with a then-record 14 major singles titles (since tied by Rafael Nadal and passed by Roger Federer with 17), and unequivocally placed his name among the best ever to wield a racquet. \n Sampras wasn’t an overnight success, it took two arduous years taking his lumps on the professional tour to round into a big-serving, big match player, but when he retired a 14-time major champion (seven Wimbledon titles, five US Open championships, two Australian Open victories), he was regarded worldwide as the consummate champion who won 14 of 18 finals, a 78 percent winning mark, best in history. His seven Wimbledon and five US Open titles are tied for best all-time. Sampras compiled a 762-222 career singles record, top-10 all-time, and captured 64 tour singles titles in 265 overall tournaments (was a finalist in 24 tournaments), fifth best all-time. In a five-year span of tour domination from 1993 through 1998, Sampras held a stranglehold on the ATP year-end rankings, finishing the year as the world’s No. 1 player six consecutive years, a record that he still holds. Jimmy Connors had held that distinction for five years (1974-78). \n In comparison to his flamboyant and flashy nemesis Agassi, who Sampras faced 34 times in his career (winning 20 matches and defeating his rival in four of five major finals), Sampras was all-business on court. “I let my racquet do the talking,” he consistently told the media when asked why he wasn’t more colorful on court. “That’s what I am all about, really. I just go out and win tennis matches. I never wanted to be the great guy or the colorful guy or the interesting guy. I wanted to be the guy who won matches.” \n Until Sampras won his 13th major title, Aussie Roy Emerson held – since 1967 – the record for men’s single major wins with 12. When Sampras defeated Agassi to win the 2002 US Open, Sampras became the fifth oldest champion in history at 31 years, 27 days, and the oldest since his idol Rod Laver (31 years, 1 month) in 1969. \n The Potomac, Maryland native groomed his game in Rancho Palos Verdes, California at the Jack Kramer Tennis Club. In a five-year span starting in 1985 he went from 5-foot-5 to 6-foot tall and refined his game immensely, abandoning his two-handed backhand for a one-hander and ditching his wooden racquet for the new graphite technology. He turned professional at age 16 in 1988, launching his career as the No. 893 ranked player in the world. He broke into the top 100 by year end, but his first three years playing in major events didn’t produce the kind of results that would indicate future stardom.

Columbus: The Arch City is the state capital and also Ohio's most heavily populated city. It is the third largest Midwestern city in the United States with a population of 822,553 according to 2013 estimates. Columbus is home to the Ohio State University, which is the state's flagship institution of higher education. It is also a noted hub for independent art. \n 2. Cleveland: On the shores of Lake Erie, Cleveland is a destination for legions of music lovers. It houses the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, a museum that showcases the history of that music genre along with notable past and present rock and roll musicians. Cleveland is also the birthplace of Standard Oil. John D. Rockefeller founded his company there in 1870. It has remained an important manufacturing center since that time. \n 3. Cincinnati: The third largest city in Ohio was the first American city founded after the Revolutionary War, in 1788. Less than a century later, it earned the distinction of being the first place to establish a pro baseball team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, in 1869. Cincinnati was once known as the Paris of America because of historic architecture dating back to the 1800s. \n VOTE NOW: Should the Government Be Doing More to Promote Tourism in America? \n 4. Toledo: The Glass City earned its namesake after it emerged as the center of the glass industry in the early 20th century. Many large glass companies started in Toledo and the Toledo Museum of Art houses a collection of all different types of glass. The city became iconic in popular culture as a result of the TV Series M*A*S*H* in the 1970s and early 1980s. Corporal Maxwell Klinger, played by actor Jaime Farr, was a Toledo resident in the series before being drafted into the Korean War. \n 5. Akron: Much like the glass industry defined Toledo, the rubber industry has defined Akron. Ohio's fifth largest city became the Rubber Capital of the World in the early 20th century after several large tire companies set up headquarters and opened manufacturing plants within the city. Akron has had an influence on what people eat for breakfast as well as transportation. The forerunner to the Quaker Oats Company, F. Schumacher Milling Company, was founded in Akron in the 1880s.

Subways are usually built under city streets for ease of construction, but they may take shortcuts and sometimes must pass under rivers. Outlying sections of the system usually emerge aboveground, becoming conventional railways or elevated transit lines. Subway trains are usually made up of a number of cars operated on the multiple-unit system. \n The Metro Center Station in the Washington, D.C., subway, opened 1976 \n Stuart Cohen/Comstock, Inc. \n Watch a subway tunnel being dug for the Munich underground rail system, 2009 film. \n Contunico © ZDF Enterprises GmbH, Mainz \n The first subway system was proposed for London by Charles Pearson, a city solicitor, as part of a city-improvement plan shortly after the opening of the Thames Tunnel in 1843. After 10 years of discussion, Parliament authorized the construction of 3.75 miles (6 km) of underground railway between Farringdon Street and Bishop’s Road, Paddington. Work on the Metropolitan Railway began in 1860 by cut-and-cover methods —that is, by making trenches along the streets, giving them brick sides, providing girders or a brick arch for the roof, and then restoring the roadway on top. On Jan. 10, 1863, the line was opened using steam locomotives that burned coke and, later, coal; despite sulfurous fumes, the line was a success from its opening, carrying 9,500,000 passengers in the first year of its existence. In 1866 the City of London and Southwark Subway Company (later the City and South London Railway) began work on their “tube” line, using a tunneling shield developed by J.H. Greathead. The tunnels were driven at a depth sufficient to avoid interference with building foundations or public-utility works, and there was no disruption of street traffic. The original plan called for cable operation, but electric traction was substituted before the line was opened. Operation began on this first electric underground railway in 1890 with a uniform fare of twopence for any journey on the 3-mile (5-kilometre) line. In 1900 Charles Tyson Yerkes , an American railway magnate, arrived in London, and he was subsequently responsible for the construction of more tube railways and for the electrification of the cut-and-cover lines. During World Wars I and II the tube stations performed the unplanned function of air-raid shelters. \n Similar Topics \n bus \n Many other cities followed London’s lead. In Budapest , a 2.5-mile (4-kilometre) electric subway was opened in 1896, using single cars with trolley poles; it was the first subway on the European continent. Considerable savings were achieved in its construction over earlier cut-and-cover methods by using a flat roof with steel beams instead of a brick arch, and therefore, a shallower trench. \n In Paris , the Métro (Chemin de Fer Métropolitain de Paris) was started in 1898, and the first 6.25 miles (10 km) were opened in 1900. The rapid progress was attributed to the wide streets overhead and the modification of the cut-and-cover method devised by the French engineer Fulgence Bienvenue. Vertical shafts were sunk at intervals along the route; and, from there, side trenches were dug and masonry foundations to support wooden shuttering were placed immediately under the road surfaces. Construction of the roof arch then proceeded with relatively little disturbance to street traffic. This method, while it is still used in Paris, has not been widely copied in subway construction elsewhere. \n In the United States the first practical subway line was constructed in Boston between 1895 and 1897. It was 1.5 miles (2.4 km) long and at first used trolley streetcars, or tramcars. Later, Boston acquired conventional subway trains.

We are all sinners. It's just part of our human nature. It \n is part of God's divine nature to forgive, so when we forgive others, we are \n displaying a God-like quality. But because we are human we all err. \n Actually, the correct pronunciation of the word \"err\" rhymes with \"sir.\" So, \n we should say, \"to urr is human; to forgive divine.\" But if I happen to \n mispronounce it in this message, will you please act divinely and forgive \n me?\" \n We all experience relationship problems in which we are hurt or offended, so \n we'd better learn how to forgive.

Drusilla locates Diana and I-Ching, who then follow her, and brings them both across dimensional barriers to the land where Paradise Island now exists. \n Return to Paradise Island \n The land is ravaged by war, and Queen Hippolyte lies comatose and tormented. An Amazon reveals that Ares, his sister Eris, and his sons Diemos and Phobus came to Hippolyte and demanded the secret of dimensional travel so that they could travel to Earth and plunge it into bloody war. Hippolyte refused, and battle ensued, in which the Amazons were defeated. But Hippolyte still withheld the secret, whereupon Eris cursed her with a nightmare sleep that would only end when her secret was wrested from her. \n Now Mars appears to Diana and tells her that she can end her mother’s suffering by asking her to reveal the secret. But Hippolyte, even in sleep, grasps Diana’s hand, signifying her answer is still “No”. When Mars and his family attempt to kidnap Hippolyte, the Amazons surround their queen and prevent it. Mars withdraws, promising to return with troops. Diana rallies the Amazons to fight at her side against their foe, which outnumbers them five to one. Diana later dons battle armor and leads the Amazon army against Deimos’s and Phobus’s Beast Men, during which battle the enemy snatches Hippolyta.

{"question": "What word for unthinking patriotism is derived from the name of one of Napoleon's admirers?", "answers": ["chauvinism"], "context": "PatriotismPatriotism is an emotional attachment to a nation which an individual recognizes as their homeland. This attachment, also known as national feeling or national pride, can be viewed in terms of different features relating to one's own nation, including ethnic, cultural, political or historical aspects. It encompasses a set of concepts closely related to those of nationalism.    An excess of patriotism in the defense of a nation is called chauvinism; another related term is jingoism. \n The English term patriot is first attested in the Elizabethan era, via Middle French from Late Latin (6th century) patriota, meaning \"countryman\", ultimately , .  The abstract noun patriotism appears in the early 18th century.  \n History \n The general notion of civic virtue and group dedication has been attested in culture globally throughout the historical period. For the Enlightenment thinkers of 18th-century Europe, loyalty to the state was chiefly considered in contrast to loyalty to the Church. It was argued that clerics should not be allowed to teach in public schools since their patrie was heaven, so that they could not inspire love of the homeland in their students. One of the most influential proponents of this classical notion of patriotism was Jean-Jacques Rousseau. \n Enlightenment thinkers also criticized what they saw as the excess of patriotism. In 1774, Samuel Johnson published The Patriot, a critique of what he viewed as false patriotism. On the evening of 7 April 1775, he made the famous statement, \"Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.\"  James Boswell, who reported this comment in his Life of Johnson, does not provide context for the quote, and it has therefore been argued that Johnson was in fact attacking the false use of the term \"patriotism\" by contemporaries such as John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute (the patriot-minister) and his supporters; Johnson spoke elsewhere in favor of what he considered \"true\" patriotism.  However, there is no direct evidence to contradict the widely held belief that Johnson's famous remark was a criticism of patriotism itself. \n Patriotism is the will of the members of a country to support the country and help it continue. \n Philosophical issues \n Patriotism may be strengthened by adherence to a national religion (a civil religion or even a theocracy). This is the opposite of the separation of church and state demanded by the Enlightenment thinkers who saw patriotism and faith as similar and opposed forces. Michael Billig and Jean Bethke Elshtain have both argued that the difference between patriotism and faith is difficult to discern and relies largely on the attitude of the one doing the labelling.  \n Christopher Heath Wellman,  professor of philosophy at Washington University in St. Louis, describes that a popular view of the \"patriotist\" position is robust obligations to compatriots and only minimal samaritan responsibilities to foreigners.  Wellman calls this position \"patriotist\" rather than \"nationalist\" to single out the members of territorial, political units rather than cultural groups. \n Marxism \n Marxists have taken various stances regarding patriotism. On one hand, Karl Marx famously stated that \"The working men have no country\"  and that \"the supremacy of the proletariat will cause them [national differences] to vanish still faster.\" The same view is promoted by present-day Trotskyists such as Alan Woods, who is \"in favour of tearing down all frontiers and creating a socialist world commonwealth.\"  \n On the other hand, Stalinists and Maoists are usually in favour of socialist patriotism based on the theory of socialism in one country.  \n Region-specific issues \n In the European Union, thinkers such as Jürgen Habermas have advocated a \"Euro-patriotism\", but patriotism in Europe is usually directed at the nation-state and more often than not coincides with \"Euroscepticism\". \n Surveys \n Several surveys have tried to measure patriotism for various reasons, such as the Correlates of War project which found some correlation between war propensity and patriotism. The results from different studies are time dependent. For example, patriotism in Germany before World War I ranked at or near the top, whereas today it ranks at or near the bottom of patriotism surveys.", "parametric_answer": "jingoism", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

In 1990, it separated into three political parties: \n * the Green Party of England and Wales \n * the Scottish Green Party \n * the Green Party in Northern Ireland \n Despite the UK Green Party no longer existing as an entity, \"Green Party\" (singular) is still used in most media to refer collectively to all of the Green Party of England and Wales, the Scottish Green Party and the Green Party in Northern Ireland, for example in reporting opinion polls and election results. \n People, 1973–1975 \n An interview with overpopulation expert Paul R. Ehrlich in Playboy magazine inspired a small group of professional & business people to form the 'Club of Thirteen', so named because it first met on 13 October 1972 in Daventry. This included surveyors and property agents Freda Sanders and Michael Benfield, Jitendrakumar Patel (1950-2016) and husband and wife solicitors Lesley and Tony Whittaker (a former Kenilworth councillor for the Conservative Party), all with practices in Coventry. Many in this 'club' were wary of forming a political party so, after a few weeks, in November 1972 these four agreed to form 'PEOPLE' as a new political party to challenge the UK political establishment.  Its policy concerns published in 1973 included economics, employment, defence, energy (fuel) supplies, land tenure, pollution and social security, as then seen within an ecological perspective. Subsequently recognised as perhaps the world's earliest Green party this had the first edition of the Manifesto for a Sustainable Society as a background statement of policies inspired by A Blueprint for Survival (published by The Ecologist magazine). The editor of The Ecologist, Edward 'Teddy' Goldsmith, merged his 'Movement for Survival' with PEOPLE. Goldsmith became one of the leading members of the new party during the 1970s.Wall, Derek, Weaving a Bower Against Endless Night: An Illustrated History of the Green Party, 1994 \n With \"Steady State\" economics featured in the party's philosophical basis,the all-UK party became a persistent and growing presence in general elections and European elections, fielding often enough candidates to qualify for television and radio election broadcasts. \n Derek Wall, in his history of the Green Party, contends that the new political movement focused initially on the theme of survival, which shaped the \"bleak evolution\" of the nascent ecological party during the 1970s. Furthermore, the effect of the \"revolution of values\" during the 1960s would come later. In Wall's eyes, the party suffered from a lack of media attention and \"opposition from many environmentalists\", which contrasted the experience of other emerging Green parties, like Germany's Die Grünen. Nonetheless, PEOPLE invested much of its resources in engaging with the indifferent environmental movement, which Wall calls a \"tactical mistake\". \n In 1973 policy concerns included economics, employment, defence, energy (fuel) supplies, land tenure, pollution and social security, as then seen within an ecological perspective.  \"Zero growth\" (or \"steady state\") economics were a strong feature in the party's philosophical basis. \n Membership rose and the party contested both 1974 General Elections. In the February 1974 General Election, PEOPLE received 4,576 votes in 7 seats. Following the election, an influx of left-wing activists took PEOPLE in a more left-wing direction, causing something of a split. This affected preparations for the October 1974 General Election, where PEOPLE's average vote fell to just 0.7%.  After much internal debate the party's 1975 Conference adopted a proposal to change its name to 'The Ecology Party' in order to gain more recognition as the party of environmental concern. \n Party co-founder Tony Whittaker noted in an interview with Derek Wall '… voters did not connect PEOPLE with ecology.

During infertility testing, FSH is tested to determine a woman’s ovarian function and evaluate the quality of her eggs. The test is done on day 2 to 5 of the menstrual cycle. As a woman’s ovary function declines, the brain and pituitary gland increase the amount of FSH to stimulate the ovary to work “harder.” Thus the FSH test is a very indirect indicator of the ovarian status. However, in a few years this test may be replaced by the AMH test and antral follicle count. \n Determining the blood concentrations of FSH on day 3 of the menstrual cycle may estimate fertility potential. In general, women with elevated levels of FSH on cycle day 3 have reduced chances of live birth with both ovulation induction and in vitro fertilization (IVF) compared to other women of the same age. \n Estradiol (see below) must be measured as well, as elevations of estradiol can be an early warning of low ovarian reserve. High estradiol will suppress the FSH, giving false reassurance of normal values. \n The laboratory method of measuring these hormone levels may vary considerably, so it can be difficult to compare blood levels that are measured at different laboratories or by different techniques. In addition, it is important that normal and abnormal test values be based on the pregnancy rates achieved by women studied at a particular center using the same laboratory methods. \n Estradiol \n Estradiol, an important form of estrogen, is tested in conjunction with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to measure a woman’s ovarian function and to evaluate the quality of the eggs. Like FSH, it is done during days 3 to 5 of a woman’s menstrual cycle.The results of these tests are not absolute indicators of infertility but abnormal levels correlate with decreased response to ovulation induction medications and lowered IVF success. \n Luteinizing hormone \n Luteinizing Hormone (LH) stimulates the release of eggs from the ovaries and starts the production of progesterone, a hormone that transforms the uterine environment to receive a fertilized egg. LH shows up in the urine just prior to ovulation. To help women predict ovulation before it occurs, an over-the-counter test measures increases of LH in the urine. \n Progesterone \n Just after ovulation, the ovaries produce the progesterone hormone. At about 12 to 16 days into the menstrual month, progesterone prepares the uterus for the arrival of a fertilized egg. \n Progesterone levels generally peak about a week after ovulation. A physician may perform blood tests to measure the progesterone directly in the blood stream. After establishing a baseline of progesterone in the blood, a doctor will test it sometime around day 20 of the menstrual cycle. This is called a mid-luteal serum progesterone test. \n patients label  Hormones and Your Menstrual Cycle - VerywellHormones and Your Menstrual Cycle \n By Dawn Stacey, PhD, LMHC - Reviewed by a board-certified physician. \n Updated June 15, 2016 \n Question: How Do Hormones Control Your Menstrual Cycle? \n Your menstrual cycle is controlled by hormone signals in the brain.

Snowdon \n [while President of the Animal Behavior Society] \n Animal behavior is the bridge between the molecular and physiological aspects of biology and the ecological. Behavior is the link between organisms and environment and between the nervous system, and the ecosystem. Behavior is one of the most important properties of animal life. Behavior plays a critical role in biological adaptations. Behavior is how we humans define our own lives. Behavior is that part of an organism by which it interacts with its environment. Behavior is as much a part of an organisms as its coat, wings etc. The beauty of an animal includes its behavioral attributes. \n For the same reasons that we study the universe and subatomic particles there is intrinsic interest in the study of animals. In view of the amount of time that television devotes to animal films and the amount of money that people spend on nature books there is much more public interest in animal behavior than in neutrons and neurons. If human curiosity drives research, then animal behavior should be near the top of our priorities. \n Research on animal behavior and behavioral ecology has been burgeoning in recent years despite below inflation increases (and often decreases) in research funding. Two of our journals Animal Behaviour and Behavior Ecology and Sociobiology rank in the top six behavioral science AND zoological journals in terms of impact as measured by the Science Citation Index. From 1985 to 1990 Animal Behaviour has grown from quarterly to monthly publication and its page budget has more than doubled. Many related journals have increased their size and frequency of publication in the same period. Ours is an active and vital field. \n While the study of animal behavior is important as a scientific field on its own, our science has made important contributions to other disciplines with applications to the study of human behavior, to the neurosciences, to the environment and resource management, to the study of animal welfare and to the education of future generations of scientists. \n A.  ANIMAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN SOCIETY \n Many problems in human society are often related to the interaction of environment and behavior or genetics and behavior. The fields of socioecology and animal behavior deal with the issue of environment behavioral interactions both at an evolutionary level and a proximate level. Increasingly social scientists are turning to animal behavior as a framework in which to interpret human society and to understand possible causes of societal problems. (e.g. Daly and Wilson's book on human homicide is based on an evolutionary analysis from animal research. Many studies on child abuse utilize theory and data from studies on infanticide in animals.) \n Research by de Waal on chimpanzees and monkeys has illustrated the importance of cooperation and reconciliation in social groups. This work provides new perspectives by which to view and ameliorate aggressive behavior among human beings. \n The methodology applied to study animal behavior has had a tremendous impact in psychology and the social sciences. Jean Piaget began his career with the study of snails, and he extended the use of careful behavioral observations and descriptions to his landmark studies on human cognitive development. J. B. Watson began his study of behavior by observing gulls. Aspects of experimental design, observation techniques, attention to nonverbal communication signals were often developed in animal behavior studies before their application to studies of human behavior. The behavioral study of humans would be much diminished today without the influence of animal research. \n Charles Darwin's work on emotional expression in animals has had an important influence on many psychologists, such as Paul Ekman, who study human emotional behavior. \n Harry Harlow's work on social development in rhesus monkeys has been of major importance to theories of child development and to psychiatry. The work of Overmier, Maier and Seligman on learned helplessness has had a similar effect on child development and psychiatry. \n The comparative study of behavior over a wide range of species can provide insights into influences affecting human behavior. For example, the woolly spider monkey in Brazil displays no overt aggressive behavior among group members. We might learn how to minimize human aggression if we understood how this species of monkey avoids aggression.

One gas is much more abundant than any other. Can you guess which one it is? \n Answer: By far, the most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere is nitrogen , which accounts for about 78% of the mass of dry air. Oxygen is the next most abundant gas, present at levels of 20-21%. Although humid air seems like it contains a lot of water, the maximum amount of water vapor that air can hold is only about 4%. \n Abundance of Gases in the Atmosphere \n This table lists the eleven most abundant gases in the lower portion of Earth's atmosphere (up to 25 km). While the percentage of nitrogen and oxygen are fairly stable, the amount of greenhouse gases changes and depends on location. Water vapor is extremely variable. In arid or extremely cold regions, water vapor may be nearly absent. In warm, tropical regions, water vapor accounts for a significant portion of atmospheric gases. \n continue reading below our video \n Test Your General Science Knowledge \n Some references include other gases on this list, such as krypton (less abundant than helium, but more than hydrogen), xenon (less abundant than hydrogen), nitrogen dioxide (less abundant than ozone), and iodine (less abundant than ozone). \n Gas \n * gases with variable composition \n Reference: Pidwirny, M. (2006). \"Atmospheric Composition\". Fundamentals of Physical Geography, 2nd Edition. \n The average concentration of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxde, methane, and nitrous dioxide has been increasing. Ozone is concentrated around cities and in the Earth's stratosphere. In addition to the elements in the table and krypton, xenon, nitrogen dioxide, and iodine (all mentioned earlier), there are trace amounts of ammonia, carbon monoxide, and several other gases. \n Why Is Important To Know the Abundance of Gases? \n It's important to know which gas is most abundant, what the other gases are in the Earth's atmosphere, and how the composition of air changes with altitude and over time for multiple reasons. The information helps us understand and predict the weather. The amount of water vapor in air is particularly relevant to weather forecasting.

It is essential to all life and serves several purposes, such as providing air for respiration, absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, protecting the earth from falling meteorites, controlling climate and regulating the water cycle. The Earth’s atmosphere is composed of approximately 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, 1 percent argon and trace amounts of other gases that include carbon dioxide and neon. \n Nitrogen \n Thinkstock/Comstock/Getty Images \n Nitrogen is a colorless, unscented and inert (does not react with other chemicals) gas. Chemist Daniel Rutherford first discovered this chemical element in 1772. Nitrogen is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere and is found in all living organisms. Nitrogen is an important component of amino acids, protein, DNA and RNA. All living organisms depend on nitrogen for growth, metabolic processes and reproduction. \n The atmosphere is the primary source of nitrogen; however, plants and animals are not able to use it directly. Nitrogen enters the soil through precipitation, animal waste and dead organic matter. Bacteria in the soil convert the nitrogen into ammonium and nitrate, which are two forms of nitrogen", "parametric_answer": "nitrogen", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

Battlefields       were often miles from medical tents. An injured soldier could die on his       to treatment         if he had to be carried by men on foot. Although we may think of       ambulances in terms of automobiles, earlier forms of ambulances were used       as long ago as the middle ages, when men wounded in battle during the       Crusades (a series of eight extended battles fought by European noblemen       from 1095-1291 to protect the Christian Byzantine empire from Muslim       Turks) were transported by horse-drawn wagons to centralized treatment       centers. \n Father of the Modern Ambulance \n The modern ambulance—at least the horse-driven version—was       cre-ated by Frenchman Dominique-Jean Larrey (1766-1842) in 1792. Larrey, Napoleon's private surgeon, wanted to       improve battlefield treatment of wounded soldiers. He designed a       horse-drawn \"flying ambulance\" to carry surgeons and medical       supplies onto the field of battle during the Rhine campaign of 1792. \n For the Italian campaign of 1794, Larrey used light ambulance carriages       with stretchers to carry the wounded. In Egypt in 1799, local camels       powered Larrey's ambulances. With fellow surgeon Pierre Percy       (1754-1825), Larrey formed a battalion of ambulance soldiers, including       stretcher bearers and surgeons. Larrey's ambulances and the swift       medical attention they brought significantly boosted the morale of       Napoleon's troops. \n Ambulance service was expanded from the military to the civilian world in       1869 by Bellevue Hospital in New York City. The Larrey \"flying       ambulance\" remained standard until the first motorized ambulances       appeared around the turn of the century. These motorized vehicles were       pioneered by the Panhard-Levassor partnership of France. \n A modern ambulance speeds off in response to an emergency call. \n Air and Ground Ambulances \n The first airborne ambulances were hot-air balloons used to evacuate       wounded personnel from Paris during a Prussian siege in 1870. Heli-copters       began to transport wounded soldiers during World War II (1939-1945) and       became vital evacuation vehicles in the Korean (1950-1953) and Vietnam       (1965-1973) wars. Today, air ambulances—both fixed-wing and       helicopters—are increasingly used for quick transportation of       patients, particularly in busy cities, but also in rural areas where       medical care may be a great distance from the scene of an accident. \n Until the mid-1960s, ambulances were mostly modified hearses, since these       vehicles could transport patients in a supine (lying down on one's       back) position. Since hearses were designed to carry corpses instead of       living patients needing care, they had little room for supplies or       attendants, let alone treatment en route to the hospital. A National       Academy of Science/National Research Council report in 1966 focused       attention on the need for both professional training of emergency medical       technicians (EMTs) and improvements in ambulance design. This report       resulted in today's modern van ambulance, with it's working       space and sophisticated supplies and equipment. The van ambulance is       operated by medical para-professionals, so that the ambulance is no longer       simply a transportation vehicle—it is also a moving treatment       center. \n User Contributions: \n Comment about this article, ask questions, or add new information about this topic: \n Name:  History of Ambulances - EMT ResourcesHistory of Ambulances \n The History of Ambulances \n Overview of the History of Ambulances \n The term ambulance comes from the Latin word ambulare which means to walk or move about which is a reference to early medical care where patients were moved by lifting or wheeling.

In the original series Bob appears as a building contractor specializing in masonry in a stop motion animated programme with his colleague Wendy, various neighbours and friends, and their gang of anthropomorphised work-vehicles and equipment, all made of clay. The show is broadcast in many countries, but originates from the United Kingdom where Bob is voiced by English actor Neil Morrissey. The show was later created using CGI animation starting with the spin-off series Ready, Steady, Build!. \n In each episode, Bob and his group help with renovations, construction, and repairs and with other projects as needed. The show emphasizes conflict resolution, co-operation, socialization and various learning skills. Bob's catchphrase is Can we fix it?, to which the other characters respond with Yes we can! This phrase is also the title of the show's theme song, which was a million-selling number one hit in the UK. \n In October 2014, Bob the Builder was revamped by Mattel for a new series to be aired on Channel 5's Milkshake! in 2015. Amongst the changes were a complete overhaul of the cast, with Harry Potter actor Lee Ingleby replacing Neil Morrissey as the voice of Bob, and Joanne Froggatt and Blake Harrison were also confirmed as the voices of Wendy and Scoop respectively.

It has never been proclaimed the national anthem by an Act of Parliament or a Royal Proclamation. \n Lyrics \n God save our gracious Queen \n Long live our noble Queen, \n God save the Queen:  A complete guide to God Save The Queen – Royal CentralA complete guide to God Save The Queen – Royal Central \n Getting to know Timothy Laurence \n As a royalist, I feel having a national anthem about our Queen is a fantastic thing. Republicans argue (they always do) that God Save The Queen shouldn’t be Britain’s anthem because it’s ‘all about The Queen’ – we’ll come onto why that’s not the case in just a minute, though I thought I’d take this opportunity to go back a few centuries to see how the song (and then anthem) came into existence. \n In 1745, the patriotic song God Save The King was performed in London for the first time. The lyrics, rather different to what we know as God Save The Queen these days, but the tune – unmistakably that of the anthem. \n The song was actually written as a rallying cry around the King after the defeat of his army at Prestopans by that of the ‘Young Pretender’ – Charles Edward Stuart, now more commonly known as Bonnie Prince Charlie. \n Starting in a theatre in London, before spreading to others across the country, the practice of playing God Save The King at the end of performances became de rigueur and eventually the tune was adopted as the official national anthem of Great Britain. \n To this day the tune remains the anthem of the United Kingdom and also of some of the other realms with Her Majesty as Head of State. \n The tune to God Save The King even forms the basis to some other countries’ national songs including America’s My Country is of Thee, The Norwegian Royal Anthem and even the national anthem of Liechtenstein! \n The anthem has moved with the times and in 1952, (as in 1837) was modified from God Save The King to God Save The Queen, on Her Majesty’s accession to the throne – ever since she has doubtless heard it thousands of times, yet the only one she was apparently genuinely moved by was Benjamin Britten’s rendition of the anthem, first played in the 1960s and played annually at Last Night of the Proms (below). \n Nowadays, despite no official record of the anthem’s current verses existing, through tradition and persistence of use, 6 verses have been ‘adopted’ as the de facto official anthem (see below). \n Typically, only the first verse is sung though on occasion a second verse may be sung (when two verses are sung, it’s verses 1 and 3) and on rare occasions, all of the first three verses may be used. Almost never are any of the other 3 verses used. \n In fact, most Britons know the first verse and part of the second verse, though as a general rule that’s enough to get by on most occasions – the anthem is quite slow in comparison to other nations’ anthems, so typically just the first verse is used because of this. \n Two verses are used in the presence of Her Majesty usually. \n Verse 6 holds a special place with the national anthem in that it can never be used.

Originally broadcast in the old Tube timeslot of 6 pm Friday evenings, The Word's main live show was shifted to a late-night timeslot, with a compilation sister show fronted by Mark Lamarr in the week. The magazine format allowed for interviews, live music, features and even game shows. The flexible late-night format meant that guests could do just about anything to be controversial. \n There was also an 'I'll do anything to be on television' section called \"The Hopefuls\" in which people ate worms, bathed in maggots, licked sweat off fat people, and did generally repulsive things in order to get featured on the programme. \n    How The Word changed television for ever | Television ...How The Word changed television for ever | Television & radio | The Guardian \n Television & radio \n How The Word changed television for ever \n The show's creator on how, 20 years ago, Channel 4 changed television for ever with an outrageous late-night programme that was a deliberate challenge to the establishment \n Terry Christian presenting The Word. \n Tuesday 10 August 2010 03.00 EDT \n First published on Tuesday 10 August 2010 03.00 EDT \n Share on Messenger \n Close \n The Word, one of the most notorious TV shows of all time, was born on Friday, 17 August 1990. Its first presenters – Amanda de Cadenet and Terry Christian – somehow managed to get up everyone's noses. But its mix of A-list guests, the hottest bands, filmed stories and studio stunts got people talking about it more than any other \"youth\" show before it. \n Loathed by many, especially the press, the show's defining moments arose from its choice of live music and its dozens of innovative items – Oliver Reed being secretly filmed drinking in his dressing room, Lynne Perrie doing her own special (and lubricated) version of I Will Survive after being sacked from Coronation Street, a strand called The Hopefuls in which viewers came on and did unpleasant things such as snogging an old woman, because, as they said: \"I'd do anything to get on television.\" \n In this post-Big Brother and X Factor world it is hard to imagine now how revolutionary the show was, but in 1990 multichannel TV had hardly started, the independent television production sector was tiny, and the most risque show on TV was Blind Date. People used to go to bed at 11pm, even on Fridays. It was only when Michael Grade , then chief executive of Channel 4, changed the Word's transmission time from 6pm to 11pm a few weeks after it began that the programme became essential post-pub fodder, and it changed viewing habits for ever. \n Social attitudes now reflect the outlook of the generation that watched The Word rather than the ones who complained about it. But in 1990, Britain was a different place, with Margaret Thatcher in her final days as prime minister and only the first flickerings of the optimism and prosperity that would be the abiding spirit of the late-90s and early noughties. Members of the establishment (especially politicians) invariably wore ties. The Word reflected the rift between the laidback attitude of younger people and the establishment, something that no other TV show was then doing. \n Our brief was to appeal to an audience of 16- to 34-year-olds. My goal was to get it talked about the next day – the \"watercooler moment\" as executives would describe it later. Channel 4 , then a different place, supported and encouraged the controversial.

{"question": "In a standard deck of cards, how many Kings have a moustache?", "answers": ["three"], "context": "How many kings are in a deck of cards? | Reference.comHow many kings are in a deck of cards? | Reference.com \n How many kings are in a deck of cards? \n A: \n Quick Answer \n There are four kings in a standard deck of playing cards. One king belongs to each of the four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades. \n Full Answer \n The king is the highest ranking of the three face card types. After the king comes the queen and then the jack. In most games, the ace is the highest ranking card and the only card ranked above a king. A standard deck of cards contains 52 total cards that are divided evenly among the four suits. In addition to the face cards and the aces, there are cards in each suit for the numbers two through ten.  Playing cardA playing card is a piece of specially prepared heavy paper, thin cardboard, plastic-coated paper, cotton-paper blend, or thin plastic, marked with distinguishing motifs and used as one of a set for playing card games. Playing cards are typically palm-sized for convenient handling. \n A complete set of cards is called a pack (UK English), deck (US English), or set (Universal), and the subset of cards held at one time by a player during a game is commonly called a hand. A pack of cards may be used for playing a variety of card games, with varying elements of skill and chance, some of which are played for money (e.g., poker and blackjack games at a casino). Playing cards are also used for illusions, cardistry, building card structures, cartomancy and memory sport. \n The front (or \"face\") of each card carries markings that distinguish it from the other cards in the pack and determine its use under the rules of the game being played. The back of each card is identical for all cards in any particular pack to create an imperfect information scenario. Usually every card will be smooth; however, some packs have braille to allow blind people to read the card number and suit. \n Dedicated deck card games have sets that are used only for a specific game. The cards described in this article are used for many games and share a common origin stemming from the standards set in Mamluk Egypt. These sets divide their cards into four suits each consisting of three face cards and numbered or \"pip\" cards. \n History \n Early history \n The scholarly consensus is that playing cards were invented in Imperial China.  They first appeared as early as 9th century Tang China (618–907).    The first reference to card games also dates from the 9th century, when the Collection of Miscellanea at Duyang, written by Tang dynasty writer Su E, described Princess Tongchang, daughter of Emperor Yizong of Tang, playing the \"leaf game\" in 868 with members of the Wei clan, the family of the princess' husband.   The first known book on the \"leaf\" game was called the Yezi Gexi and was allegedly written by a Tang woman, and was commented on by Chinese writers of subsequent dynasties. The Song dynasty (960–1279) scholar Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) asserted that the \"leaf\" game existed at least since the mid-Tang dynasty and associated their invention with the simultaneous development of using sheets or pages instead of paper rolls as a writing medium.   However, Ouyang claimed the \"leaves\" were pages of a book for a board game played with dice.  In any case, Ouyang asserted that the rules for the game were lost by 1067. \n It may be that the first pack of cards ever printed was a 32-card Chinese domino pack, in whose cards all 21 combinations of a pair of dice are depicted. According to the Gui Tian Lu (歸田錄), an 11th-century Chinese text redacted, domino cards were printed during the Tang dynasty, contemporary to the first printed books. There is difficulty distinguishing paper cards and gaming tiles in many early sources as the Chinese word pái (牌) is used to describe both.

They embarked upon what was to become a lengthy relationship. In 1994, she accompanied Grant to the premiere of his Four Weddings and a Funeral film, wearing a striking Versace dress that was held together down each side with outsized gold safety pins. It was this appearance that brought her to the attention of Estée Lauder. \n Her first modelling job, for Estée Lauder, was at the age of 29. She has gone on to feature in many of their advertising campaigns. Although she was replaced as the face of the company in 2001, she has continued to model for them in a lesser role and in 2008 her contract was renewed for the 14th year. \n Liz Hurley has also featured in ad campaigns for Monsoon, Lancel and Patrick Cox as well as having three Vogue cover shots to her name. She launched her own swimwear range, Elizabeth Hurley Beach in 2005 and in 2008, launched a range of 12 swimsuits for MANGO, the Spanish clothing label. \n Film Career: Hurley's first film appearance was in Aria in 1987. She went on to appear in a number of low-budget films but most notably, she appeared alongside Mike Myers in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery and Austin Powers: the Spy Who Shagged Me. Hurley's performances have never garnered much acclaim from critics and in 2000, she was nicknamed 'Elizabeth Scabley', for breaking a five month acting strike, to film an Estée Lauder advert. She was fined £70,000 by the Screen Actors' Guild. \n Hurley is credited as an executive producer on two of the films released by Hugh Grant's own production company. Grant starred in both of the films, Mickey Blue Eyes and Extreme Measures. The company closed its US offices in 2002 and Grant legally resigned as director in 2005. \n Television Work: Liz Hurley was broadly criticised for her work on the Sky One reality show Project Catwalk. Not only did her presenting style come under scrutiny, but she was also criticised for asking contestants to send her free clothes, off the record. She was dropped after the first series of the show, after it achieved only 1% of its target audience. \n Personal Life: Hurley dated Hugh Grant between 1987 and 2000. In 1995, Hurley stood by Grant when he was arrested with a prostitute in Los Angeles. Five years later, they announced an 'amicable split'. \n In April 2002, Hurley gave birth to Damian Charles, the son of the film producer Stephen Bing. Bing denied paternity until a DNA test proved that he is, indeed, Damian's father. Elizabeth Hurley is also godmother to Patsy Kensit's son Lennon. \n In 2007, Liz Hurley married the Indian textile heir Arun Nayar. They were first married at Sudeley Castle, followed by a second, Hindu ceremony in Jodhpur, India. The celebrations were reported to have cost around £2 million, but the couple were paid that amount by Hello! Magazine for the sale of the wedding photographs. Guests at the wedding included Elton John, Elle Macpherson, Patsy Kensit, Donatella Versace, Valentino and Tracey Emin. \n Biography by Contactmusic.com \n Patrick Cox and Elizabeth Hurley at a special performance of Letters Live hosted by Porter Magazine in celebration of their Incredible Women of 2016 edition held at The V&A - London, United Kingdom - Tuesday 29th", "parametric_answer": "shane warne", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

{"question": "What sport or pastime would you be playing if your balls were black and blue and your opponent's were red and yellow?", "answers": ["croquet", "croquet mallet"], "context": "Croquet World Online Magazine | Letters & OpinionCroquet World Online Magazine | Letters & Opinion \n \"After the Revolution,\" New Zealand Report, Steve Jones, 1998 \n We've had the debate, ad infinitem; now let's confront the facts, examine the  fears behind the talk, and consider the practical possibilities. \n The scantily clad apparition with the croquet mallet strides through the gate  and approaches the lawn, Jesus slippers flip-flopping with each step against  the bare soles of his feet.  He pauses at court's edge, puts down his ragged  backpack and extracts from it a vial of sun lotion, which he proceeds to  apply to every square inch of exposed flesh, and there's a lot of it.  He  wears below only a bikini thong, while on top a tie-dyed tank top mercifully  conceals from view a considerable gut overhanging pale, hairy legs. \n Oblivious to the disapproving frowns of other club members courtside, he  wipes his oily paws on the tank top and takes from the backpack a big cigar,  lights it, and puffs greedily as he raises his gaze to survey the court,  teeth exposed in a half-smile of satisfaction.  Spying a set of balls nearby,  he sets himself a three-ball break and begins knocking the balls around the  court, enjoying the feel of the warm sun on his freshly oiled skin, happily  puffing smoke with each good hit, prepared to enjoy a couple of hours  indulging his full rights as a member in good standing. \n This apparition is the worst fear of the all-white croquet fashion nazis who  vehemently resist all change.  Is it a reasonable fear? \n Whites down under, 1951: The South Australia test team exudes confidence in their cool white culottes and sporty hats. Reprinted by permission of CROQUET AUSTRALIA. \n The history of this debate over the last decade suggests that it is not. Lawn bowlers began to  relax their all-white clothing standard many years ago, but if you visit a  lawn bowling facility anywhere in the world, you are likely to see everyone  in white.  Croquet New Zealand changed its regulation last year to a very loose injunction suggesting \"appropriate\" clothing, but those few who shun whites are still the exception  that proves the continued dominance of all-whites.  Local clubs here and  there - for all manner of reasons - have eased their costume restrictions,  but evidence of significant change in the croquet fashion culture is hard to  find. \n Revolutionists point to recent rulings of the Croquet Players Association of  New South Wales which, according to Peter Tavender, president of the CPA [the  official state organization], were widely misinterpreted. \"The Council  meeting,\" he says, \"rejected two motions...to do away with wearing whites for  CPA events and a similar motion for the ACA events.  The only motion that was  passed was that the CPA encourage clubs to 'amend their regulations to remove  the compulsory wearing of whites'.\" \n The real movement is towards more freedom of choice \n Whites with an attitude, 1985:  If the models in this San Francisco fashion shoot had stuck around to play the game, croquet might have changed its image without adopting colours. \n The CPA of New South Wales was not decreeing a new clothing standard, but  only allowing local clubs freedom of choice in the matter - the same kind of  freedom of choice that also now applies in South Australia, according to  Wendy Davidson, editor of CROQUET AUSTRALIA: \"The latest (1999) in South Australia is that you wear a club uniform or predominately white when playing in SACA events, and each club can decide what is worn at their club at any time.  Most clubs, in fact all clubs I know of in South Australia, have coloured winter gear.

This Ferguside royal clan had rivalled the crown (of Dalriada, then that of Alba) against the Cenél Loairn, the later House of Moray for the preceding four or more centuries. The Cenél nGabráin were represented by the so-called House of Alpin before Dunkeld. \n Sir Iain Moncreiffe made the case that Crínán of Dunkeld actually belonged to a Scottish sept of Irish Cenél Conaill royal dynasty.[1] This of course would not exclude his descendants from also being a (female line) continuation of the Cenél nGabráin through Bethóc. \n Genealogically the Dunkeld dynasty is based on Duncan I of Scotland being of a different agnatic clan to his predecessor and maternal grandfather Malcolm II of Scotland. However, sociohistorically, the reign of Duncan's son Malcolm III of Scotland, which happens to coincide with the start of the centuries-long period of strong influence from the southern neighbour, the Kingdom of England, has been seen as a more important place to start. \n Domnall III, r. 1093-1094 and 1094-1097 \n Donnchad II, r. 1094 \n William I (William the Lion), r.1165-1214 \n Alexander II, r.1214-1249  House of StuartThe House of Stuart, originally Stewart and, in Gaelic, Stiubhard is a European royal house that originated in Scotland. The dynasty's patrilineal Breton ancestors had held the office of High Steward of Scotland since the 12th century, after arriving by way of Norman England. The royal Stewart line was founded by Robert II, and they were Kings and Queens of Scots from the late 14th century through the union with England in 1707.  Mary I, Queen of Scots was brought up in France, where she adopted the French spelling of the name, Stuart.  Her son, James VI of Scotland, inherited the thrones of England and Ireland upon the death of Elizabeth I in 1603.  Except for the period of the Commonwealth, 1649-1660, the Stuarts were monarchs of England, Scotland and Ireland until 1707; then of Great Britain and Ireland, to the death of Queen Anne in 1714. \n In total, nine Stewart/Stuart monarchs ruled Scotland alone from 1371 until 1603. James VI of Scotland then inherited the realms of Elizabeth I of England, becoming James I of England and Ireland in the Union of the Crowns. Following the Glorious Revolution in 1688, two Stuart queens ruled the isles: Mary II and Anne. Both were the Protestant daughters of James VII and II by his first wife.  Their father had converted to Catholicism and his new wife gave birth to a son in 1688, who would brought up a Roman Catholic and would precede his half-sisters; so James was deposed by Parliament in 1689, in favour of his daughters.  But neither had any children who survived to adulthood, so under the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Act of Security 1704, the crown passed to the House of Hanover on the death of Queen Anne in 1714. \n During the reign of the Stuarts, Scotland developed from a relatively poor and feudal country into a prosperous, modern and centralised state. They ruled during a time in European history of transition from the Middle Ages, through the Renaissance, to the midpoint of the Early modern period. Monarchs such as James IV were known for sponsoring exponents of the Northern Renaissance such as the poet Robert Henryson, and others.

Last year Sheridan Smith portrayed Mrs Ronnie Biggs for ITV, but what took them so long to get around to the Great Train Robbery itself? Just hours too long for the real Ronnie Biggs, as it happened. \n Scripted by Chris Chibnall, a man basking in bankability following his bustin' hit series Broadchurch for ITV, this two-part voyage round the GTR is stylish, well cast and easy to watch, but adds nothing much to the existing information-mountain about the crime. You'd get more bang for your buck by digging out the 1967 movie Robbery, a thinly disguised version of the GTR story directed by Peter Bullitt Yates, while the depiction of the robbery itself doesn't differ greatly from the way they did it in Buster, the 1988 movie starring Phil Collins as train-robber Buster Edwards (nemesis awaits, pictured below). \n This retelling has a bit of fun with cool Avengers-style mood music and Sixties-evoking split-screen graphics, though this leaves you wondering just how seriously you're supposed take it. In addition, Chibnall has introduced a slightly grating overlay of retrospective political awareness, with robbery mastermind Bruce Reynolds seemingly possessing a clairvoyant gift for anticipating the kind of sociological post-rationalisation later patented by John McVicar. In his more ponderous moments, Bruce isn't a mere career criminal but a man on a class war crusade, raising the consciousness of the light-fingered community. \n Robbing the Royal Mail train en route from Glasgow to Euston isn't just a heist, it's \"one in the eye for all the old duffers running this country.\" When the police raise a mighty hue and cry in the aftermath of the robbery, and he hears that Tommy Butler has set up a special Flying Squad task force to hunt the raiders, Bruce declares that \"we kicked the Establishment up the arse, mate. The Establishment didn't like it\" (the Establishment didn't, of course, and the police and judiciary later had to admit that the original heavy sentences handed down to the robbers were excessive.) \n But Bruce's street-fighting-man bravado doesn't quite square with his dismay when he discovers that instead of the million quid they anticipated stealing, they've netted a colossal £2.6m. \"It wasn't supposed to be the crime of the bleedin' century!\" he protests, as though the Flying Squad would have sent them on their way with a jocular clip round the ear if they'd only stolen a modest £1m. \n Nonetheless, Luke Evans's portrayal of Reynolds is strong enough to make him the natural centre of gravity of the gang. He keeps the thuggish inclinations of some of his underlings in check with his gift for meticulous planning and clarity of thought, and it's not entirely his fault if the rug is pulled out from under them when the weak links in the chain fail to accomplish their assigned tasks (like burning down the gang's rural hideout, which was disastrously left intact with telltale fingerprints for the constabulary to find).  \n There's flavoursome support from Neil Maskell as Buster Edwards, Martin Compston as getaway driver Roy James and Jack Roth as Charlie Wilson (Compston and Maskell pictured above), and the thespometer will be cranked into the red in tonight's part two when", "parametric_answer": "butch cassidy", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}
{"question": "Which famous cowboy was created by George W. Trendle?", "answers": ["lone ranger"], "context": "George W. Trendle - Lone Ranger Wiki - WikiaGeorge W. Trendle | Lone Ranger Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia \n Edit \n During the 1920's, George W. Trendle was a Detroit, Michigan lawyer who had established a reputation as a tough negotiator, specializing in movie contracts and leases. \n Trendle became involved in the Detroit area entertainment business in 1928, when local motion picture theater owner John H. Kunsky offered Trendle 25 per cent ownership in exchange for his services. \n Kunsky had been an early investor in Nickelodeons beginning in 1905. In 1911, he built the first movie theater in Detroit. It was the second movie theater in the nation. By 1928, he owned twenty movie theaters, including four of the largest first-run theaters in Detroit. \n Kunsky was being driven out of the theater business, when Adolph Zukor acquired the Detroit area film exchange known as the Cooperative Booking Office and began pressuring local theater owners to sell out to Paramount. Trendle negotiated to sell Kunsky's theatres for six million dollars. Zukor transferred the theaters to a Paramount subsidiary named United Detroit Theatres. In 1948, Paramount's monopoly became the focus of an antitrust suit initiated by the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers (SIMPP). \n As part of the deal, Trendle and Kunsky were required never to reenter the movie business in Detroit. \n However, Zukor apparently recognized Trendle's talents and hired him to manage the Paramount theaters in Detroit. Trendle is credited as \"having built\" the historic Alger Theater which opened August 22, 1935 on Detroit's east side. Trendle was fired from the United Detroit Theatres for \"negligence\" in 1937. \n Radio and television stations \n Edit \n Trendle and Kunsky formed the Kunsky-Trendle Broadcasting Company in 1929, after purchasing Detroit radio station WGHP. The radio station's call letters were changed to WXYZ . \n Trendle was the President and Kunsky was the Vice President of the company. Trendle was active as the station manager. Kunsky is rarely mentioned, except as co-owner. \n WXYZ was initially affiliated with the Columbia Broadcasting System but became an independent station within a year. Trendle's partner Kunsky legally changed his name to King in 1936 and the 'Kunsky-Trendle Broadcasting Company' became the 'King-Trendle Broadcasting Company'. \n In 1931, Kunsky-Trendle acquired WASH and WOOD in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The two stations merged facilities, including studios and transmitters but retained both station licenses. WASH was on the air from 8am to Noon, and WOOD from Noon to Midnight. WOOD-WASH became an NBC Red affiliate in 1935. King and Trendle decided to drop the WASH license in 1942, keeping the WOOD identification. \n In 1946, the newly formed American Broadcasting Company purchased the King-Trendle Broadcasting Company and its radio stations for $ 3.65 million dollars. This sale was for the broadcast facilities (including WOOD, WXYZ and the Michigan Regional Network), but did not include ownership of Trendle's radio programs. The FCC approved ABC's purchase on July 18, 1946. In 1952, Paramount Theaters (owners of Kunsky and Trendle's former chain of Detroit area theaters) acquired ABC, including WXYZ. \n Trendle entered into a new partnership with long term business associates H. Allen Campbell and Raymond Meurer. The Trendle-Campbell Broadcasting Company was formed in 1946 and started radio station WTCB in Flint, Michigan. The new radio station went on the air April 26, 1946 with a four tower 1000 watt broadcast array. The call letters were later changed to WTAC. In 1953, they added UHF television station WTAC-TV affiliated with ABC TV and DuMont. The TV station went out of business less than a year later because too few TVs at the time were equipped to receive UHF channels. The radio station has changed owners several times and its call sign was changed to WSNL in 1997. The station is currently owned by The Christian Broadcasting System. \n Another Trendle-Campbell radio station (WPON) went on the air in December 1954. The station was located in Pontiac, Michigan with studios in the Waldron Hotel in downtown Pontiac.

Generalizing is a way of dealing with the vast amounts of data people continually process.  Now that many of us in the “developed” world spend much of our time indoors, those skills earned from thousands of generations of learning about the environment have transferred to media of various sorts.  I watch a lot of movies—they are my escape from an urban reality that often weighs too heavily on my primate brain.  Long ago I relegated Disney to that shelf of the least profound films.  Although many of their animated features of the past decade or so have introduced complexities and some seriousness into the mix, often I find myself still hungry after sitting through a helping of the Disney fantasy-land.  It seems to me that nature is crueler and more careless than Disney makes it out to be.  Nevertheless, sometimes something profound can be discovered in the most unlikely of places. \n I never saw Mary Poppins until I was in college, but now I come back to it as an adult from time to time and I still learn from it.  While watching recently it struck me that two worlds (at least) are juxtaposed here: the world of St. Paul’s Cathedral and the Dawes Tomes Mousley Grubbs Fidelity Fiduciary Bank.  On the night before the Banks children accompany their father to the bank, Mary Poppins suggests that some things are important, although quite small.  She refers, of course, to the birds that the Bird Lady uses to make her pitiful living.  She sells crumbs within sight of an opulent bank that stands for the order of society.  She is dressed in poor clothing, a beggar woman under the protective gaze of saint and apostles.  The bank has guards and bars and powerful men.  The worlds are brought into collision by Jane and Michael wanting to feed the birds but they instead are forced to open a bank account.  In the ensuing melee, George Banks takes the blame and is fired. \n On his way to the bank that night to be sacked, he reevaluates.  In a brief but significant scene, he pauses in front of the Cathedral, deserted at night, and scans where the Bird Lady sat.  The scene immediately cuts to the bank, still at work, its great doors snapped open by uniformed guards.  The Cathedral, dark and glowering, is just down the street.  And yet, once dismissed Mr. Banks chooses the way of the Bird Lady, an unemployed man spending tuppence for paper and string to mend a kite.  No, I don’t attribute much profundity to Disney, but Mary Poppins does give pause for a moment.  We never see the inside of the Cathedral.  It is generally dark and forbidding.  The bank is light and inviting, yet liable to turn on you.  Maybe it is merely lack of sleep, but as I closed my eyes last night, it seemed that even Disney may have, for one brief instant, turned its back on money. \n Share this:  Mr. Dawes Sr. - Disney Wiki - WikiaMr. Dawes Sr. | Disney Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia \n “ The man's gone mad.

Shipman had been taken off ‘suicide watch’ 18 months earlier while at Frankland prison, near Durham. \n His wife Primrose was due to visit him the following day – his 58th birthday – and had spoken to him the night before, when she had found him to be behaving normally. \n Nevertheless, the jury at the inquest into his death would find that he had killed himself as he was in despair at the thought of being incarcerated, and because he had established that his wife would be entitled to an NHS pension if he died before the age of 60. \n The jury found that Shipman was \"neither bullied nor goaded\" into taking his own life. A pathologist told the inquest that Shipman had not been attacked or murdered, and ruled out the possibility that the suicide was an accident. \n Shipman was jailed for life in January 2000 for murdering 15 patients, the victims dying from lethal injections he administered. The Shipman enquiry established that he almost certainly killed 200 others, and had a ‘real suspicion’ that he was responsible for 45 more. \n The former GP maintained his innocence throughout, always insisting that he had simply administered pain-relief, and had been planning an appeal against his conviction before his death. \n What did you make of Harold Shipman’s suicide? Did you live in the area where he practised? Let us know in the Comments section below. \n Harold Shipman - Did you know? \n Harold Shipman saw his mother die of lung cancer when he was 17 years old. In the late stages of her life, she was administered pain-killing morphine at home by her own doctor, in a manner that Shipman’s murders would later emulate. \n It is now believed that Shipman killed patients from his very earliest days as a GP, when working in Todmorden, West Yorkshire. He moved to Hyde, Greater Manchester, eventually becoming a sole practitioner in 1993. \n He was first investigated in early 1998 due to the large numbers of cremations of his patients he was requesting authorisation for. The investigation foundered, and Shipman murdered three more patients before he was finally arrested. \n Shipman was caught when he forged a will in the name of his final victim, Kathleen Grundy, which excluded her lawyer daughter and grandchildren but left him a sum of £386,000. \n He was tried and convicted for the murders of 15 patients between 1995 and 1998; the Shipman Inquiry, chaired by Dame Janet Smith, found that he had killed on at least 200 other occasions. \n While in prison, Shipman liked to play Scrabble, joined a card school and was writing a biography of Napoleon. He signed up to an English literature course and studied the peninsular wars. \n Primrose Shipman said she had had a \"two-minute\" conversation with her husband about suicide while he was on remand at Strangeways prison in Manchester in 1999.

I’m not talking about the electronic organiser that caused the recent Barack Obama controvery . Not that I didn’t have issues of my own when it came to putting a blackberry plant in our bramble row. When we bought our block at Icy Creek five years ago, the paddocks were two metres high with these prickly pests of plants, and we’re still fighting to keep them at bay. But the Thornless Blackberry plant I bought at a nursery will not, I’m assured, take hold of the region. And if only grows as half as well as its wild cousins we should have enough fruit for blackberry icecream next summer. That’s providing we don’t pull them out by accident. \n Our other newcomer, the Thornless Youngberry  is a domesticated version of a berry that was itself first cultivated in the US in 1905. I’ve read that this variety doesn’t fruit quite as prolifically as the thorny youngberry , but with any luck it will be fully productive within three years. \n I’ve put both plants in a row with several two year-old jostaberry plants and a sprawling loganberry for company. \n There’s a huge range of blackberries and related soft fruit varieties on the market these days, and this excellent piece from the  TyTy Nursery in Georgia helps explain how they’ve been engineered into existence. Did you know, for instance that “the “Youngberry “was developed in 1905 in Morgan City, Louisiana; it is a cross between Luther Burbank’s, Phenomenal Berry, and the Austin-Mayes Dewberry , a trailing blackberry. This berry had excellent qualities, such as taste and high yields, and it soon replaced the Loganberry of California after its release”?

Nicknamed “The Tin Man”, and described as “as the best all-round jockey that the turf has ever seen”, Archer was the holder of several records which lasted deep into the 20th century. He was Champion Jockey for 13 consecutive years until 1886, claiming 2,748 victories from 8,064 starts. He won a total of 21 classic races, including Epson Derby five times. He committed suicide at the age of 29 after the loss of his wife during childbirth. \n Sir Gordon Richards (5 May 1904 – 10 November 1986) was one of the England’s finest jockeys, often considered the world’s greatest ever jockey. He is still the only jockey to have been knighted. Gordon Richard was the British flat racing Champion Jockey 26 times. He amassed a total of 4,870 winners, and a record 12 consecutive winners ridden. In 1999, the Racing Post (leading racing newspaper in Britain) placed him at number 1 in their list of the top 50 jockeys of 20th century. \n Lester Piggott (born 5 November 1935) – is a retired professional jockey and one of the most successful English flat racing jockeys of all time.

In singles matches each player operates two sets of coloured counters (winks) rather than one. There are 6 winks (4 small and 2 large) of each colour (blue, green, red and yellow). The game is played on a six foot by three felt mat with a pot placed in the centre. The winks are played by using a 'squidger'; this is any circular disc between 25 and 51 mm in diameter. Players use different squidgers for different shots (like selecting a club in golf). A player normally only plays a single shot in each turn, but is rewarded with an extra shot if they happen to pot a wink of their own colour. Play is time limited. Pairs matches last for 25 minutes and Singles matches last for 20 minutes, after which each colour has a further five rounds, ending with the colour that started. \n The aim of the game is to secure the highest number of table points ('tiddlies'). At the end of a normal game, three tiddlies are scored for each wink in the pot and one for each wink which remains uncovered by other winks on the mat. The player who scores most tiddlies gets four game points, the player who comes second gets two game points, and the player who comes third gets one game point. In pairs, partners add their points together. Thus there are always seven points in every game.

His father, who was also called Maurice, worked as a porter in a fish market, and his mother, Ellen, worked as a cook and a cleaning lady. When he was two-years-old, his brother, Stanley Victor, was born. \n A sickly child, Caine was born suffering from rickets. He grew up in South London, and attended Ruskin Infant's School in Camberwell from the age of four. Around the same time, he was first introduced to the cinema and enjoyed going to see 'The Lone Ranger' at the Saturday morning children's matinee. When World War II broke out in 1939, Michael and his little brother were briefly evacuated to Wargrave in Berkshire, but then returned to London to face the perils of 'the blitz'. Caine's mother then found accommodation for her family at North Runcton in Norfolk. US air bases were springing up all over the area, and it was here that young Michael was first introduced to chewing gum! \n After the war, Caine attended Wilson's Grammar School in Camberwell but left at the age of 16 with four O levels. He then underwent his compulsory period of National Service, and served in the Royal Fusiliers in Germany; he also did a tour of combat duty during the Korean War. After leaving the army, Caine's acting career began in Sussex, when he took a job as an assistant stage manager for the Westminster Repertory Company, which was based in Horsham. He then succeeded in securing a few walk-on roles at the Carfax Theatre, which gave him his first experience of stage acting. \n He had now been bitten by the acting bug in earnest. During his early years as an aspiring actor, Caine shared a flat with fellow actor Terence Stamp: the two men became firm friends and have remained so ever since. After a few minor TV appearances and walk-on roles at the Carfax Theatre, he got his first proper \"break\" as an upper-class British officer Gonville Bromhead in the film 'Zulu'. This was something of a breakthrough for Caine, as he epitomised the \"working class hero\" type of actor with his authentic cockney accent. \n Moreover, it established him firmly as a leading player in the cinema and opened the door to a string of exciting offers during the 1960s. After the success of 'Zulu', he played two of his most famous roles: namely, the role of a roguish womaniser in 'Alfie' (1966), and the spy Harry Palmer in the film, 'The Ipcress File' (1965), a cold war thriller based on the novels of bestselling author Len Deighton. Caine reprised the role of Palmer in two further movies, 'Funeral in Berlin' (1966) and 'Billion-Dollar Brain' (1967). \n Although Caine had not yet achieved major success in Hollywood, it was not long before the offers started to pour in. He made his first film in America in 1966, after receiving an invitation from Shirley MacLaine to act alongside her in a movie called 'Gambit'. Whilst working on 'Gambit', Caine was also introduced to the screen idol John Wayne, who became one of his closest friends, as well as the agent Swifty Lazar. The 1960s were a phenomenally successful time for Michael Caine, despite the fact that he did not win an Oscar. In 1969, he made yet another hit movie, 'The Italian Job', alongside the legendary actor Sir Noel Coward, and that same year, he played an RAF fighter pilot in the movie, 'Battle of Britain'. \n As the 1970s dawned, he consolidated his hard-won screen success. In 1971, he made the movie 'Get Carter', a classic British gangster story. He then played opposite Sir Laurence Olivier, who was arguably the leading actor of his generation in the classic thriller, 'Sleuth'", "parametric_answer": "too late hero", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}
{"question": "In which sitcom did Penelope Wilton play the wife of Richard Briers?", "answers": ["ever decreasing circles"], "context": "Richard Briers - TelegraphRichard Briers - Telegraph \n Obituaries \n Richard Briers \n Richard Briers, the actor, who has died aged 79, played the engaging free    spirit who strove for a self-sufficient lifestyle in Surbiton in BBC    Television’s classic 1970s comedy series The Good Life. \n Briers (left) as Tom Good in The Good Life with Felicity Kendal (Barbara), Paul Eddington (Jerry) and Penelope Keith (Margo) Photo: BBC \n 6:03PM GMT 18 Feb 2013 \n Although acclaimed on television for a style of dithering comedy which reminded an earlier generation of the Aldwych farceur Ralph Lynn, Briers also proved adept in serious roles in the classics. In Kenneth Branagh’s 1997 film of Hamlet, his Polonius was praised by one critic for its “conspiratorial edge”. \n In The Good Life Briers played the hapless Tom Good, a draughtsman who decided to abandon the office rat race and live off the land. Instead of moving to the country, however, he and his wife Barbara (Felicity Kendal) eviscerated the lawn at their suburban home, planted vegetables and kept livestock — all to the horror of their relentlessly middle-class next door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter (Penelope Keith and Paul Eddington). \n With his omnipresent grin and boyish mannerisms, Briers proved perfect for the role. The Goods’ attempts to be truly self-sufficient were constantly thwarted by the machinations of the snobbish Margo, who feared that they were lowering the tone of the neighbourhood beyond repair; but Tom and Barbara always laughed in the face of adversity, and never lost their affection for their tormentor. \n Written by John Esmonde and Bob Larbey and screened in 30 episodes between 1975 and 1978, The Good Life was probably Briers’s most famous vehicle on television. It was “a happy and somewhat rare combination of intelligent writing and superb playing”, judged the television critic of The Daily Telegraph. \n From 1984 to 1987 Briers starred in another popular sitcom, Ever Decreasing Circles. Also written by Esmonde and Larbey, it featured an obsessive, middle-aged fusspot whose settled routine is unexpectedly threatened by a flashy rival for his wife’s affections. Penelope Wilton played his long-suffering wife and Peter Egan the too-smooth neighbour. \n Related Articles \n Richard Briers in pictures \n 18 Feb 2013 \n It all seemed a far cry from Briers’s earnest portrayal of the Dane in a student production at Rada of Hamlet, when his naturally rapid delivery led WA Darlington of The Daily Telegraph to liken him to “a demented typewriter”. Yet with his sense of timing, air of hapless innocence and his ability to keep the straightest of faces amid the mayhem typical of his brand of embarrassed humour, it was no great surprise that Briers went on to become one of Britain’s leading practitioners of farce and light comedy. \n Briers continued to be offered television work, and starred as the Rev Philip Lambe in All In Good Faith (1985-88). Lambe, the former vicar of an affluent rural parish, had to knuckle down to life in a tough Midlands city and meet its challenging problems. But after Briers’s conspicuous success at the BBC, this series — his first for ITV — was reckoned a disappointment. \n Richard David Briers was born on January 14 1934 at Merton, Surrey. His father, Joe Briers, was, among other things, a bookmaker, but found it hard to hold down a job and frittered away money in pubs. “[He was] a smashing man,” his son recalled, “but he was never settled in one job, and he was not as ambitious or acquisitive as I am. We were always on the edge, so I grew up in a slightly tense atmosphere.” \n The family lived at Raynes Park, south-west London, and occasionally received handouts from a wealthy relation. Richard was educated at Ridgeway School in Wimbledon, where he failed to shine scholastically — “I never even got a Z-level” — but showed an interest in acting.

{"question": "Which shipping forecast area is directly north of German Bight?", "answers": ["fisher"], "context": "Shipping ForecastThe Shipping Forecast is a BBC Radio broadcast of weather reports and forecasts for the seas around the coasts of the British Isles.  It is produced by the Met Office and broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. The forecasts sent over the Navtex system use a similar format and the same sea areas. The waters around the British Isles are divided into 31 sea areas, also known as weather areas (see map below)  There are four broadcasts per day at the following (UK local) times: \n * 0048 – transmitted on FM and LW. Includes weather reports from an extended list of coastal stations at 0052 and an inshore waters forecast at 0055 and concludes with a brief UK weather outlook for the coming day. The broadcast finishes at approximately 0058. \n * 0520 – transmitted on FM and LW. Includes weather reports from coastal stations at 0525, and an inshore waters forecast at 0527. \n * 1201 – normally transmitted on LW only. \n * 1754 – transmitted only on LW on weekdays, as an opt-out from the PM programme, but at weekends transmitted on both FM and LW. \n The unique and distinctive sound of these broadcasts has led to their attracting an audience much wider than that directly interested in maritime weather conditions.

In 1911, the Met Office began issuing marine weather forecasts which included gale and storm warnings via radio transmission for areas around Great Britain. This service was discontinued during and following the First World War, between 1914 and June 1921, and again during the Second World War between 1939 and 1945.  \n Today, although most ships have onboard technology to provide the Forecast's information, they still use it to check their data. \n On Friday 30 May 2014, for the first time in more than 90 years, the BBC failed to broadcast the Shipping Forecast at 5:20 am. Staff at Broadcasting House were reading out the report but it was not transmitted.

Later modifications include the introduction of Fisher in 1955, when Dogger was split in two. Heligoland was renamed German Bight a year later. Around 1983, the Minches sea area was merged with Hebrides. In 1984, the areas in the North Sea were coordinated with those of neighbouring countries, introducing North Utsire and South Utsire and reducing Viking in size. Finisterre was renamed FitzRoy in 2002, to avoid confusion with the (smaller) sea area of the same name used in the marine forecasts produced by the French and Spanish meteorological offices.  Some names still differ; for example, the Dutch KNMI names the area equivalent to Forties after the Fladen bank, while Météo-France calls the English Channel sea areas Dover, Wight, Portland, and Plymouth respectively Pas de Calais, Antifer, Casquets, and Ouessant.  \n In the forecast, areas are named in a roughly clockwise direction, strictly following the order above.

And, for just as long as they’ve been around, there have been complaints about them: ‘Who are the people who comprise the focus groups?’, ‘Do they have any insider movie knowledge?’, ‘Why are they more knowledgeable than the screenwriters and directors who have made the film?’, “Why are studios changing the ending of a movie just because a few random people disliked it?’. A few years back, the Academy Award’s writers perhaps best satirized the focus group in a sketch (check it out here if you’re interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh6mCImeylE ). One of the best stories I have ever heard about a focus group that actually worked in the director’s favour is in relation to the 1981 movie Time Bandits. Terry Gilliam explained that the focus group screening in Fresno was a disaster, as the sound did not function properly for a good portion of the film. By the time it was fixed, a large number of the audience had departed. The motion picture has a rather controversial finale, yet the movie watchers that remained sardonically claimed that the ending was their favourite part (simply because the nightmarish experience was over). When the higher-ups received the breakdown of the cards filled out from the previous day, they witnessed what they thought was an off-the-charts appreciation for the ending – which Gilliam claims aided Time Bandits in keeping the original conclusion. \n Time Bandits was recommended to me by actor/director G.J. Echternkamp. He has appeared in an episode of How I Met Your Mother, as well as in films like Hard Candy and Extraordinary Measures. He has also directed the award winning 2007 documentary Frank and Cindy, as well as the 2015 feature film of the same name. He is currently working on the newest Death Race film, Death Race 2050 starring Manu Bennett and Malcolm McDowell. When I spoke to him about his favourite film on the closing night of the inaugural St. Lawrence International Film Festival, he promptly highlighted Time Bandits as his top pick. Check out the interview below to hear a great explanation as to why it is his selection, as well as a rendition of an iconic quotation from his film Frank and Cindy. \n Written by Monty Python alumni Michael Palin and the film’s director Terry Gilliam, the story follows a young boy named Kevin (Craig Warnock) as he is swept up by a group of disgruntled dwarves (who are tired of working for the Supreme Being – so they have stolen his map that shows the space/time breaks in the fabric of the universe) and taken on a journey through time as they attempt to rob some of the richest people in the world’s legendary history. \n Their first stop takes them to France, where they meet the irascible Napoleon Bonaparte (Ian Holm), who is more interested in observing short people perform for him (or reciting famed historic figures of short stature) than in strategizing about the war that he is in the middle of. Kevin and the team of dwarves, which include Randall (David Rappaport), Fidgit (Kenny Baker – R2-D2 from Star Wars), Strutter (Malcolm Dixon), Og (Mike Edmonds), Wally (Jack Purvis) and Vermin (Tiny Ross), are hired as generals by the French leader following a chaotically violent rendition of ‘Me and My Shadow’ (that Napoleon loves). They rob the man blind and escape to the Middle Ages, where they meet a jovial Robin Hood (John Cleese), who is full of handshakes and generic questions. He mistakenly interprets that the dwarves are gifting the treasure they’ve just stolen to him in order to help the poor (who he says the dwarves will really like). \n It is at this point that we learn that Evil (David Warner), a Satan stand-in, is watching the bandits.

Why did he later release a dove (Genesis 8)? \n Why did Noah release a raven? Why did he later release a dove (Genesis 8)? \n   \n Subscribe to our Question of the Week : \n Question: \"Why did Noah release a raven? Why did he later release a dove (Genesis 8)?\" \n Answer: Following the Genesis flood, as the ark was resting on Mount Ararat, Noah released a raven and dove from the ark at different times. The goal in sending these birds was to determine if the flood waters had abated enough for Noah and his family to exit the ark. \n In Genesis 8:6-7 we read, “At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made and sent forth a raven. It went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth.” The “40 days” here is after the tops of the mountains were visible (verse 5), over seven months after the flood began. A raven was released and apparently never returned. No reason is provided regarding why a raven was selected rather than another bird. However, raven can eat carrion and would feed off dead animals in the water. A dove, on the other hand, would return to its point of origin if no land was found. \n Noah sent a dove in Genesis 8:8-9: “Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground. But the dove found no place to set her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her and brought her into the ark with him.” The dove returned with no indication that a place had been found to alight. \n A week later, in Genesis 8:10-11, Noah sent the dove again: “He waited another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark. And the dove came back to him in the evening, and behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth.” Things had begun to grow once again; the earth was becoming more habitable. \n Another week passed. Then, in Genesis 8:12, Noah sends out the dove one more time: “Then he waited another seven days and sent forth the dove, and she did not return to him anymore.” The dove had no need to return to the ark, since it had found a home on land. The ark could soon be emptied, and humanity could begin to establish itself again in the world. \n From Genesis 7:11 to 8:14, we know that the flood lasted a total of one year and ten days. The raven and the dove were released over a period of 21 days after the mountaintops became visible (Genesis 8:10-12). The raven served as a first attempt to discover dry land, and the dove became Noah’s way of determining when to leave the ark.

Christened and launched on Thursday, June 7, 1906. Lusitania met a disastrous end as a casualty of the First World War when she was torpedoed by the German submarine U-20 on May 7, 1915. The great ship sank in just 18 minutes, eight miles (15 km) off the Old Head of Kinsale, Ireland, killing 1,198 of the people aboard. The sinking turned public opinion in many countries against Germany. \n RMS Mauretania, sister ship of the Lusitania, was an ocean liner built by Swan, Hunter & Wigham Richardson at Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, and was launched on September 20, 1906. At the time, she was the largest and fastest ship in the world. Particularly notable was her steam turbine propulsion, which was a revolutionary development in ocean liner design. Mauretania became a favourite among the passengers,[1] attributable to her luxury, speed, and safety. \n The ship's name was taken from Mauretania a Roman Province on the northwest African coast, not related to the modern Mauritania. Similar nomenclature was also employed by Mauretania's sister ship, the Lusitania, which was named after the Roman province directly north of Mauretania, across the Strait of Gibraltar. \n The Mauretania is depicted with red and black funnels.

The territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2)  and with over 320 million people, the United States is the world's third largest country by total area (and fourth largest by land area) and the third most populous. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of  large-scale immigration from many other countries.  The geography and climate are also extremely diverse, and the country is home to a wide variety of wildlife.  \n Paleo-Indians migrated from Asia to the North American mainland at least 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the United States by Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire.Greene, Jack P.; Pole, J.R., eds. (2008). A Companion to the American Revolution. pp. 352–361. The current constitution was adopted in 1788, after the Articles of Confederation, adopted in 1781, were felt to have provided inadequate federal powers.

She went on regular progresses and was even known to pop into someone’s house for tea. \n Elizabeth idolised her father and loved talking about him. She also enjoyed standing in front of his portrait to receive visitors so that they could see that she was her “father’s daughter”. \n Elizabeth never married, although she had many suitors, but believed that she was wedded to her kingdom. \n She drove her council and advisers mad with the way she procrastinated. \n Elizabeth loved reading history books and would try to dedicate three hours a day to reading them. \n Here are even more facts about Queen Elizabeth I:- \n When angry, she would calm herself by translating great works. \n She was “a very merciful lady” (William Cecil’s words) and hated executions. \n Elizabeth was strict with money and generally managed to live within her budget of £300,000 a year, turning England from a debt-ridden country into a prosperous one. \n Elizabeth tickled her beloved Dudley’s neck when making him Earl of Leicester. \n She was known for swearing and spitting when she was angry. \n She loved flirting, jokes and jests, and was known for her wit. \n Elizabeth excelled at riding and also loved dancing and hunting. \n She was fluent in many languages – It is said that by the age of 11 she was fluent in six languages and that she went on to become knowledgeable in around 9. \n She was a skilled musician. \n Like many of her time, she was superstitious and often consulted Dr John Dee, an astrologer. \n She may have been claustrophobic – She liked her windows open, hated loud noises and crowds. Perhaps this hearkens back to her time in the Tower. \n Elizabeth was very conscious of smells and hated any strong smell, such as kitchen odours. \n Like her father, Henry VIII, she had problems in later life with a leg ulcer. \n She was fond of making her own recipes for ailments. \n Rmour has it that she had over 3,000 gowns – Perhaps this goes back to her childhood when Lady Bryan had to beg Henry VIII for clothes for the young Elizabeth because she had grown out of everything and had nothing to wear. \n She loved lavish clothes and jewels. \n Elizabeth was rather vain and did not like “realistic” portraits to be painted. \n She never met Mary Queen of Scots. \n Although England under Elizabeth I was Protestant, she was tolerant of Catholicism and famously said “We have no wish to open windows into men’s souls.” \n Elizabeth survived smallpox and wore heavy makeup to conceal her scars. \n She had a locket ring with miniatures of herself and her mother, Anne Boleyn, hidden in it. \n There are many more wonderful facts about this Queen but looking through those, I can really see that not only was she her “father’s daughter", "parametric_answer": "queen victoria", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

Over it have flown the flags of Holland, England, and the United States; and for a brief time it was lent to the French Government. It has also belonged to the corporation of New York City, to the State, and to several private owners. \n The Mohegan Indians called it \"Minnissais, meaning Lesser Island. At various times it has been known as \"Great Oyster,\" \"Love Island,\" \"Bedloo's Island,\" \"Kennedy's Island,\" \"Corporation Island,\" \"Bedlow's Island\"an anglicized form of the original owner's nameand now \"Bedloe's,\" a spelling for which there is no historical basis. \n Under Dutch sovereignty the island became the property of Isaack Bedloo, merchant and \"select burgher\" of New Amsterdam, who was born in Calais, France. His name was listed with 94 others in the \"Remonstrance of the People of New Netherlands to the Director-General and Council\"a protest of public-spirited citizens to Holland against certain intolerable conditions. So it was not surprising that under English rule the island was formally granted to him by Governor Nicolls of New York. \n Bedloo is believed to have died in 1673. His estate retained the island until 1732, when his daughter Mary sold it to Adolphe Philipse and Henry Lane for 5 shillings. During their ownership the island was temporarily commandeered as the first quarantine station by the city, which feared \"that small-pox and other malignant fevers may be brought in from South Carolina, Barbadoes, Antigua, and other places, where they have great mortality.\" \n In 1746, Archibald Kennedy bought the island for the sum of £100, for use as a summer home. During his ownership the State ordered the erection of a beacon on Bedloe's Island, for the purpose of warning New Jersey, Connecticut, and New York of the approach of an enemy. \n In 1756, the Governor of New York instructed Kennedy, as presiding councillor of New York, to exercise all possible. precautions to prevent the introduction of smallpox, which was then raging in Philadelphia. Kennedy permitted the use of his island again as a temporary quarantine station. In 1759, the Corporation of the City of New York bought the island for £1,000 to erect a pest-house. During the next few years it was leased to several different persons for varied periods of time. \n When the English occupied New York they seized Bedloe's Island and used it as a refuge for Tory sympathizers. Objecting to this use, rebels managed to set fire to all the buildings on the island and to do other damage. \n The French came into the picture in 1793, using Bedloe's Island as an isolation station for 3 years. In 1796, the island was conveyed to the ownership of New York State for use as a hospital site or any other desired purpose. \n By this time steps had been taken by the newly organized Federal Government, in conjunction with the State, to erect fortifications to protect New York Harbor. Three sitesGovernor's Island, Ellis Island, and Bedloe's Islandwere chosen for defense fortifications, and on February 15, 1800, by act of the New York Legislature, the three islands were ceded to the United States Government. \n Outer battery, Fort Wood, 1890. \n Construction of a land battery, in the shape of an 11-point star, was begun on Bedloe's Island in 1806 and finished 5 years later.

Is it mentioned in Arkansas State Laws? \n As a subnote, Wikipedia mentions the below: \n In 1881, the pronunciation of Arkansas with the final \"s\" being silent was made official by an act of the state legislature after a dispute arose between Arkansas's then-two U.S. senators as one favored the pronunciation as /ˈɑrkənsɔː/ AR-kən-saw while the other favored /ɑrˈkænzəs/ ar-KAN-zəs. \n 2 \n   \n Even if such a law were on the books, it would likely be held unconstitutional and thus technically, not a law in the U.S. –  RBarryYoung Oct 23 '14 at 15:10 \n    \n   \n Agreed, that would be a clear 1st amendment violation. –  Andrew Medico Oct 23 '14 at 15:34 \n 2 \n   \n Cf.: Just because \"New York City\" is the official name, you won't get arrested for calling it \"The Big Apple\". –  Hagen von Eitzen Oct 23 '14 at 18:19 \n 3 \n   \n Your question rhymes!

Preventing speech in the first place (i.e. as opposed to the question of what legal consequences are allowed) is just a narrow subset of First Amendment law, not the whole thing; there's probably more that's been written about whether a vague law causes self-censorship to avoid violating it than about prior restraint of speech. –  cpast Oct 25 '14 at 5:07 \n The name, Arkansas, is a French pronunciation of a Siouxan word meaning \"land of downriver people\". It is pronounced: \n /ˈɑrkənsɔː/ \n In 1881, the Arkansas General Assembly passed Concurrent Resolution No. 4. \n The resolution was further modified in 1947 as Arkansas Code 1 April 105, and reads thusly: \n Whereas,   confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of   our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation   should be determined for use in oral official proceedings. And,   whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State   Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have   agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history, and the   early usage of the American immigrants. Be it therefore resolved by   both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation   of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that   received by the French from the native Indians and committed to   writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be   pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final \"s\" silent, the \"a\"   in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first   and last syllables. The pronunciation with the accent on the second   syllable with the sound of \"a\" in \"man\" and the sounding of the   terminal \"s\" is discouraged by Arkansans. \n The full explanation of the debate leading up to this resolution can be read here . \n Essentially, this resolution was just to make the proper pronunciation \"official\".

While his parched and effeminate falsetto recalls Gasoline Alley -era Rod Stewart with a healthy dose of Antony and the Johnsons , it's the late Elliott Smith who casts the largest shadow on Back to Bedlam . Predictable but effective four-chord guitar motifs are the chosen vehicle for the ex-Royal Armed Forces soldier, and when they connect (\"Wiseman,\" \"Goodbye My Lover,\" \"You Are Beautiful\"), it's like a \"Dear John\" letter from a lover who you know will remain a close but ultimately guarded friend. Opening track \"High\" sets a determined midtempo pace that rarely wanes -- it's like an acoustic version of \"Drive\" by the Cars with a Coldplay chorus. It's a pace that would sink some records, but Bedlam 's perfectly rendered, under 40-minute run time ensures that the listener doesn't suffer from a melancholy overdose. Blunt recounts his harrowing experiences as part of the NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo on the closer, \"No Bravery,\" and it's a shock to hear all of the romantic lyricism that informed Bedlam up to this point reduced to \"Old men kneel and accept their fate/Wives and daughters cut and raped/A generation drenched in hate,\" but it's damn effective -- as is the majority of this fine debut. \n Track Listing  Feature Album - Back To Bedlam by James Blunt | Jesse ...Feature Album - Back To Bedlam by James Blunt | Jesse Mulligan, 1–4pm,  2:50 pm on 11 November 2008 | Radio New Zealand \n Feature Album - Back To Bedlam by James Blunt \n From Jesse Mulligan, 1–4pm , 2:50 pm on 11 November 2008 \n Share this \n To embed this content on your own webpage, cut and paste the following: \n <iframe src=\"http://www.radionz.co.nz/audio/remote-player?id=1780445\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"62px\"></iframe>  James Blunt: Back to Bedlam - Music on Google PlayJames Blunt: Back to Bedlam - Music on Google Play \n 1 20 \n Jodie Gentsch \n Back to Bedlam James Blunt....still one of the very best cd's i ever did purchase...it got scratched up years ago...i was thinking about how much i adored this whole album...so i gifted myself with this man again and his music!

Audio file courtesy of the Acoustic Atlas at Montana State University (www.acousticatlas.org) \n   \n General Description \n The Uinta Chipmunk is a medium-sized chipmunk, with moderately distinct dorsal stripes and generally warm brownish pelage on the flanks, shoulders, and head. In some regions they may be difficult to distinguish from other chipmunk species by sight. The outermost stripe is white bordered by brown, not black. It is more likely to be seen in trees than other chipmunks sharing its range (Bergstrom 1999). Adults may attain the following body measurements: total length 200 to 243 millimeters; tail length 90 to 115 millimeters; hind foot 30 to 35 millimeters; ear 16 to 19 millimeters; weight 55 to 80 grams. Sexes are similar in size (Clark and Stromberg 1987). There are 22 teeth in the skull (dental formula: I 1/1, C 0/0, P 2/1, M 3/3), and the skull is more than 34 millimeters in length. \n Diagnostic Characteristics \n In Montana, the Uinta Chipmunk is sympatric only with the Least and Yellow-pine Chipmunks, and is larger than both. The outermost light dorsal stripe is white (not grayish or yellowish) and bordered by brown, not black as with other species; similarly all of the central dark dorsal stripes are brownish-black, not black as in the other Montana chipmunks. Unlike the Least Chipmunk, it tends to hold its tail horizontally rather than vertically when running, and is generally darker brownish rather than washed grayish or yellowish. Unlike the Yellow-pine Chipmunk, the belly is whitish. Gray-brown coloration on the face and head separate it from the Red-tailed Chipmunk, which is reddish in those body areas and does not occupy the same part of the state (Foresman 2012). \n Species Range \n Click the legend blocks above to view individual ranges. \n Western Hemisphere Range \n Summary of Observations Submitted for Montana \n Number of Observations: 6 \n (Click on the following maps and charts to see full sized version) Map Help and Descriptions \n Relative Density \n (Observations spanning multiple months or years are excluded from time charts) \n Migration \n No information is available on Uinta Chipmunk movements or home range size for Montana. The species is known elsewhere to be non-migratory; apparently only local movements are made. In Colorado, minimum convex polygon home ranges of radio-tracked individuals were 1.87 to 5.12 hectares, and home range lengths were 179 to 457 meters (Bergstrom 1988). \n Habitat \n Habitat use in Montana is unstudied and poorly described. The Uinta Chipmunk is found at high elevation in Carbon and southeastern Park Counties in subalpine forest and at treeline in krummholz vegetation, presumably subalpine fir-Engelmann spruce-whitebark pine (Pattie and Verbeek 1967). \n Elsewhere, Uinta Chipmunks are known to frequent coniferous forests at moderate to high elevations (to upper treeline). In Wyoming, they are reported occupying spruce-fir forest, lodgepole pine-Douglas-fir forest, and ponderosa pine forest (Clark and Stromberg 1987). In Colorado, they have been reported in ponderosa pine-Douglas-fir forest (Bergstrom 1988). In more southern regions of the global range, they are most often associated with ponderosa pine habitats, but also are found in drier pinyon pine-juniper woodlands; in California and Nevada they also are found in bristlecone pine woodlands (Bergstrom 1999). They often are found near logs and brush in open areas and at forest edges, sometimes in forest with a closed canopy but an open understory. They excavate burrows beneath rocks and shrubs, but also are arboreal to some degree, spending a fair amount of time in trees and sometimes sleeping and nesting in tree cavities. \n Ecological Systems Associated with this Species \n Details on Creation and Suggested Uses and Limitations \n How Associations Were Made \n We associated the use and habitat quality (common", "parametric_answer": "pine trees", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

{"question": "‘The Weeping Woman’ is the work of which artist?", "answers": ["pablo picasso", "picasso"], "context": "The Weeping Woman, 1937 by Pablo PicassoThe Weeping Woman, 1937 by Pablo Picasso \n The Weeping Woman, 1937 by Pablo Picasso \n Courtesy of www.PabloPicasso.org \n The Weeping Woman series is regarded as a thematic continuation of the tragedy depicted in Picasso's epic painting Guernica . In focusing on the image of a woman crying, the artist was no longer painting                           the effects of the Spanish Civil War directly, but rather referring to a singular universal image of suffering. \n Picasso's insistence that we imagine ourselves into the excoriated face of this woman, into her dark eyes, was part of his response to seeing newspaper photographs of the Luftwaffe's bombing of Guernica on behalf of Franco in the                           Spanish civil war on April 26, 1937. The Weeping Woman, 1937 came at the end of the series of paintings, prints and drawings that Picasso made in protest. It has very personal, Spanish sources. In May 1937 Picasso's mother                           wrote to him from Barcelona that smoke from the burning city during the fighting made her eyes water. The Mater Dolorosa, the weeping Virgin, is a traditional image in Spanish art, often represented in lurid baroque sculptures with                           glass tears, like the very solid one that flows towards this woman's right ear. Picasso's father, an artist, made one for the family home. \n The model for the painting, indeed for the entire series, was Dora Maar, who was working as a professional photographer when Picasso met her in 1936; she was the only photographer allowed to document the successive stages of Guernica while Picasso painted it in 1937. \n p> \n Dora Maar was Picasso's mistress from 1936 until 1944. In the course of their relationship, Picasso painted her in a number of guises, some realistic, some benign, others tortured or threatening. Picasso explained: \n For me she's the weeping woman. For years I've painted her in tortured forms, not through sadism, and not with pleasure, either; just obeying a vision that forced itself on me. It was the deep reality, not the superficial one...               Dora, for me, was always a weeping woman....And it's important, because women are suffering machines.” \n MOST POPULAR PAINTINGS  Picasso: Love & War 1935–1945Picasso: Love & War 1935–1945 \n Dation Pablo Picasso, Musée National Picasso, Paris, MP 165 \n © Pablo Picasso/Succession Pablo Picasso, Paris. Licensed by Viscopy, Sydney 2006 \n A Journey Through the Exhibition \n Weeping Woman Series \n Picasso returned to the theme of the Weeping Woman, first seen in Guernica clutching the body of her dead child, in a series of drawings, etchings and paintings made in September and October of 1937. These unsettling, emotive works are often read simplistically as mere descriptions of Dora's fiery temperament and the volatile nature of her relationship with Picasso. They are, however, far more complex and explore the fascinating dynamic between the works, the artist and the model. \n While the Weeping Women series embodies the essence of Picasso's beloved muse, Dora, it can also be read as a self–portrait revealing the inner torment of a man haunted by horrific images of the massacres taking place in the Spanish Civil War. In the artistic partnership between Dora and Picasso we again see the special empathy between the lovers, where Dora is not simply a model but an impassioned political accomplice (outraged by Fascism) deeply committed to conveying a powerful, universal message condemning war. Dora willingly submits her features to be brutally distorted and deconstructed by Picasso who contorts her beauty into a harsh ugliness to arouse raw human emotions of anguish, compassion and despair. \n The harrowing images that summarise the intense suffering of victims of war through the depiction of a desperate weeping woman have also been interpreted as a modern translation of the ancient Christian motif of the grief–stricken Virgin Mary mourning her dead son, Jesus Christ. \n While the Weeping Women vary enormously in colour and technique, the intensity of the expression in her eyes in each painting remains unchanged.

Over time, the name was Anglicized to Alcatraz. While the exact meaning is still                                     debated, Alcatraz is usually defined as meaning \"pelican\" or \"strange bird.\" \n In 1850, a presidential order set aside the island for possible use as a United States military reservation. The                                     California Gold Rush, the resulting boom in the growth of San Francisco, and the need to protect San Francisco Bay                                     led the U.S. Army to build a Citadel, or fortress, at the top of the island in the early 1850s. The Army also made                                     plans to install more than 100 cannons on the island, making Alcatraz the most heavily fortified military site on                                     the West Coast. Together with Fort Point and Lime Point, Alcatraz formed a \"triangle of defense\" designed to protect                                     the entrance to the bay. The island was also the site of the first operational lighthouse on the West Coast of the                                     United States. \n By the late 1850s, the first military prisoners were being housed on the island. While the defensive necessity of                                     Alcatraz diminished over time (the island never fired its guns in battle), its role as a prison would continue for                                     more than 100 years. In 1909, the Army tore down the Citadel, leaving its basement level to serve as the foundation                                     for a new military prison. From 1909 through 1911, the military prisoners on Alcatraz built the new prison, which was                                     designated the Pacific Branch, U.S. Disciplinary Barracks for the U.S. Army. It was this prison building that later                                     became famous as \"The Rock.\" \n The U.S. Army used the island for more than 80 years--from 1850 until 1933, when the island was transferred to                                     the U.S. Department of Justice for use by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The Federal Government had decided to                                     open a maximum-security, minimum-privilege penitentiary to deal with the most incorrigible inmates in Federal                                     prisons, and to show the law-abiding public that the Federal Government was serious about stopping the rampant                                     crime of the 1920s and 1930s. \n Life at the prison \n Correctional officers patrol \"broadway\" \n While several well-known criminals, such as Al Capone, George \"Machine-Gun\" Kelly, Alvin Karpis (the first                                 \"Public Enemy #1\"), and Arthur \"Doc\" Barker did time on Alcatraz, most of the prisoners incarcerated there                                 were not well-known gangsters, but prisoners who refused to conform to the rules and regulations at other Federal institutions, who were considered violent and dangerous, or who were considered escape risks. \n The average population                                 was only about 260-275 (the prison never once reached its capacity of 336 - at any given time, Alcatraz held less                                 than 1 percent of the total Federal prison population). Many prisoners actually considered the living conditions                                 (for instance, always one man to a cell) at Alcatraz to be better than other Federal prisons, and several inmates                                 actually requested a transfer to Alcatraz.  But while USP Alcatraz was not the \"America's Devil's Island\" that                                  books and movies often portrayed, it was designed to be a prison system's prison. \n If a man did not behave at another institution, he could be sent to Alcatraz, where                                 the highly structured, monotonous daily routine was designed to teach an inmate to follow rules and regulations.                                 At Alcatraz, a prisoner had four rights: food, clothing, shelter, and medical care. Everything else was a privilege                                 that had to be earned. Some privileges a prisoner could earn included: working, corresponding with and having visits                                 from family members, access to the prison library, and recreational activities such as painting and music.

{"question": "In the game of Bingo, ‘Get up and run’ represents which number?", "answers": ["31"], "context": "Bingo (U.S.)Bingo is a game of chance played with different randomly drawn numbers which players match against numbers that have been pre-printed on 5×5 cards.The cards may be printed on paper or card stock, or electronically represented, and are referred to as cards.  Many versions conclude the game when the first person achieves a specified pattern from the drawn numbers. The winner is usually required to call out the word \"Bingo!\", which alerts the other players and caller of a possible win.  All wins are checked to make sure the person has not made a mistake before the win is officially confirmed at which time the prize is secured and a new game is begun. In this version of bingo, players compete against one another for the prize or jackpot. \n Alternative methods of play try to increase participation by creating excitement.  Since its invention in 1929, modern bingo has evolved into multiple variations, with each jurisdiction's gambling laws regulating how the game is played.  There are also nearly unlimited patterns that may be specified for play.  Some games require only one number to be matched, while cover-all games award the jackpot for covering an entire card. There are even games that award prizes to players for matching no numbers or achieving no pattern. See \"Variations\" for more details. \n Bingo cards \n The most common Bingo cards are flat pieces of cardboard or disposable paper which contain 25 squares arranged in five vertical columns and five side to side rows. Each space in the grid contains a number. \n A typical Bingo game utilizes the numbers 1 through 75.  The five columns of the card are labeled 'B', 'I', 'N', 'G', and 'O' from left to right.  The center space is usually marked \"Free\" or \"Free Space\", and is considered automatically filled.  The range of printed numbers that can appear on the card is normally restricted by column, with the 'B' column only containing numbers between 1 and 15 inclusive, the 'I' column containing only 16 through 30, 'N' containing 31 through 45, 'G' containing 46 through 60, and 'O' containing 61 through 75. \n The number of all possible Bingo cards with these standard features is P(15,5) × P(15,5) × P(15,5) × P(15,5) × P(15,4) = 552,446,474,061,128,648,601,600,000 or approximately 5.52×1026. \n In U-Pick 'Em bingo and other variants of bingo, players are issued three 25 number cards which contain all 75 numbers that may be drawn.  Players then mark which numbers they wish to play and then daub those numbers according to the numbers drawn. In addition, double-action cards have two numbers in each square. \n A player wins by completing a row, column, or diagonal. The most chips one can place on a Bingo board without having a Bingo is 19, not counting the free space. In order for this to happen, only one empty cell can reside in each row and each column, and at least one empty cell must be in each diagonal, for instance: \n B I N G O \n ● ●   ● ● \n ●   ● ● ● \n ● ● □ ●   \n ● ● ●   ● \n   ● ● ● ● \n In addition to a straight line, other patterns may be considered a valid bingo in special games.

Another common special game requires players to cover the four corners. There are several other patterns, such as a Roving 'L', which requires players to cover all B's and top or bottom row or all O's and top or bottom row. Another common pattern is a blackout, covering all 24 numbers and the free space. \n Equipment \n The numbers that are called in a game of bingo may be drawn utilizing a variety of methods to randomly generate the ball call.

The flag had 13 horizontal stripes (probably of red and white or of red, white, and blue) and, in the canton, the first version of the British Union Flag ( Union Jack ). It was used at forts and on naval vessels. Another popular early flag, that of the Sons of Liberty , had the 13 stripes only.

The blue canton was to contain 13 stars, but the layout of the stars was left undefined, and several patterns are known. The designer of the flag, Congressman Francis Hopkinson , may have had a ring of stars in mind to symbolize (in the words of the flag law) “a new constellation.” Today that pattern is popularly known as the “ Betsy Ross flag,” although the claims of her descendants that she made the first Stars and Stripes and that she used the ring pattern are unsubstantiated. Rows of stars (4-5-4 or 3-2-3-2-3) were common, but other variations also existed. The new Stars and Stripes formed part of the military colours carried on Sept. 11, 1777, at the Battle of the Brandywine , perhaps its first such use. \n Similar Topics \n flag of the Confederate States of America \n The Stars and Stripes changed on May 1, 1795, when two more stars and two more stripes were added to reflect the admission to the union of Vermont (1791) and Kentucky (1792). (One such flag was the 1,260-square-foot [117-square-metre] “Star-Spangled Banner,” made by Mary Pickersgill, that Francis Scott Key saw at Fort McHenry in September 1814, inspiring his patriotic poem .) In 1818, after five more states had been admitted, Congress enacted legislation pertaining to a new flag, requiring that henceforth the number of stripes should remain 13, the number of stars should always match the number of states, and any new star should be added on the July 4 following a state’s admission. This has been the system ever since. In all, from 1777 to 1960 (after the admission of Hawaii in 1959) there were 27 versions of the flag—25 involving changes in the stars only. An executive order of Oct. 29, 1912, standardized the proportions and relative sizes of the elements of the flag; in 1934 the exact shades of colour were standardized. \n There is no official assignment of meaning or symbolism to the colours of the flag. However, Charles Thomson , secretary of the Continental Congress, in describing the proposed Great Seal, suggested the following symbolism: “White signifies purity and innocence, Red, hardiness & valour, and Blue…signifies vigilence, perseverence [sic] & justice.” As with many other national flags, the Stars and Stripes has long been a focus of patriotic sentiment .

The \"goat-man\" who gave his name to the Aegean Sea was, next to Poseidon, the father of Theseus, the founder of Athenian institutions and one of the kings of Athens. \n Upon the death of the king his father, Pandion II, Aegeus and his three brothers, Pallas, Nisos, and Lykos, took control of Athens from Metion, who had seized the throne from Pandion. They divided the government in four but Aegeas became king. His first wife was Meta and the second was Chalciope. \n Still without a male heir, Aegeus asked the Oracle at Delphi for advice. Her cryptic words were \"Do not loosen the bulging mouth of the wineskin until you have reached the height of Athens, lest you die of grief.\" Ignoring the oracle, Aegeus returned home by way of Troezen, where he was induced to father Theseus, perhaps drunkenly, and thus eventually did die of grief. \n An ancient subjugation of Athens to Crete is explained by the myth that while visiting in Athens, King Minos' son, Androgeus \"breeder of men\", managed to defeat Aegeus in every contest during the Panathenaic Games. Out of jealousy, Aegeus sent him to conquer the Marathonian Bull, which killed him. Minos was angry and declared war on Athens. He offered the Athenians peace, however, under the condition that Athens would send seven young men and seven young women every nine years to Crete to be fed to the Minotaur, a vicious monster. This continued until Theseus killed the Minotaur with the help of Ariadne, Minos' daughter. \n Aegeus' first wife was Meta and the second was Chalciope. Still without a male heir, Aegeus asked the Oracle at Delphi for advice. Her cryptic words were \"Do not loosen the bulging mouth of the wineskin until you have reached the height of Athens, lest you die of grief.\"Aegeus did not understand the prophecy and was disappointed. \n Aegeus went to Troezen where he was the guest of Troezen's king Pittheus. Pittheus understood the prophecy and introduced Aegeas to his daughter, Aethra, when he was drunk. They slept with each other and then, in some versions, Aethra waded out to the sea to the island of Sphairia, and bedded also with Poseidon. When she fell pregnant, Aegeus decided to go back to Athens. Before leaving, he covered his sandals, shield and sword under a huge rock and told her that when their son grew up, he should move the rock and bring the weapons back, by which sign his father would acknowledge him. Upon his return to Athens, Aegeus married Medea who had fled from Corinth and the wrath of Jason. Aegeus and Medea had one son together named Medus. \n In Troezen, Theseus grew up and became a brave young man. He managed to move the rock and took his father's arms. His mother then told him the identity of his father and that he should take the weapons back to him at Athens and be acknowledged. Theseus decided to go to Athens and had the choice of going by sea, which was the safe way, or by land, following a dangerous path with thieves and bandits all the way. Young, brave and ambitious, Theseus decided to go to Athens by land. \n When Theseus arrived, he did not reveal his true identity. He was welcomed by Aegeas, who was suspicious about the stranger who came to Athens. Medea tried to have Theseus killed by encouraging Aegeas to ask him to capture the Marathonian Bull, but Theseus succeeded. She tried to poison him, but at the last second, Aegeas recognized his sword and knocked the poisoned cup out of Theseus' hand.

{"question": "How many imperial gallons are in a firkin?", "answers": ["9"], "context": "What’s a Firkin? | Squared AwayWhat’s a Firkin? | Squared Away \n What’s a Firkin? \n by bloggle \n As we prepare for our first Firkin Crawl (say that 3 times fast), it occurred to us a little background info might be in order . . . i.e., what the firk’s a firkin? \n First of all, it’s just a fun word to say. Kinda like ‘arugula’. (you just said that out loud didn’t you?) The name derives from a Dutch word, vierdekijn (VEERD-kin), which means ‘fourth’. It’s an Old English unit of measurement, and amounts to about a quarter (fourth) of a full barrel. How much is a quarter barrel? Well obviously that depends a lot on the size of the barrel. \n \"can I interest you in a bit of firkin?\" \n The English have been using the firkin as a measurement for all kinds of things for hundreds of years. British records dating back to the early 1400’s list statutes for how much a firkin actually holds. The product being weighed or measured dictated the barrel size, and thus, the firkin size. In other words, firkins are fickle. A firkin of fish was 21 gallons; a firkin of soap, honey, or butter was around 8 gallons. (sadly, our research turned up no information on the size of a firkin of gherkins.) And, proving that the Brits have always been pretty serious about their suds, they had separate firkin measurements for beer and ale: a beer firkin was 9 gallons, an ale firkin 8 gallons. And those are imperial gallons, slightly larger than U.S. gallons (insert your own buxom British girls joke here). \n Firkin of soap. Not nearly as tasty. \n It really gets fun when you start looking at other forms of measurement from that era. A firkin was the smallest unit of liquid measurement where the barrel was concerned. It took 2 firkins to make a kilderkin, 4 to make a barrel, and 6 to make a hogshead. I can just see being in line at the beer store back then. “Can I get a couple of firkins to fill up my hogshead?” It just sounds dirty. \n OK but where does the tap go? \n Today’s craft beer firkins are 9 imperial gallons, 10.8 U.S. gallons. In brew-speak, about 72 pints of beer. Craft breweries like firkins for several reasons (outside of the fact everyone snickers every time someone says ‘firkin’); they allow for experimentation with existing beers, are naturally carbonated from being sealed in the firkin prior to the completion of fermentation, and are not pasteurized. That not only guarantees freshness when consumed, but allows for some interesting and subtle flavor changes since the brew’s yeast is still active. \n So don’t be a kilderkin. Get your firkin hoghead over to the pub and sample a barrel of cask-conditioned beer. And let us know what you think. \n Share this:  Liquid Measurements - Lehigh Valley Homebrewers - LVHBLehigh Valley Homebrewers \n 1 quart = 32 ounces = 4 cups = 2 pints = .95       liters \n 2 quarts = 64 ounces = 8 cups = 4 pints =       1.9 liters \n 4 quarts = 128 ounces = 16 cups = 8 pints =       3.8 liters = 1 gallon \n Gallons \n 1 gallon = 128 ounces = 8.35 pounds = 16       cups = 8 pints = 4 quarts = 3.8 liters = .833 Imperial       gallons \n 5.12 gallons = 1 sixtel = 1/3 keg = 1/6       barrel = 54.6 12-ounce beers = 2.28 cases of 12-ounce beers \n 7.75 gallons = 1 pony keg = 1/2 keg = 1/4       barrel = 82.6 12-ounce beers = 3.44 cases of 12-ounce beers \n 15.5 gallons = 1 keg = 1/2 barrel = 165.3       12-ounce beers = 6.89 cases of 12-ounce beers \n 31.5 gallons = 2 kegs = 1 barrel = 336       12-ounce beers = 14 cases of 12-ounce beers \n British Cask Sizes \n 1 pin = 4.5 Imperial gallons = 5.4 U.S.       gallons = .35 kegs \n 1 firkin = 9 Imperial gallons = 10.8", "parametric_answer": "14", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

He came to the United States with his family years before he would become one of contemporary art’s largest and most confusing personalities. \n In his early years, Guetta was a successful businessman who recognized the power of promotion. \n “When the sewing [on a shirt] was different, I’d call it ‘designer’ and charge $400,” said Guetta in “Exit Through the Giftshop.” \n Guetta was haunted by the death of his mother since he was a young child, and as a way of preserving family and friends, he picked up a video camera. During his life in the United States, Guetta filmed absolutely everything. He had several cameras set up inside his house to document his family’s life and always carried his personal camcorder with him, logging thousands of hours of eventless footage that he kept in large plastic tubs. \n On a visit to France, Guetta filmed his cousin, the street artist Space Invader . The experience changed Guetta’s life. He was drawn to the immediacy, impermanence and the danger of street art, and as he watched Invader install video game mosaics in Paris, he became fascinated with the role of street art in modern culture. \n “[The artists] really believed it, really loved it,” \n Guetta said later. “I started to really see a gallery outside.” \n After returning to the United States, Thierry spent 10 months following Shepard Fairey, the legendary creator of the Andre the Giant OBEY street piece. \n Fairey showed Guetta how to choose walls and how to avoid police detection, skills that Guetta would put to good use over the next several years. Guetta soon realized that he could create a street art documentary from his hundreds of hours of footage. \n He had a new purpose and life. Thierry stepped up his filming, meeting one street artist after another and logging a tremendous amount of footage, most of which sat in unmarked boxes in his Los Angeles home. He documented the creation of pieces by Buffmonsters, Borf, Swoon, Dotmasters, and eventually, Banksy. \n Thierry Guetta and Banksy \n The secretive Banksy was gaining recognition and infamy as an “art terrorist,” and Guetta was intrigued. However, despite his numerous connections in the international street art community, Guetta had no way to contact the legendary Englishman. \n As it turns out, is was Banksy who needed Guetta. During a visit to Los Angeles, Banksy’s area contact was detained by federal immigration enforcers. Banksy contacted Guetta through Shepard Fairey for help. \n The chance meeting became the genesis of Guetta’s career. Banksy took Guetta under his wing, allowing him to film everything he did and involving Guetta in many of his works. Guetta helped Banksy pull off a stunt at Disneyland that recalled Guantanamo Bay, and he was there filming Banksy’s famous painted elephant at a Los Angeles art show, asking viewers about the piece. Thierry had become one of Banksy’s closest friends and confidants. \n However, when Guetta showed Banksy the summary of his video work, a video called “Life Remote Control,” Banksy realized that Guetta’s talents were not in film making. \n “It was an hour and a half of unwatchable nightmare trailers,” Banksy said later. \n Banksy encouraged Thierry to make his own art, a journey that was documented in the Banksy-directed “Exit Through the Gift Shop,” which used many of Thierry’s thousands of hours of footage. \n “OBEY is about brainwashing,” Guetta said, explaining the nickname he assumed in his first forays into street art. “Banksy is about brainwashing.

{"question": "A sequicentenary is an anniversary of how many years?", "answers": ["150"], "context": "AnniversaryAn anniversary is a day that commemorates or celebrates a past event that occurred on the same date of the year as the initial event. For example, the first event is the initial occurrence or, if planned, the inaugural of the event. One year later would be the first anniversary of that event. The word was first used for Catholic feasts to commemorate saints. \n Anniversary names \n *Birthdays (v.) are the most common type of anniversary, where the birth date of a person is commemorated annually. The actual celebration is sometimes moved for practical reasons, as in the case of an official birthday. \n *Wedding anniversaries are also often celebrated on the same day of the year as the wedding occurred. \n * Death anniversary. \n The Latin phrase dies natalis (literally \"birth day\") has become a common term, adopted in many languages, especially in intellectual and institutional circles, for the anniversary of the founding (\"legal or statutory birth\") of an institution, such as an alma mater (college or other school). Even in ancient Rome, we know of the [dies] Aquilae natalis (\"birthday of the eagle\", anniversary of the official founding of a legion). \n Most countries around the world celebrate national anniversaries, for example the USA Bicentennial. These could be the date of independence of the nation or the adoption of a new constitution or form of government. The important dates in a sitting monarch's reign may also be commemorated, an event often referred to as a \"Jubilee\". \n Anniversaries of nations are usually marked by the number of years elapsed described with Latin words or Roman numerals. \n Latin-derived numerical names \n Latin terms for anniversaries are mostly straightforward, particularly those relating to the first twenty years (1–20), those relating to multiples of ten years (30, 40, 60, 70 etc.), and those relating to multiples of centuries or millennia (100, 200, 300, 1000, 2000, 3000 etc.) In these instances, the anniversary generally comes from a derivative of the Latin word for the respective number of years.  However, when anniversaries relate to fractions of centuries (125, 150, 175, 250 years—i.e., 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, and 2.5 centuries), the situation is not as simple. \n Roman fractions were based on a duodecimal system. From  to  they were described as multiples of twelfths (uncia \"twelfth\"; the source of the English words inch and ounce) and from  to  they were described as multiple-twelfths less than the next whole unit—i.e., a whole unit less ,  or  respectively. There were also special terms for quarter (quadrans), half (semis), and three-quarters (dodrans). Dodrans is a Latin contraction of de-quadrans which means \"a whole unit less a quarter\" (de means \"from\"; quadrans means \"quarter\".  Thus for the example of 175 years, the term is a quarter century less than the next whole (bi)century or 175 = (-25 + 200).  \n In Latin it seems that this rule did not apply literally for 1½. Whereas \"secundus\" is Latin for \"second\", or \"bis\" for \"twice\" these terms are not used such as in sesqui-secundus. Instead just sesqui (or ses) is used by itself. This may be because it relates to a ratio of one—thus it means \"and a half\" compared to \"one\". (It may also be because  in Latin is sescuncia, sescunciae (from sesqui- + uncia, i.e., 1½ uncias) defined as one-and-a-half twelfths ( ×  = ).) \n   \n Anniversary symbols \n Many anniversaries have special names. Etiquette in Society, in Business, in Politics and at Home by Emily Post, published in 1922, contained suggestions for wedding anniversary gifts for 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, and 75 years.

{"question": "‘The King of Barataria’ is the subtitle of which Gilbert and Sullivan operetta?", "answers": ["gondoliers", "king of barataria"], "context": "OPERETTA - 'GONDOLIERS' BY GILBERT & SULLIVAN - NYTimes.comOPERETTA -  'GONDOLIERS' BY GILBERT & SULLIVAN - NYTimes.com \n OPERETTA: 'GONDOLIERS' BY GILBERT & SULLIVAN \n By JOHN ROCKWELL \n Published: December 30, 1984 \n Since the lamentable demise of the D'Oyly Carte company, its premiere comic baritone, John Reed, has had to find other employment. He still manages to sing Gilbert & Sullivan parts in Britain, occasionally. But most of his activity now seems to be in that hotbed of Anglophilism, the prodigal colonies of the United States of America. Mr. Reed serves as stage director of the Colorado Music Festival in Boulder and appears in comic roles - mostly Gilbert & Sullivan, of course - hither and yon. \n ''Yon'' means Washington and Los Angeles, among others. ''Hither'' means the New York Gilbert & Sullivan Players at Symphony Space, where Mr. Reed appeared last season as King Gama in ''Princess Ida'' and where he opened a run of performances as the Duke of Plaza-Toro in ''The Gondoliers'' on Friday night. The run will continue, off and on, through Jan. 6, with a one-night coda Jan. 12 at the Palace Theater in Stamford, Conn. \n ''The Gondoliers,'' subtitled ''The King of Barataria,'' was the 12th collaboration between W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan. It was first performed at the Savoy Theater in London in December 1889, and counts as their last really popular work. \n The strains in their collaboration had to do with Sullivan's increasing ambitions as a serious composer. ''The Gondoliers'' contains far more developed music, and more extensive music, than the rest of the popular Savoyard canon. \n To this taste, that means it is less successful; the Americans were right in responding to this operetta cooly when it was first exported. Sullivan was a deft and tuneful craftsman, but the genius of these two lay in Gilbert's dialogue and patter songs and his improbable situations. In ''The Gondoliers,'' there is entirely too much song-and-dance frolicking to minimal comical purpose. \n Sullivan's musical ambitions, in turn, placed more stringent demands on the principal singers here than in most other Savoyard shows. Like most Gilbert & Sullivan troupes, English or American, the New York company is shy of really secure, attractive operatic voices. Much of the singing on Friday was thin at best, and smiling charm couldn't quite compensate. \n Still, Gilbert's wicked satire still surfaces in this score, and Mr. Reed and his cohorts made a nice turn of it. Actually, Mr. Reed seemed a little muted on this occasion, and was thus fully matched by Anthony Tamburello as the leeringly evil Grand Inquisitor; Mr. Tamburello is no great shakes as a singer, but he delivers comic dialogue superbly. And Keith Jurosko, in the shorter part of Luiz, made a wonderfully soulful, earnest comic-romantic. \n This is not to say that the other principals were unworthy of notice: Joanna Levy, Paul Tomasko, Richard Holmes, Carol Wolfe, Ellen Scrofani and Cheryl Fenner all had their merits. But greater musical distinction came from the pit, where Albert Bergeret led a nicely tuned, buoyantly idiomatic acount of the score, well played and with stalwart choral singing, as well. \n Mr. Bergeret, who founded this company in 1974, was also responsible for the stage direction, which was crisply managed if sometimes just a touch amateurishly executed. William Fleet Lively was the choreographer; Beverly Bullock and Edmond Felix did the colorful costumes, and Sally Small was credited with the simple lighting scheme. \n Mostly, as director, Mr. Bergeret stuck to tradition, with an occasional fresh touch not seen in every ''Gondoliers'' production (e.g., Inez, the foster mother who unravels - or is it ravels? - the plot at the end, as a violin-playing orchestra member plucked from the pit).

Across the center white stripe are two green five-pointed stars, spaced evenly in the center. \n The Syrian flag incorporates the four pan-Arab colors, which represent the various dynasties that ruled the region in history. The combination of colors was first used to represent the region during the 1916 Arab Revolt. \n The red symbolizes the Khawarij, an Islamic group of the seventh century, whose flag was red. The red also symbolizes the Hashemites. The white represents the Umayyad Dynasty, who used white as their color of mourning. The Umayyads Caliphate lasted from 661 to 750. Black symbolizes the Prophet Mohammad as well as the Abbasid Caliphate. The green, which is less prominent on the Syrian flag than on many other Arabic nations, represents the Fatimid Caliphate. Another set of meanings are ascribed to the colors in Syria's flag: red for the sacrifices made in the fight for freedom, white for peace, black for Syria's colonial history. \n Syrian Flag History \n The current flag of Syria was first adopted in 1958 when the United Arab Republic was formed, and when the union dissolved in 1961, the flag was no longer used. Later, on March 30, 1980, this flag was again adopted by Syria to represent the country's commitment to the Arab world. \n ACOD~20121221  Syria Flag - colors meaning history of Syria FlagSyria Flag - colors meaning history of Syria Flag \n Syrian Arabic Republic Flag \n Syria Flag - intorduction \n Today Syria is in crisis as a result of a civil war between forces favorable to the Mr. Bashar al-Assad of the Ba'ath Party and people opposed to his dictatorship.

By the time the next decade drew to a close, the world was going to hell in a hand basket out on the streets. Perhaps the singular characteristic of the era was that several new elements were introduced into the mystery mix over its course, including the perfect unbending TV cop for Richard Nixon’s law-and-order regime. \n The Defenders (1961-1965), while not solely a crime-oriented show, showed the power of the legal drama for confronting controversial issues. Car 54, Where Are You? (1961-1963) was the genre’s first sitcom. The Saint (1963-1969 in various incarnations) introduced one of print’s most enduring hero/rogues to TV. The Fugitive (1963-1967) showed how the classic man-on-the-run plotline was not only viable but compelling as it unfolded week after week on the small screen. The tension built up to one of the most-watched final shows in television history as Richard Kimball finally caught up with the man who had killed his wife. More an idea than a character in that he was not an active participant in the storyline until the final confrontation, “the one-armed man” is one of TV’s enduring villains. \n I Spy (1965-1968) brought spies to the fore–not to mention creating the medium’s first African-American hero, some fella named Cosby. Then Mission: Impossible (1966-1973) made intricate weekly espionage assignments standard fare, offering challenges (“Your mission, should you choose to accept it..”) which the IMF team never turned down. Meanwhile, back in the less high tech world of the traditional lone wolf PI, Honey West (1965-1966) suggested that a pretty girl need not just stand daintily off to the side waiting for a man to get the job done. Then, just to keep the PI world in its proper perspective, Mannix (1967-1975), dour and effective, did the tried and true hard-boiled thing. \n Ironside (1967-1975) became perhaps the best known of the many detectives over the years who refused to allow their physical handicaps to hinder the battle against crime. It also allowed Raymond Burr to separate himself from Perry Mason. The cultural war and youth revolution that was raging out in the real world did finally find expression of sorts in Mod Squad (1968-1973), featuring like, man, hip undercover operatives who would have left Joe Friday speechless. \n The decade closed with the debut of what was TV’s most controversial and, until Murder, She Wrote, longest-running crime drama, Hawaii 5-O (1968-1980). In a strange way, it probably reflected the argument that was tearing the country apart better than any other show. Fans debated whether the uncompromising attitude of Jack Lord’s Steve McGarrett was a matter of high principle or right wing pseudo-fascism.

These stories  portray the lapine heroes as they encounter various  aspects of rabbit life in the forms of natural forces  (i.e. weather and animal). The animals that are faced  are the ideal of that type. Yona the hedgehog for  example, shows how all hedgehogs act in relation to  rabbits. Even animals that are told of in pural such as  foxes are not exempt. Any fox encountered in a story is  the stereotypical example of all foxes, none having a  seperate personality. The stories provide two main  functions; first, they give rabbits a sense of history.  Stories are made to describe what has happened to rabbits  in the past and what brough them to the point they are at  today. Secondly, they provide rabbits with a sense of  confidence and self being as they learn of past rabbit's  exploits and abilities. Together, they give listeners ample entertainment and are a common source of moral  during times of stress. * Although all of the Sandleford rabbit's  stories are told vocally, rabbits in the Warren of Shining  Wires used 'shapes' made from pressing stones into warren  walls to tell traditional lapine myths. \n The Lapine Creation Story \n The lapine creation story is perhaps the most important  story within the rabbit world. A paraphrased version of  it is told here.    Before the world existed, there existed Frith. Frith  created the world and the stars with his droppings, and upon the world he created the rivers, mountians, plants  and animals. At the time of their creation, all animals  were the same. Both kestral and sparrow ate flies and  seeds, and the fox and rabbit were friends and ate grass  together. The first of the rabbits was named El-ahrairah  and he had wives without number. Because of El-ahrairah  and his many wives, the earth soon grew so densely populated  in rabbits that they ate all the grass, leaving the other  animals hungry, and so the animals began to complain to  Frith. Frith went to El-ahrairah and warned him that he  must keep his people under control, but El-ahrairah  said that he multiplied so to show his love of Frith  and his people did the same. Frith was angered by  El-ahrairah's impudent remark, but decided that the world  needed cunning and jest, so instead of killing El-ahrairah,  he chose to play a trick on him. So Frith called forth  all of the animals one by one in order to bestow upon them  a gift, making sure El-ahrairah would arrive last. When  the fox and stoat and weasel came, Frith gave them sharp  teeth and claws and the desire to hunt and kill all of  El-ahrairah's children. When El-ahrairah caught wind of  his new enemies, he started to dig a burrow in which to hide, and so when Frith came to him, El-ahrairah  was only half out of the ground. Frith asked El-ahrairah  to come out sohe may bless the rabbit, but El-ahrairah  refused so he may keep digging for his life. Encouraged  by the rabbit's determination even in the face of trial,  Frith gave to El-ahrairah strong legs with which to run,  and a tail that shone like a star to warn other rabbits  as he took flight. Frith also made this promise to  El-ahrairah: \"...All the world shall be your enemy, Prince with  a Thousand Enemies, and whenever they catch you, they will  kill you.

It’s a little troublesome in the beginning, before we know what the movie’s about. George is an extremely opaque character, and Jackie even more so—she wears sunglasses in her first scene, we don’t have an idea what she’s thinking. Things take off in the first barbershop scene: the film displays logic in Jackie’s denunciations; Jill’s entry & re-entry in wide shots, those tracks across the space, orient us to the real subject of the film—distraction; Ashby’s disorienting narrative detours become a vehicle both for elucidating the theme and for displaying his unmatched knack of creating unconventional rhythms within archetypal scenes—e.g. the obviously erotic hair-cutting scene, the “hide, it’s my husband!” scene… \n Review by Andrew Bemis ★★★★½ \n After rewatching Shampoo, I picked up Peter Biskind's bio of Warren Beatty where I'd left off a few years ago. I'm a sucker for stories about '70s Hollywood, but Biskind has a way of making even the good times sound like bad times - surely not every major talent of the era was an abusive, narcissistic prick. Whether or not Beatty is/was a narcissist, there's something to Biskind's suggestion that he's disarming any criticism of his womanizing ways in Shampoo by casting himself as a stud who genuinely empathizes with the women he sleeps with and, in the end, discovers that he's the one that's been used. Writing that makes it sounds like some kind of early Men's Rights manifesto,… \n 7 \n Just like The In-Laws, that I revisited recently, there were a handful of movies that I watched every shift in my old hotel Pay Per View job. Hal Ashby’s seminal Shampoo was also in that rarified group. It probably even one-up’d The In-Laws, as I seem to remember watching it every single time I played it. \n Why? Not for Ashby and screenwriters Robert Towne and star Warren Beatty’s dark critique of American mores and excesses at a turning point in the country’s history ( the film being set on the election night of Richard Nixon at the end of the 1960’s, and made just following his resignation in disgrace 5 years later ).

{"question": "Round the Clock, Hare and Hounds, Cricket and Shanghai are all games played on which type of board?", "answers": ["dartboard", "dart board", "darts"], "context": "Bullseye TV Game Show - DartsBullseye TV Game Show - Darts \n Darts \n General Rules of the Standard Dart Games \n 701,501, 301 \n The order of play is either determined by a toss of a coin or by each player throwing for the centre bull the nearest being the player that throws first. The rules here can vary depending on the league you may be playing in; the local rules should be observed at all times. \n Once the order of play has been determined the winner will start leg one and odd legs after that. The looser will start leg two and even legs thereafter. \n A throw consists of three darts except were the game is finished in less. \n Darts can not be re-thrown this includes darts that miss the board and darts that bounce of the board wiring system. Only darts that have their points touching the scoring area of the board score. \n A player may be told, if he asks, what number they scored, or what number he requires for the game, by the score announcer, but not how to get it. \n If the number required for the game is exceeded in the course of a throw, throw ceases, and no account is taken of the score obtained during that throw. \n The inner bull (50) counts as double of (25) the outer bull. \n The game is to score 701, 501 or 301 as previously agreed. \n Scoring \n Generally each player’s score must start and finish a game with a double (The outer narrow ring of the board). Competition games, however, are usually played with a straight start (no compulsory double) but with a compulsory double to finish. \n The first throw is deducted from the player’s start number e.g. 501 and then from the subsequent reduced total. The scorer should show both the score obtain for the throw and the reducing total remaining. \n For fast practise games play 301. For league and competition 501 and for pairs 701. In fact any agreed starting number can be used but usually the number should end 01 the reason for this is so a player must hit another part of the board other than the 20’s segment in order to win a game. \n Cricket (American Style) \n This game is played on a traditional standard dart board. \n The objective shall be to ‘own’ or ‘close’ certain numbers on the board, and to achieve the highest point score. The player or team to do so first, shall be the winner. \n Cricket shall be played using the numbers 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15 and both the inner and outer bull. \n Each player or team shall take turns in throwing. (Three darts in succession shall constitute a ‘turn’.) \n To close an inning, the player or team must score three of a number. This can be accomplished with three singles, a single and a double, or a triple. \n Once a player or team scores three of a number, it is ‘owned’ by that player or team and they can score on this number ‘runs’ until the opposing player or team have ‘closed’ it and no further scoring can be accomplished on that number by either player or team. \n To close the bullseye, the outer bull counts as a single, and the inner bull counts as a double. \n Numbers can be ‘owned’ or ‘closed’ in any order desired by the individual player/team. Calling your shot is not required. \n For the purpose of ‘owning’ a number, the double and triple ring shall count as 2 or 3, respectively. Three marks will close an inning. \n After a number is ‘owned’ by a team, the double and triple ring shall count as 2 or 3 times the numerical values, respectively. \n Winning the game: \n The player or team that closes all innings first and has the most points, shall be declared the winner. \n If both sides are tied on points, or have no points, the first player or team to close all innings shall be the winner", "parametric_answer": "snooker", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

Blinky was briefly seen in one of the first full length episodes of the series, \" Homer's Odyssey \". Blinky, or some other non-eaten member of his species, has made a variety of other cameo appearances since then, such as in \" Homer's Paternity Coot \". This has been done as a recurring joke about the environmental effects of Mr. Burns's Springfield Nuclear Power Plant , including appearances of other 3, 4, and 6 eyed fish and a highly mutated muscular humanoid form reminiscent of the Creature from the Black Lagoon . A 3-eyed whale similar to Blinky was seen at the end of \" Future-Drama \". In \" Lisa's Wedding \" in the future he is shown having six eyes. In \" Rednecks and Broomsticks \" several Blinkies get blinded by the moonshine in Springfield River. \n In the episode \" Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish \", he was caught by Bart Simpson . Mr. Burns defends the fish, saying that it is the next step in evolution , rather than having been mutated by toxic waste pouring out of the sewers and into the river from the nuclear plant. Mr. Burns later goes to the Simpsons's house for a meal to help his race for governor. Marge deliberately serves Blinky for dinner. Mr. Burns spits the fish out and loses the election to Mary Bailey . \n A miniature Blinky fish can be seen in one of the defective bottles of beer when Homer visits the Duff Brewery in \" Duffless \". \n Blinky also made a brief appearance in an underwater section of tube-way Fry travels through in the pilot episode of the animated series Futurama , which was co-created by Simpsons creator Matt Groening . \n Professional wrestler CM Punk has a tattoo of a three eyed koi fish in honor of Blinky.

In \" Lisa Gets an \"A\" \" Homer pours a large amount of salt in their tank for his lobster Pinchy , almost killing them, much to Lisa's chagrin. In \" I, D'oh-Bot \", Snowball III drowns in their tank while attempting to eat them.

{"question": "What is the art of hand-making cricket bats called?", "answers": ["cricket bats", "cricket bat"], "context": "Cricket bat willow and the cricket bat making processCricket bat willow and the cricket bat making process \n Here you can see a trunk that Jeremy \n said would supply Grade 1 bat willow.   \n If you look closely at the trunk you can \n clearly see the grains of this willow         tree \n (This tree will produce cricket bats with  \n around 9 or 10 grains.) \n   \n The 28 inch length trunks are then cut into what are called clefts which is         a large cricket bat shaped piece willow ready to be shaped into a bat proper. Prior to          shaping however this ï¿½greenï¿½ cleft of willow has its         ends dipped in wax and is then air dried for up to a period of one year. Some         cricket bat          manufacturers will have these clefts kiln dried to speed         up cricket bat production but all master Pod Crafters will only allow their         willow to be naturally air dried. \n Once turned into raw clefts a most important stage of the cricket bat making process         takes place when Jeremy Ruggles selects and grades the willow into four         or so main categories. Cricket bat manufacturers and pod crafters across the world will buy their         clefts under these four main categories so willow grade selection is a         very important process. And despite modern day advances there is still only one way to grade willow         and that is to inspect it manually by hand and eye. So your cricket bat (if made from English Willow) effectively has         a 90% chance of having gone through this very process by hand at J.S.         Wright & Sons. \n In this photo you can see Jeremy specially grading a selection of the finest Grade1 willow for Middlepeg         and Laver & Wood.  For us at Middlepeg to see first hand the absolute best willow being chosen          was most inspiring ï¿½ it certainly is a long way going through our dads old timber piles as kids many         years ago looking for anything suitable to make a bat! \n Willow is graded by a number of points but most importantly the quality relates         to the straightness of the grain, the width of the grain (see below) and         the appearance of any blemishes in the willow which does not necessarily         detract from the performance of the willow (and can in fact sometimes         make it a better cricket bat). \n Narrow Grain or Wide Grain? \n One of the most popular talking points with cricket bats is the amount of grains         that a good bat should have. The ï¿½grainsï¿½ of a cricket bat are those natural wood lines running up and down a         bat that represent one year of growth for that particular willow tree. \n To make a general statement that Jeremy Ruggles supports himself (along         with a multitude of master cricket bat makers), a good cricket bat should and could have         anywhere between 6 and 12 grains of willow across the face of the bat. \n Years ago and even today there was the belief that a good cricket bat should have as         many grains as possible but this is simply a fallacy and in fact such a         bat though it may play well early, will often not last very long at all. A narrow grain          therefore may feel good early but do not expect too much life out of it. \n A classic example of this and quite coincidently at the time, a well known         international cricketer (we were kindly asked not to identify         this Test player) came in to see Jeremy for a few clefts of willow to         use in an upcoming Test match. The piece that this cricketer chose had about 22 grains in it and had the         red patch of ï¿½heartwoodï¿½ (centre of willow tree) running straight         through the middle of the cleft. \n You can see here Jeremy holding that exact cleft of willow chosen by this cricketer.          The most important point to note hear though was the advice Jeremy         gave to him that such a piece whilst being a ï¿½belterï¿½ would only last 200 runs         at the very most before it would split         and break up.  Humorously         this cricketer said that would be fine and that he would be very happy to get", "parametric_answer": "batmaking", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

He was an unwanted child of a German missionary and a Chinese girl. He became the treasurer for the Tongs, a powerful criminal group at the time and stole $10 million in gold from them, escaping to America. Dr. No was a scientist who specialized in atomic energy. His expertise came at a great cost however, as he lost both of his hands in an accident. They were replaced with powerful mechanical black steel hands. \n Dr. No offered his services to the west but they promptly refused. He seeked revenge and joined the criminal organization SPECTRE, where he planned to sabotage the American missile launch program using a powerful radio beam on his private island Crab Key. \n He bought Crab Key and built an underground lair, which he had designed himself. From the outside, the island had nothing but an old Bauxite mine and a few guards on it, but underground Dr. No had a nuclear reactor that powered his powerful radio beam. His plan was to use the radio beam to override the rockets guidance systems, so he could destroy them on launch. The lair also contained a magnificent $1 Million aquarium. \n Dr. No killed many people who had tried to interfere with his work. The head of section in Jamaica John Strangways and his secretary were killed by Dr. No's henchmen Professor Dent and the \"Three Blind Men\" when he took some radioactive samples from Crab Key. Bond came to investigate and sailed over to the island with Quarrel who was later burned to death by the flame-thrower of Dr. No's  diesel dragon. \n Dr. No had previously attempted to have Bond killed at least three times and when he came to the island Dr. No let him live, hoping that he may join SPECTRE. He realized Bond was just a \"foolish policeman\" and locked him in a cell. Bond escaped just as Dr. No was preparing to destroy another missile. He came into the control room dressed as one of the men and turned the nuclear reactor up to full power, overloading it and ruining Dr. No's plans. \n While everyone evacuated the building, Dr. No ran after Bond and they fought, falling into a lift above the radioactive water pool. Bond managed to climb up the frame of the lift to safety. Due to his steel hands, Dr. No couldn't grip the metal frame and he slowly descended to his death in the radioactive water. Bond escaped just before the entire island blew to pieces because of the reactor overload. \n The Character in the Book \n In Ian Fleming's novel Dr. No, published in 1958, Dr. No is the main villain of the story. He was born in Peking (now Beijing), China to a German father and a Chinese mother. His mothers Aunt was payed to bring Dr. No up, and he has despised his father ever since for abandoning him. He later left home and went to work in Shanghai where he first got involved with the Tongs. \n He started committing many crimes such as murder and arson and enjoyed it thoroughly. He became wanted by either the police or another gang, but was too valuable to the Tong's so they smuggled him into New York, USA where he joined the Hip Sings, a New York based Tongs gang. By the time he was thirty, he became the equivalent of the treasurer. In the 1920's, there was a big war between different gangs and Dr. No joined in with the torture and murder. \n He got a tip that someone was going to attack the Hip Sings, so he stole $1 million in gold from the treasury. He was found by the rest of his gang and tortured, but he wouldn't give in and never told them where the gold was.

It does less well in rich heavy soils or poor ones[11, 63]. Does well in a loamy soil[11]. Very suitable for an alkaline soil[11], but it dislikes very acid soils[17]. Plants are fairly wind tolerant[1, 11]. A very hardy plant but the male flowers can be damaged by heavy frosts at flowering time[200]. The filbert is often cultivated for its edible seeds[50], there are many named varieties[63]. It has often been hybridized with C. avellana in breeding programmes[11]. Plants are self-fertile but a more certain crop is obtained if more than one cultivar is grown[200]. The main difference between cob nuts and filberts is that the husk of a filbert is longer than the seed and often completely encloses it, whilst the husk on a cob nut is shorter than the seed[200]. Squirrels are a major pest of this plant, often decimating the crop of nuts[200]. Members of this genus bear transplanting well and can be easily moved even when relatively large[11]. \n Propagation \n Seed - best sown as soon as it is harvested in autumn in a cold frame[164]. Germinates in late winter or spring. Stored seed should be pre-soaked in warm water for 48 hours and then given 2 weeks warm followed by 3 - 4 months cold stratification[164].

(eêroeis) \n Erinyes, Apulian red-figure krater C4th B.C., Badische Landesmuseum \n THE ERINYES (Furies) were three goddesses of vengeance and retribution who punished men for crimes against the natural order. They were particularly concerned with homicide, unfilial conduct, offenses against the gods, and perjury. A victim seeking justice could call down the curse of the Erinys upon the criminal. The most powerful of these was the curse of the parent upon the child--for the Erinyes were born of just such a crime, being sprung from the blood of Ouranos (Uranus) , when he was castrated by his son Kronos (Cronus) . \n The wrath of the Erinyes manifested itself in a number of ways. The most severe of these was the tormenting madness inflicted upon a patricide or matricide. Murderers might suffer illness or disease; and a nation harbouring such a criminal, could suffer dearth, and with it hunger and disease. The wrath of the Erinyes could only be placated with the rite ritual purification and the completion of some task assigned for atonement. \n The goddesses were also servants of Haides and Persephone in the underworld where they oversaw the torture of criminals consigned  to the Dungeons of the Damned. \n The Erinyes were similar to if not the same as the Poinai (Poenae) (Retaliations), Arai (Arae) (Curses), Praxidikai (Praxidicae) (Exacters of Justice) and Maniai (Maniae) (Madnesses). \n They were depicted as ugly, winged women with hair, arms and waists entwined with poisonous serpents. The sisters wielded whips and were clothed either in the long black robes of mourners, or the short-length skirts and boots of huntress- maidens. \n FAMILY OF THE ERINYES \n [1.1] GAIA by the blood of OURANOS (Hesiod Theogony 176, Bacchylides Frag 52) \n [2.1] NYX (Aeschyluls Eumenides 321, Lycophron 432, Virgil Aeneid 6.250, Ovid Metamorphoses 4.453) \n [3.1] HAIDES & PERSEPHONE (Orphic Hymns 29 & 70) \n [3.2] HAIDES (Statius Thebaid 12.557 & 11.47) \n [4.1] POINE (Valerius Flaccus 1.730", "parametric_answer": "vengeance", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

The game can get quite nerve-racking for the children at this point, and they often run through as fast as they can. The child caught in the middle at the last word of the rhyme is out. \n The captured child secretly chooses to be Oranges or Lemons, and then moves around to stand behind that child forming the arch. When all the children have been captured, the teams have a tug of war. The winning team is the one left standing, but usually none of the children are by the end. \n Where Are These Famous Bells? \n Research shows that these are the churches associated with the rhyme: \n Bells of St Clements \n St Clements, Eastcheap, is a small church, only 64 feet long and 40 feet wide, and stands huddled between two office blocks. There has been a church on the site since the 11th Century; the present one is the third to be standing on the site. The original church was demolished in the 15th Century, and the second was destroyed during the Great Fire of London in 1666. It was rebuilt by Sir Christopher Wren in 1687. \n The church stands in St Clements Lane, in fact, the name of the street comes from the church. It was previously known as Eastcheap. The rhyme begins with this church because when the Thames was wider than it is today, the wharf where the citrus fruit cargoes from the Mediterranean were delivered lay just across the street. It is said the church bells pealed when a cargo arrived. \n Bells of St Martins \n St Martin Orgar church, near Cannon Street, lost its congregation to St Clements church after the body of the church was destroyed in the Great Fire. In 1670 the parish was officially united with the parish of St Clements Eastcheap. The bell tower and part of the nave survived, and the church was rebuilt and used by French Protestants (Hugenots) until 1820, when all but the tower was pulled down. This was rebuilt in 1851 as a rectory for St Clements, and the old bell was rehung as a clock bell in a projecting clock. Now used as offices, it is in Martin Lane, a street that was once notorious for moneylenders. \n Bells of Old Bailey \n St Sepulchre-without-Newgate is the largest church in the city of London. Built around 1450, it was badly damaged in the Great Fire and was rebuilt by Sir Christopher Wren in 1670-1. The historic tower holds the 12 bells of Old Bailey that were restored in 1985.

Contestants answer general knowledge questions to win counters which they use on a large coin pusher arcade-style machine. Only the winner at the end takes home their accumulated money—the rest go home with nothing. \n On 18 June 2015, Tipping Point was renewed until 2017.  \n Format \n Contestants answer questions to win counters to drop into the coin pusher machine. Counters are worth £50 each, and the contestant can drop them into their choice of four drop zones, hoping to push piles of other counters off a pair of shelves. The upper shelf moves back and forth over the lower one. The more coins that are subsequently pushed onto a lower red zone (referred to by Shephard as the \"win zone\"), the more he or she collects and the greater the eventual prize fund. The contestant who accumulates the least amount of money in each round is eliminated until only one contestant remains to play for a jackpot of £10,000. If any counters enter the win zone when not in play (excluding the final round), they are removed from the machine (referred to as an \"ambient drop\"). \n Additional \"mystery counters\" were added in series 2, coloured black and bearing a question mark. Three are present in the machine—two on the upper shelf, and one on the lower—at the start of the game. If any of these counters enter the win zone, the contestant in control of the machine wins a mystery prize (e.g., cases of wine, short holidays, etc.). Two counters marked \"×2\" were added in series 5, which double the value of the counters that drop into the win zone. Rather than being removed from the machine, If any of these special counters enter the win zone when not in play they are put back into the machine. \n A \"ghost drop\" occurs when the counter placed into the machine slides close enough to the guide that the sliding action wrings the air out from between the counter and guide causing it to stick and stop moving for a very short period of time. As the drop time is critical to the game, a ghost drop can adversely affect the luck and skill of the player. While the contestant aims to get the inserted counter down and flat onto the top shelf (where it will push the other counters further towards the shelf edge), a miss-timed drop or one affected by a ghost drop may land in such a way as it ends up 'riding' on top of a counter already on the shelf. Such a rider rarely pushes any of the counters very far at all such that none drop into the win zone. \n Round 1 \n In Round 1, the four contestants are each given three counters. Questions are then asked and the first to sound their buzzer may answer. In the event of an incorrect answer, one of the contestant's counters goes into a penalty pot. If the contestant answers correctly, they must choose either to play one of their own counters if they feel the machine will pay out or, if they feel the machine won't, may instead nominate an opponent, forcing them to use one of their own counters. In either case, the relevant contestant chooses which of the four drop zones they want to drop a counter down and then presses their buzzer to release the counter into the machine.  \n At the end of the round, all the counters in the penalty pot are put up for grabs on a final question. If any contestants are tied for last place or all contestants are tied for the lead, a sudden death question is asked, with no counters at stake. If a contestant answers correctly, they move on to the next round, but if they answer incorrectly, they are eliminated. \n Round 2 \n In Round 2, whoever is in the lead of the three remaining contestants (or if there is a tie, whoever was first to give a correct answer) decides", "parametric_answer": "deal or no deal", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

Did Shakespeare Invent the Name 'Jessica'? \n What's in a name? Lots of history when it comes to Jessica. \n By LaToya Monah \n   \n Claim: The popular name \"Jessica\" was created by playwright William Shakespeare \n It's True. Only 418 years old, \"Jessica,\" as it's currently spelled, was first found in William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice where Jessica is the name of Shylock's daughter. The name is an anglicization of the biblical Hebrew name \"Iskah,\" which was rendered \"Jeska\" in English Bibles at the time. Jessica was the top name of baby girls during the 1980s and 1990s, reigning supreme as the #1 U.S. girl's name from 1985 to 1990 and from 1992 to 1995. Shakespeare isn't only responsible for the name's popularity. \n The poet has coined over 100 now-popular words and phrases spoken today including \n \"Vanish into thin air\" — Othello \n \"Gloomy\" — Titus Andronicus \n \"Bated breath\" — The Merchant of Venice \n \"Zany\" — Love's Labour's Lost \n \"Kill with kindness\" — The Taming of the Shrew \n \"Frugal\" — Much Ado About Nothing \n \"Set my teeth on edge\" — Henry IV, Part I \n \"Fashionable\" — Troiuls and Cressida \n \"Puking\" — As You Like It \n \"Dead as a doornail\" — Henry VI, Part II  William ShakespeareWilliam Shakespeare (;  26 April 1564 (baptised) – 23 April 1616) was an English :poet, :playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.; ; . He is often called England's national poet, and the \"Bard of Avon\".  His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.  \n Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613, at age 49, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, which has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, and religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.  \n Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613.  His early plays were primarily comedies and histories, and these are regarded as some of the best work ever produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, considered some of the finest works in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other playwrights. \n Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. In 1623, however, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two friends and fellow actors of Shakespeare, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare's. It was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Shakespeare is hailed, presciently, as \"not of an age, but for all time\".The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Sixteenth", "parametric_answer": "taming of shrew", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

{"question": "Which country was formerly known by the Greeks as Tylos?", "answers": ["bahrain"], "context": "TylosTylos was the name used by the Greeks to refer to Bahrain, as the centre of pearl trading, when Nearchus came to discover it serving under Alexander the Great.  From the 6th to 3rd century BC Bahrain was included in the Persian Empire by the Achaemenids, an Iranian dynasty.  The Greek admiral Nearchus is believed to have been the first of Alexander's commanders to visit the island, and he found a verdant land that was part of a wide trading network; he recorded: “That in the island of Tylos, situated in the Persian Gulf, are large plantations of cotton tree, from which are manufactured clothes called sindones, a very different degrees of value, some being costly, others less expensive. The use of these is not confined to India, but extends to Arabia.”  The Greek historian, Theophrastus, states that much of the islands were covered in these cotton trees and that Tylos was famous for exporting walking canes engraved with emblems that were customarily carried in Babylon.  Ares was also worshipped by the country's indigenous and Greek population.  \n It is not known whether Bahrain was part of the Seleucid Empire, although the archaeological site at Qalat Al Bahrain has been proposed as a Seleucid base in the Persian Gulf.   Alexander had planned to settle the eastern shores of the Persian Gulf with Greek colonists, and although it is not clear that this happened on the scale he envisaged, Tylos was very much part of the Hellenised world: the language of the upper classes was Greek (although Aramaic was in everyday use), while Zeus was worshipped in the form of the Arabian sun-god Shams.  Tylos even became the site of Greek athletic contests.  \n The name Tylos is thought to be a Hellenisation of the Semitic Tilmun (from Dilmun).  The term Tylos was commonly used for the islands until Ptolemy’s Geographia when the inhabitants are referred to as 'Thilouanoi'.  Some place names in Bahrain go back to the Tylos era, for instance, the residential suburb of Arad in Muharraq, is believed to originate from \"Arados\", the ancient Greek name for Muharraq island.  \n The Greek historian Strabo believed that the Phoenicians originated from Bahrain.  Herodotus also believed that the homeland of the Phoenicians was Bahrain.   This theory was accepted by the 19th-century German classicist Arnold Heeren who said that: \"In the Greek geographers, for instance, we read of two islands, named Tyrus or Tylos, and Arad, Bahrain, which boasted that they were the mother country of the Phoenicians, and exhibited relics of Phoenician temples.\"  The people of Tyre in particular have long maintained Persian Gulf origins, and the similarity in the words \"Tylos\" and \"Tyre\" has been commented upon.  However, there is little evidence of occupation at all in Bahrain during the time when such migration had supposedly taken place.  \n Herodotus's account (written c. 440 BC) refers to the Phoenicians originating from Bahrain. (History, I:1).  \n With the waning of Seleucid Greek power, Tylos was incorporated into Characene or Mesenian, the state founded in what today is Kuwait by Hyspaosines in 127BC. A building inscription found in Bahrain indicates that Hyspoasines occupied the islands, (and it also mention his wife, Thalassia). From the third century BC to the arrival of Islam in the seventh century AD, Bahrain was controlled by two other Iranian dynasties; the Parthians and Sassanids. \n By about 250 BC, the Seleucids lost their territories to Parthians, an Iranian tribe from Central Asia. The Parthian dynasty brought the Persian Gulf under their control and extended their influence as far as Oman. Because they needed to control the Persian Gulf trade route, the Parthians established garrisons in the southern coast of the Persian Gulf.  \n In the third century AD, the Sassanids succeeded the Parthians and held the area until the rise of Islam, four centuries later. Ardashir, the first ruler of the Sassanian dynasty marched forward to Oman and Bahrain and defeat Sanatruq  (or Satiran), probably the Parthian governor of Bahrain.

President of ArgentinaThe President of the Argentine Nation (), usually known as the President of Argentina, is the head of state of Argentina. Under the national Constitution, the President is also the chief executive of the federal government and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. \n Through Argentine history, the office of the Head of State has undergone many changes, both in its title as in its features and powers. Current President Mauricio Macri was sworn into office on 10 December 2015.  \n Features of the office \n Requirements \n Section 90 of the Argentine Constitution establishes the requirements for becoming President. The President must be a natural-born citizen of the country, or have been born to an Argentine citizen if born abroad. The President must also be at least 30 years old. In addition, all the requirements for becoming a Senator apply. \n Sections 94 to 98 detail the electoral requirements. A two-round system is used (Section 94). In order to win the election in the first round, the winning candidate's party must receive either more than 45 percent of so-called \"votos positivos\" (Section 97) or at least 40 percent of \"votos positivos\" and be more than 10 percentage points ahead of the next most-voted candidate (Section 98). \"Votos positivos\" (positive votes) are the votes validly cast for any of the candidates, leaving out of the count blank and spoilt votes. \n If no candidate obtains the necessary votes to win in the first round, then the two candidates with the most votes compete in the second round, held two weeks later, when the candidate with the most votes in that round is elected president. \n Term duration \n Under the 1994 constitutional amendment, the President serves for four years, with a possibility of immediate reelection for one more term. However, unlike the President of the United States, in Argentina a person may be reelected again after serving for two terms, and staying out of office for the following term. So after serving for two consecutive periods, the president is not allowed to run for a third consecutive one, but may return for the two following elections and so on. There is no limit for a person to be a candidate if he or she does not win the elections. \n Also, a person being vice-president for two consecutive periods, or president and then vice-president, or vice-president and then president, is under the same restrictions mentioned above. \n Under the constitution of 1853, the President served for six years, with no possibility of consecutive reelection. In 1949, reelection for an indefinite number of terms was allowed (and disabled in 1957). After the 1966 military coup, the rulers promulgated a law establishing terms of four years, terms which were never completed because of political instability. \n In addition with the 1994 constitutional reform,", "parametric_answer": "venezuela", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

His reign was one of several reforms: the poor law updated,  municipal \n government  democratised, child labour restricted and slavery abolished throughout  the British Empire. The most important reform legislation of William IV's  reign was the Reform Act 1832, which refashioned the British electoral  system.

{"question": "What is the name of the fictional club in the James Bond novel ‘Moonraker’?", "answers": ["blades club"], "context": "Moonraker (novel)Moonraker is the third novel by the British author Ian Fleming to feature his fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond. It was published by Jonathan Cape on 5 April 1955 and featured a cover design conceived by Fleming. The plot is derived from a Fleming screenplay that was too short for a full novel so he added the bridge passage between Bond and the industrialist Hugo Drax. In the latter half of the novel, the premise of Bond seconded to Drax's staff as the businessman builds the Moonraker, a prototype missile designed to defend England. Unknown to Bond, Drax is German, an ex-Nazi now working for the Soviets; his plan is to build the rocket, arm it with a nuclear warhead, and fire it at London. Uniquely for a Bond novel, Moonraker is set entirely in Britain, which raised comments from some readers, complaining about the lack of exotic locations. \n Moonraker, like Fleming's previous novels, was well received by critics. Moonraker plays on a number of 1950s fears, including attack by rockets (following the V-2 strikes of the Second World War), Soviet communism, the re-emergence of Nazism and the \"threat from within\" posed by both ideologies. Fleming examines Englishness, and the novel shows the virtues and strength of England. Adaptations include a broadcast on South African radio in 1956 starring Bob Holness and a 1958 Daily Express comic strip. The novel's name was used in 1979 for the eleventh official film in the Eon Productions Bond series and the fourth to star Roger Moore as Bond; the plot was significantly changed from the novel to include excursions into space. \n Plot \n The British Secret Service agent James Bond is asked by his superior, M, to join him at M's club, Blades. A club member, the multi-millionaire businessman Sir Hugo Drax, is winning considerable money playing bridge, seemingly against the odds. M suspects Drax is cheating, and while claiming indifference, is concerned as to why a multi-millionaire and national hero would cheat. Bond confirms Drax's deception and manages to turn the tables—aided by a pack of stacked cards—and wins £15,000. \n Drax is the product of a mysterious background, purportedly unknown even to himself. Presumed to have been a British Army soldier during the Second World War, he was badly injured and stricken with amnesia in the explosion of a bomb planted by a German saboteur at a British field headquarters. After extensive rehabilitation in an army hospital, he returned home to become a wealthy industrialist. After building his fortune and establishing himself in business and society, Drax started building the \"Moonraker\", Britain's first nuclear missile project, intended to defend Britain against its Cold War enemies. The Moonraker rocket was to be an upgraded V-2 rocket using liquid hydrogen and fluorine as propellants; to withstand the ultra-high combustion temperatures of its engine, it used columbite, in which Drax had a monopoly. Because the rocket's engine could withstand high heat, the Moonraker was able to use these powerful fuels, greatly expanding its effective range. \n After a Ministry of Supply security officer working at the project is shot dead, M assigns Bond to replace him and also to investigate what has been going on at the missile-building base, located between Dover and Deal on the south coast of England. All the rocket scientists working on the project are German. At his post on the complex, Bond meets Gala Brand, a beautiful police Special Branch officer working undercover as Drax's personal assistant. Bond also uncovers clues concerning his predecessor's death, concluding that the man may have been killed for witnessing a submarine off the coast. \n Drax's henchman Krebs is caught by Bond snooping through his room. Later, an attempted assassination by triggering a landslide nearly kills Bond and Brand, as they swim beneath the Dover cliffs. Drax takes Brand to London, where she discovers the truth about the Moonraker by comparing her own launch trajectory figures with those in a notebook picked from Drax's pocket.

They consist of two main islands, East Falkland and West Falkland , together with about 700 smaller islands. Stanley , on East Falkland, is the capital and largest city. The islands are a self-governing Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom , but have been the subject of a claim to sovereignty by Argentina since the early years of Argentina's independence from Spain. \n In 1982 the islands were invaded by Argentina, precipitating the two-month-long undeclared Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom, which resulted in the defeat and withdrawal of Argentine forces. Since the war there has been strong economic growth in both fisheries and tourism. The inhabitants of the islands, who are of mainly Scottish descent, are British citizens, and support British sovereignty. \n Contents \n [ edit ] Name \n The islands are referred to in the English language as \"[The] Falkland Islands\". This name dates from an expedition led by John Strong in 1690 , who named the islands after his patron, Anthony Cary, 5th Viscount Falkland . The Spanish name for the islands, \"Islas Malvinas\", is derived from the French name \"Îles Malouines\", bestowed in 1764 by Louis Antoine de Bougainville , after the mariners and fishermen from the Breton port of Saint-Malo who became the island's first known human settlers. \n The Falkland Islanders, as well as many others, tend to consider as offensive the use of the name Malvinas, as for them it has an association with Argentina's military invasion of the islands in 1982 . Some English-language media sources use the ISO designation of \"Falkland Islands (Malvinas)\". \n Main article: History of the Falkland Islands \n The Falkland Islands have had a complex history since their discovery, with France , Britain , Spain and Argentina all claiming possession and establishing as well as abandoning settlements on the islands. The Spanish government's claim was continued by Argentina after the latter's independence in 1816 and the independence war in 1817 , until 1833 when the United Kingdom took by force control of the islands, following the destruction of the Argentine settlement at Puerto Soledad by the American sloop USS Lexington ( December 28 , 1831 ). Argentina has continued to claim sovereignty over the islands, and the dispute was used by the military junta dictatorship as an excuse to invade and briefly occupy the islands before being defeated in the two-month-long undeclared Falklands War in 1982 by a United Kingdom task force which returned the islands to British control. \n The islands were uninhabited when they were first discovered by European explorers. There is disputed evidence of prior settlement by humans, based on the existence of the Falkland Island fox , or Warrah, on the islands, as well as a scattering of undated artifacts including arrowheads and the remains of a canoe. It is thought this canid was brought to the island by humans, although it may have reached the islands by itself via a land bridge during the last ice age . \n The first European explorer widely credited with sighting the islands is Sebald de Weert , a Dutch sailor, in 1600 .

Throughout the first decade of his daughters' lives the family has lived in two cities, Chicago and Washington, D.C. By the time he was 10, Obama had lived in two countries. \n While Obama has put down the strongest of roots, his mother opted for wings, never staying in one place, let alone one country, for long. \n \"I never imagined that an American president would have a mother who had done the things that she did,\" Janny Scott, who wrote a biography of Obama's mother, told The New York Times. \n And in her biography, \"A Singular Woman,\" Scott quoted the president. His mother had given him, he said, \"a sense of unconditional love that was big enough that, with all the surface disturbances of our lives, it sustained me, entirely.\" \n Here are five facts that make President Obama's mother no ordinary mom. \n 1. \n She lived in five states and three countries \n Ann Dunham's family moved five times before Ann, or Stanley, as she was called in her childhood, turned 18, bouncing from Wichita, Kans., to California to Texas to Seattle and, finally, to Hawaii. \n As an adult Dunham adopted her parents' knack for nomadism, splitting most of her adult life between Hawaii and Indonesia, and briefly taking up residence in Pakistan, where she helped establish a microfinance program for women. \n Her son, on the other hand, took the opposite approach, putting down roots in Chicago and firmly planting himself and his family in the U.S. \n \"We've created stability for our kids in a way that my mom didn't do for us,\" Obama told Time magazine during his 2008 presidential campaign. \"My choosing to put down roots in Chicago and marry a woman who is very rooted in one place probably indicates a desire for stability that maybe I was missing.\" \n 2. \n Her first name is actually Stanley \n President Obama's mother's full name is Stanley Ann Dunham. Although she used her middle name for the majority of her adult life, Dunham went by Stanley throughout grade school, the name that her father, who wanted a son, gave her. \n Over the course of Dunham's short life -- she died when she was in her early 50s -- she went by four different names . Growing up it was Stanley Dunham. In college she was Ann Dunham. During her first marriage, to Barack Obama's father, she was Ann Obama. And after her second marriage she was Ann Soetoro. \n 3. \n She was 18 when Barack Obama was born \n President Obama's mother married his father at the ripe young age of 18, after the two met in a Russian-language class at the University of Hawaii. At the time, interracial marriage was illegal in most states. \n Dunham was three months pregnant when the two tied the knot in a ceremony so discrete that her son never uncovered any records of the event, according to Scott's biography of Dunham, \"A Singular Woman.\" \n By the time Obama was a year old, his father, Barack Obama Sr., had moved from Hawaii to Massachusetts to get a masters degree from Harvard.

It has approximately a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 16.\" \n What proportion of children have MDI scores of at least 120? \n AREAS UNDER THE NORMAL CURVE: \n Before answering this question lets review briefly areas under the normal distribution. \n Area between one and minus one standard deviation. \n As we saw several times before, the area between  1.0 standard deviation is about 67%. Since the total area equals 1.0, the area above and below 1 standard deviation is 100% - 67%  34% (or in proportions 1.0 - .67  .34.) \n See the figure in previous notes \n Area between  2 standard deviations is about 95%, again as seen before. \n Area between  1.96 standard deviations. \n As seen in Figure 1 below the area between -1.96 and +1.96 standard deviations is 47.5% + 47.5%  95 percent. \n That means that about 5% of the area lies below -1.96 and +1.96 standard deviations. \n Finally, the proportion of the area under the curve between  2.56 standard deviations of the mean is .99, as we have seen before and below in Figure 2. \n It's natural to ask how one \"finds\" the area under a normal curve. \n Note that although there a curve for every choice of and , they share common properties such as shape. \n Hence, if one knows the areas for one normal distributions, it's easy to find the corresponding areas in another. \n All that is necessary is to convert from one scale to another. \n The standard normal distribution. \n The areas under the curve of a normal distribution having mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1 has been extensively tabulated. \n Instead of calling the variable scale Y it is labeled z. So the standard normal distribution shows how values of z are related to f(z) and one can determine the area between any two points along the z scale by referring to a table. \n Computer programs (e.g., SPSS and MINITAB) compute the values directly, but we will use the table for most of our work. \n Moreover we can convert any Y score to a z score, which means that we can find areas between any two points Y1 and Y2 by converting them to z1 and z2 and looking in the table of the standard normal. \n STANDARDIZED OR Z SCORES: \n To use the standard normal distribution we have to change raw data to \"standardized\" data. \n Remember the standard normal distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.0, but we usually deal with different measurement scales where, for example, the mean might be 500 and the standard deviation 25. Thus, we wouldn't know from the table how much of the area is in the interval from, say, 463 to 589. \n But we can find out by changing raw data to \"standardized\" or z scores. \n To convert the data follow these steps: \n Find the mean, \n of Y, the variable of interest. \n To convert a particular raw score to a standard or z-score use the formula: \n z is called a standard value, a standardized value or a z score. They are all the same. z is obtained from the original data by subtracting the mean of the original data and dividing by the standard deviation. \n Examples: \n Suppose we have a batch of data with a mean of 90 and a standard deviation of 10. What is the z score corresponding to a raw score of 100? \n Suppose now the data are such that the mean is 1053.72 and \n is 105.69.

The triangles alternate in color and are grouped into four quadrants of six triangles each. The quadrants are referred to as a player's home board and outer board, and the opponent's home board and outer board. The home and outer boards are separated from each other by a ridge down the center of the board called the bar . \n Figure 1.  A board with the checkers in their initial position. \n An alternate arrangement is the reverse of the one shown here, with the home board on the left and the outer board on the right. \n The points are numbered for either player starting in that player's home board. The outermost point is the twenty-four point, which is also the opponent's one point. Each player has fifteen checkers of his own color. The initial arrangement of checkers is: two on each player's twenty-four point, five on each player's thirteen point, three on each player's eight point, and five on each player's six point. \n Both players have their own pair of dice and a dice cup used for shaking. A doubling cube , with the numerals 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 on its faces, is used to keep track of the current stake of the game. \n Object of the Game \n The object of the game is move all your checkers into your own home board and then bear them off. The first player to bear off all of their checkers wins the game. \n Figure 2.  Direction of movement of White's checkers. Red's checkers move in the opposite direction. \n Movement of the Checkers \n To start the game, each player throws a single die. This determines both the player to go first and the numbers to be played. If equal numbers come up, then both players roll again until they roll different numbers. The player throwing the higher number now moves his checkers according to the numbers showing on both dice. After the first roll, the players throw two dice and alternate turns. \n The roll of the dice indicates how many points, or pips , the player is to move his checkers. The checkers are always moved forward, to a lower-numbered point. The following rules apply: \n A checker may be moved only to an open point , one that is not occupied by two or more opposing checkers. \n The numbers on the two dice constitute separate moves. For example, if a player rolls 5 and 3, he may move one checker five spaces to an open point and another checker three spaces to an open point, or he may move the one checker a total of eight spaces to an open point, but only if the intermediate point (either three or five spaces from the starting point) is also open. \n Figure 3.  Two ways that White can play a roll of  \n   \n . \n A player who rolls doubles plays the numbers shown on the dice twice. A roll of 6 and 6 means that the player has four sixes to use, and he may move any combination of checkers he feels appropriate to complete this requirement. \n A player must use both numbers of a roll if this is legally possible (or all four numbers of a double). When only one number can be played, the player must play that number. Or if either number can be played but not both, the player must play the larger one. When neither number can be used, the player loses his turn. In the case of doubles, when all four numbers cannot be played, the player must play as many numbers as he can. \n Hitting and Entering \n A point occupied by a single checker of either color is called a blot .

{"question": "On a standard dartboard, which number lies between 12 and 20?", "answers": ["five", "5"], "context": "The Dartboard Sequence - MathPagesThe Dartboard Sequence \n The Dartboard Sequence \n The arrangement of the numbers around the circumference of a standard  dart board is as shown below         20 1 18 4 13 6 10 15 2 17 3 19 7 16 8 11 14 9 12 5   Oddly enough, no one seems to know for sure how this particular arrangement was selected.  It evidently dates back at least 100 years.  Some say the  pattern was devised by a carpenter named Brian Gamlin in 1896, while others attribute it to someone named Thomas William Buckle in 1913, but both of  these attributions are relatively recent, and neither can be traced back  to a contemporary source.  Also, although it's clear that the numbers are ordered to mix the large and small together, and possibly to separate numerically close values as far as possible (e.g., 20 is far from 19), no  one seems to know of any simple criterion that uniquely singles out this  particular arrangement as the best possible in any quantitative sense.   It may be just an accident of history that this particular arrangement  has been adopted as the standard dart board format.   It's interesting to consider various possible criteria for choosing a  circular arrangement of the first n positive integers.  In order to get  as \"flat\" a distribution as possible, we might try to minimize the  sum of the squares of each k consecutive terms.  For example, setting  k = 3, the standard dard board sequence gives    (20+1+18)^2 + (1+18+4)^2 + (18+4+13)^2 + ... + (5+20+1)^2  =  20478   Apparently the standard board layout described above is called the \"London\" dart board, and there is another, less common, version called the \"Manchester\" dart board, which has the sequence        20 1 16 6 17 8 12 9 14 5 19 2 15 3 18 7 11 10 13 4  for which the sum of squares of each set of three consecutive numbers is 20454, just slightly less than the London arrangement.  In contrast,  if we were to arrange the numbers by just inter-weaving the largest and  smallest numbers like this          20 1 19 2 18 3 17 4 16 5 15 6 14 7 13 8 12 9 11 10     the resulting sum of squares of each 3 consecutive elements is 20510, so the standard dart boards are, in this sense, more flat distributions.   Needless to say, all of these arrangements are much more flat than the  natural monotonic sequence         1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20   which has a sum of 24350.    By the way, note that if the sum of the squares of every sum of three  consecutive numbers for a given arrangement is S, then we can form another arrangement with the same sum simply by taking the \"21-complement\", i.e.,  subtracting each number from 21. For example, the complement of the  standard London arrangement is        1 20 3 17 8 15 11 6 19 4 18 2 14 5 13 10 7 12 9 16  which has the same sum (20478) as the London arrangement. This works because if we begin with an arrangement a,b,c,d,... having the sum     S = (a+b+c)^2 + (b+c+d)^2 + (c+d+e)^2 + ...  and replace each of the numbers a,b,c,... with 21-a, 21-b, 21-c,... respectively, the sum S' of this complementary arrangement is     S' = [(21-a)+(21-b)+(21-c)]^2 + [(21-b)+(21-c)+(21-d)]^2 + ...        = [63-(a+b+c)]^2 + [63-(b+c+d)]^2 + ...        = S + 20(63)^2 - 2(63)[(a+b+c)+(b+c+d)+...]  Each of the numbers from 1 to 20 appears three times in the summation inside the square brackets in the last term, so that summation equals 630, and hence S' = S. (The same identity applies to the N+1 complement for sums of squares of every sum of k consecutive terms of a circular  arrangement of the first", "parametric_answer": "14", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

{"question": "How many double-word score squares are there on a standard Scrabble board?", "answers": ["17"], "context": "ScrabbleScrabble is a word game in which two to four players score points by placing tiles, each bearing a single letter, onto a gameboard which is divided into a 15×15 grid of squares. The tiles must form words which, in crossword fashion, flow left to right in rows or downwards in columns. The words must be defined in a standard dictionary, or present in specified reference works (e.g., the Official Tournament and Club Word List, the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary), which provide a list of officially permissible words. \n The name Scrabble is a trademark of Hasbro, Inc. in the United States and Canada and has been sold by Hasbro's Parker Brothers division since 1999. Prior to 1999, it was sold as a Milton Bradley game. Outside the United States and Canada, Scrabble is a trademark of Mattel. The game is sold in 121 countries and is available in 29 languages; approximately 150 million sets have been sold worldwide and roughly one-third of American and half of British homes have a Scrabble set.   There are around 4,000 Scrabble clubs around the world. \n Game details \n The game is played by two to four players on a square board with a 15×15 grid of cells (individually known as \"squares\"), each of which accommodates a single letter tile. \n In official club and tournament games, play is between two players or, occasionally, between two teams each of which collaborates on a single rack. \n The board is marked with \"premium\" squares, which multiply the number of points awarded: eight dark red \"triple-word\" squares, 17 pink \"double-word\" squares, of which one, the center square (H8), is marked with a star or other symbol; 12 dark blue \"triple-letter\" squares, and 24 light blue \"double-letter\" squares. In 2008, Hasbro changed the colors of the premium squares to orange for TW, red for DW, blue for DL, and green for TL. Despite this, the original premium square color scheme is still the preferred scheme for Scrabble boards used in tournaments.  \n In an English-language set, the game contains 100 tiles, 98 of which are marked with a letter and a point value ranging from 1 to 10. The number of points of each lettered tile is based on the letter's frequency in standard English writing; commonly used letters such as vowels are worth one point, while less common letters score higher, with Q and Z each worth 10 points. The game also has two blank tiles that are unmarked and carry no point value. The blank tiles can be used as substitutes for any letter; once laid on the board, however, the choice is fixed. Other language sets use different letter set distributions with different point values. \n Tiles are usually made of wood or plastic and are 19 x square and 4 mm thick, making them slightly smaller than the squares on the board. Only the rosewood tiles of the deluxe edition varies the width up to 2 mm for different letters.  Travelling versions of the game often have smaller tiles (e.g. 13 x); sometimes they are magnetic to keep them in place. The capital letter is printed in black at the centre of the tile face and the letter's point value printed in a smaller font at the bottom right corner. \n S is the most valuable letter in English-language Scrabble because it easily goes on the ends of words; Alfred Butts included only four instances to avoid a game that was \"too easy\". Q is considered the most problematic letter, as most words with it also contain U; a similar problem occurs in other languages like French, Dutch, Italian and German. J is also difficult to play due to its low frequency and a scarcity of words having it at the end.  C and V may be troublesome in the endgame, since no two-letter words with them exist, save for CH in SOWPODS. \n History \n In 1938, American architect Alfred Mosher Butts created the game as a variation on an earlier word game he invented called Lexiko.

NATOThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO; ; '), also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty which was signed on 4 April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party. NATO's headquarters are located in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, where the Supreme Allied Commander also resides. Belgium is one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe, the newest of which, Albania and Croatia, joined in April 2009. An additional 22 countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programmes. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70 percent of the global total.  Members' defence spending is supposed to amount to 2 percent of GDP. \n NATO was little more than a political association until the Korean War galvanized the organization's member states, and an integrated military structure was built up under the direction of two US supreme commanders.

{"question": "The ‘Mahlabatari Declaration of Faith’ was a statement of core principles laid down by the political leaders of which country in 1974?", "answers": ["south africans", "south african", "south africa"], "context": "Mahlabatini Declaration of FaithThe Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith was a statement of core principles laid down by South African political leaders Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Harry Schwarz on 4 January 1974. It was signed in Mahlabatini, KwaZulu-Natal, hence its name. Its purpose was to provide a blueprint for government of South Africa by consent and racial peace in a multi-racial society, stressing opportunity for all, consultation, the federal concept, and a Bill of Rights. It also first affirmed that political change must take place though non-violent means. It was the first agreement in apartheid South Africa by acknowledged black and white political leaders that subscribed to such principles. Final negotiations, which embodied many of the Declaration's principles, took place between President F.W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela in the early 1990s. \n Background \n On 4 January 1974, Harry Schwarz, Transvaal leader of the official opposition United Party, met and had discussions with Gatsha (later Mangosuthu) Buthelezi, Chief Executive Councillor of the black homeland of KwaZulu. They jointly issued a document, which stated that \"the situation of South Africa in the world scene as well as internal community relations requires,  in our view, an acceptance of certain fundamental concepts for the economic, social and constitutional development of our country\". It was intended for these core concepts to be the foundations for negotiations involving all in South Africa. Both leaders were acting in personal capacities. \n The declaration's purpose was to provide a blueprint for government of South Africa for racial peace in South Africa. On the basis of five principles, the declaration declared a \"faith in a South Africa offering equal opportunities, happiness, security, and peace for all its peoples.\" It called for negotiations involving all peoples, in order to draw up constitutional proposals stressing opportunity for all with a Bill of Rights to safeguard these rights.It suggested that the federal concept was the appropriate framework for such changes to take place. It also first affirmed that political change must take place through non-violent means. The concept of a non-discriminatory society had been outlined in the 'Act of Dedication' of 1973 that Schwarz had written, while Leader of the Opposition in the Transvaal. Schwarz had called for the Transvaal and South Africa to adopt and subscribe to the act. While the United Party Transvaal caucus unanimously adopted the initiative, the National Party refused for it to come to debate. The principles of the act were adopted at the 1973 National United Party Congress.  \n Reaction and aftermath \n The declaration was the first of its kind, in that it laid down the concept of a peaceful solution to South Africa's problems at a time when neither the National Party nor the African National Congress was interested in peaceful solutions or dialogue. The declaration took place during a period when virtually no formal or informal political contact existed between black and white groups. Political figures such as Alan Paton praised the declaration. The agreement was heralded by many as a breakthrough in race relations in South Africa. The declaration drew much media interest both inside and outside South Africa. \n Black reaction \n Shortly after the declaration was issued, several chief ministers of the black homelands, including Cedric Phatudi (Lebowa), Lucas Mangope (Bophuthatswana) and Hudson Nisanwisi (Gazankulu), met in Cape Town. The leaders announced to the press that they fully supported the declaration. \n In February 1974, Prime Minister of Swaziland Makhosini Dlamini praised the declaration as inspiration to South Africans \"across the color line\" and as an example of effectiveness in working for his people within the framework of the law.  \n In March 1974 Chief Phatudi, Harry Schwarz and M. I. Mitchell (United Party MP), had discussions at Sheshego. They issued a joint statement, endorsing the principles embodied in the Mahlabatini Declaration. It also stated that all South Africans must be united to meet any external threats, subversion, or terrorism, and that the best way of uniting the people to meet such threats was to give them a real stake in the society which they were asked to defend.  \n Days after the declaration, Die Vaderland, an ardent Nationalist Afrikaans newspaper, mocked Schwarz and", "parametric_answer": "iran", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

Especially if you've ever heard of Chaucer's famous poem about these two lovebirds, Troilus and Criseyde. Actually, Shakespeare is sort of banking on his audience's knowledge of Chaucer's poem. Back in the day, the love story of Troilus and Cressida was as famous as the story of Romeo and Juliet is for us today. \n We should also tell you that, sometimes, the play is called The History of Troilus and Cressida , or The Tragedy of Troilus and Cressida .

{"question": "What dish, especially popular in parts of Wales and the English Midlands,  is traditionally made from pig's heart, liver and fatty belly meat or bacon minced together, with herbs added for flavouring and sometimes bread crumbs", "answers": ["faggots", "faggot"], "context": "Faggot (food)Faggots are a traditional dish in the UK,   especially South and Mid Wales and the Midlands of England.    It is made from meat off-cuts and offal, especially pork. A faggot is traditionally made from pig's heart, liver and fatty belly meat or bacon minced together, with herbs added for flavouring and sometimes bread crumbs. \n Faggots originated as a traditional cheap food of ordinary country people in Western England, particularly west Wiltshire and the West Midlands.  Their popularity spread from there, especially to South Wales in the mid-nineteenth century, when many agricultural workers left the land to work in the rapidly expanding industry and mines of that area. \n Faggots are also known as \"ducks\" in the Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Lancashire, often as \"Savoury Ducks\". The first use of the term in print was in the Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser of Saturday 3 June 1843, a news report of a gluttonous man who ate twenty of them.  \n The first use in print cited in the Oxford English Dictionary is in 1851, from Henry Mayhew, where he describes a dish identical to the modern product with chopped liver and lights in an outer wrapper of caul.  This was in London. \n Preparation and serving \n Commonly, the faggot consists of minced pork liver and heart, wrapped in bacon, with onion and breadcrumbs. Often, the faggot is cooked in a crock with gravy and served with peas and mashed potato. The mixture is shaped by hand into small balls, wrapped with caul fat (the omentum membrane from the pig's abdomen), and baked. \n Another variation of faggot is Pig's fry wrapped in pig's caul: the pig's fry and boiled onions are minced (ground) together, then mixed with breadcrumbs or cold boiled potatoes, seasoned with sage, mixed herbs and pepper, all beaten together and then wrapped in small pieces of caul to form a ball. They are then baked in the oven and are usually served cold.  \n Production \n The dish gained in popularity during the rationing in World War II, though its popularity has declined in recent years. Faggots are often homemade and are to be found in traditional butchers' shops and market stalls, though larger supermarkets generally stock the Mr Brain's brand of mass-produced faggot. This is a frozen food product available in Britain, made of liver and onions rolled into meatballs and served in a sauce. These differ significantly from traditional faggots, which have a coarser texture and contain far less water. \n A popular dish is faggots and peas. This combination is common in the Black Country area of the West Midlands. It is still common to see small butchers' shops in the area selling faggots cheaply, made to their own recipe. \n Double meaning \n The use of the word \"faggot\" has caused controversy due to its additional meaning  as a pejorative term for a homosexual man in American English. In 2004, a radio commercial for the UK supermarket chain Somerfield, in which an American man rejects his wife's suggested dinner saying \"I've got nothing against faggots, I just don't fancy them\" was found to have breached the Advertising and Sponsorship Code and was banned by the industry regulator Ofcom.  In November 2013, it was reported that British Facebook users had been blocked temporarily for using the word, in its culinary sense, on the website. Facebook said that the word had been \"misinterpreted.\"  Food Dictionary : Cook AdviceFood Dictionary : Cook Advice \n Home › \n Food Dictionary \n a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h | i | j | k | l | m | n | o | p | q | r | s | t | u | v | w | x | y | z \n A la mode \n Served with or in the fashion of.

It is used primarily for football matches, including the home matches of the England national football team and domestic and European club finals. The original stadium, with its distinctive twin towers, first opened to the public on 28 April 1923, and remained in use until 2000, when it was closed with a new stadium to be built on the site. Though the original structure was closed in 2000, it was not demolished until 2003, after which construction began on the new stadium, originally intended to open in 2006. This was later delayed until early 2007. The final completion date of the stadium was 9 March 2007, when the stadium was handed over to the FA. \n Chelsea have played 24 competitive matches at Wembley: nine FA Cup finals, five FA Cup semi-finals, three League Cup finals, two Full Members Cup finals and five Charity/Community Shield matches. Chelsea first played at Wembley in the 1944 War Cup South final against Charlton; the Blues lost 3-1 . Their first Wembley FA Cup final appearance came in 1967, losing 2-1 to Tottenham. Three years later they returned to Wembley for another FA Cup final, this time against Leeds United and again in 1972 for the League Cup final against Stoke City . That proved to be the Blues' last major Wembley cup final appearance for 22 years, though they did play two Full Members Cup finals there in 1986 and 1990. In the former, David Speedie became the first player to score a Wembley hat-trick since Geoff Hurst in the 1966 World Cup final. \n At the fourth attempt, Chelsea finally won an FA Cup final at Wembley by beating Middlesbrough 2-0 in 1997. In 2000, Chelsea won the last FA Cup final held at the old Wembley and seven years later completed a unique achievement by beating Manchester United to win the first FA Cup final held at the new Wembley. Didier Drogba 's winning goal made him the first player to score in an FA Cup final at the new Wembley. Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Čech also became the first goalkeeper not to concede a goal in a competitive game at Wembley. As of 2015, Chelsea have played 13 matches at the new Wembley, a record, and have won more matches at the new stadium than any other club.

News of the formation of the group created a buzz of excitement among the public, and a free concert was scheduled for London’s Hyde Park on June 7, 1969. Their small repertoire was reported by the music press as having disappointed the crowd of 100,000 who were also expecting to hear songs from the days of Cream and Traffic.

{"question": "How many ‘Triangles’ are there on the logo of car manufacturer BMW?", "answers": ["four", "4"], "context": "8 Bits Of Perfect Geometry In Classic Logos – Inspiration Bit8 Bits Of Perfect Geometry In Classic Logos – Inspiration Bit \n 18 commented bits \n Everyone knows about the importance of having the right logo. It’s the first impression we get about the company or the individual. The great logos burn that impression forever into our memory banks. Have you noticed though that the most recognized and eye-pleasing logos are the simple ones. Some logos are just logotypes, others get that distinctive look with the help of intricate or more familiar geometric shapes. \n So if you’re looking for some design inspirations for your logo, it’s time to get back in shape, into geometric shape that is. The simple shapes that are used as the foundation for all other shapes are the square, rectangle, circle, oval or ellipse, and triangle. Each of them comes with a certain meaning that can be used in design appropriately. \n Squares and rectangles are considered to be the most familiar man-made objects that surround us: just think of all those buildings we look at and live in, books, newspapers we read, the screens we stare at. All that helps squares and rectangles to evoke in us the feelings of comfort and safety. In design these shapes are used to suggest stability, knowledge and truth. Squares are often regarded as the most honest and trusted shapes, more so than rectangles. \n Circles indicate completeness, freedom or infinity. They can be used to imply movement or security and protection. Circles and ovals are perfect attention grabbers due to their enclosing nature. Circles are considered to be the most perfect of all forms and are often used to convey the ideal choice. \n Triangles are the most dynamic of all shapes. They can suggest growth, progress, action and movement. Due to their pointy nature triangles are often used in design to indicate a direction, pointing us in the right way. \n All of those shapes can be combined with each other to achieve very interesting and unique designs and deliver an elaborate message. One triangle or a series of them can point to one or more directions. The shapes of one form can be grouped together to make another shape. The shapes can be used to replace letters of the same form, or vice versa, several letters together can form a shape. \n The combinations and designs are limitless, just let your imagination fly. And to inspire you with some valuable ideas, take a look at how some of the well-known companies had their logos designed with geometric shapes. \n 1. Circle \n HBO ‘s logo with a circle inside the ‘O’, simple as it is, still definitely grabs our attention. \n Audi ‘s four rings certainly bear similarities with the Olympic rings, correlating with the idea of four Audi companies coming together as a group – AUDI, DKW, Horch and Wanderer. \n ABC ‘s logo was designed by none other but the Logo Maestro himself – Paul Rand, who modified the old logo which was lowercase ‘abc’ inside a lower case ‘a’, and turned it into the current “abc circle” in 1962 by reducing each letter to its most elemental circular form. \n Ubuntu Linux logo is a perfect example of experimenting with extracting and combining the clones of one shape (circle) with the right blend of  colours. \n MasterCard is another prime example in using interlocking circles, this time only two, with a few horisontal lines in the middle. The logo represents MasterCard Worldwide with its reach for a global audience. \n BMW logo is using the Bavarian national colours of black, white and blue. In 1942 Wilhelm Farrenkopf, the Advertising Manager, has described the logo as the shining disk with the “shades of the engines, two silver divides and bright blue gleams that represent the sky”. \n 2. Oval \n Ford ‘s distinctive oval logo was first introduced in 1907. The oval was designed to promote the company’s “hallmark for reliability and economy”. By 1911 the script lettering was added to represent the company’s name. Since 1976, the blue and silver Ford oval badge, called “Centennial Blue Oval” has", "parametric_answer": "BMW", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

When normal programs finished at the end of every day, pages from Ceefax would carry on scrolling, keeping insomniacs and night workers company through the wee hours. Its cheesy synthesized music is arguably as iconic a sound of its time as the squeal of a dial-up modem was to the 1990s. \n Ceefax was first developed by the BBC as a way to transmit subtitles using unused parts of the broadcast spectrum, but researchers at the broadcaster realised that the same technology could just as easily handle full pages of text. That led to the first test transmissions in 1974, with a formal rollout in 1976. Early television sets needed a special chip to be able to receive and store the information as it was broadcast—many of those reading this will remember waiting for a page to refresh, watching the ticker at the top right which slowly crept upwards as each page was rebroadcast with new information. \n The new system was fast and flexible enough to be used for breaking news, along with other information (like stocks or the weather) where there was a need for regular updates. It was only a one-way system, though, which limited its uses, and as computers with Internet access became more common Ceefax went from a necessity to a curiosity—something you'd use to check the football scores when at a relative's house. \n The beginning of the switchover to entirely digital television broadcasts in the UK signalled the final call for teletext services, which lived on parts of the analog spectrum marked for use for digital services. ITV and Channel 4 closed down their teletexts in December 2009, leaving Ceefax as the lone survivor—but as each region of the country turned from analog to digital, pages from Ceefax continued to live on in the dead time between each days' programming, usually on BBC Two. The final broadcast of those pages went out yesterday, and when Northern Ireland finishes its digital switchover on October 24 Ceefax will be gone. \n You can still get continually updated information from the BBC on the red button, but it really isn't the same. \n Wired's July issue reported on the world's first teletext art competition, held by Finnish art collective FixC—the winning entries were displayed on German teletext services in August. The UK's move away from teletext services is a bit faster than what's happening in continental Europe, where teletext remains more common.

Ceefax, the world's first teletext service, was launched to the public in September 1974 at a time when television sets that used the service were so few and far between that the engineers - who were usually middle-aged bearded men - could send messages to their wives to tell them what time they would be home for tea, and no one would be any the wiser. \n Today, it's quite easy to talk about the blocky graphics and primary colours of teletext in the past tense, as Ceefax was switched off during the switchover to digital television in 2012. However, it's still running in some European countries and its influence can still be felt throughout the internet enabled technology world. \n American viewers are likely to be slightly bamboozled by all this, as US broadcasters had already adopted the Closed Captioning system for TV subtitles, the original", "parametric_answer": "oracle", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

Andrew Lloyd Webber attacked his career with a single-minded vision that produced dramatic spectacles such as Cats (1981), Starlight Express (1984), and Phantom of the Opera (1986). Tim Rice, as a modern Renaissance man, has shown an amazing ability to diversify his interests.

I thought and then the search was on... \n A search of the allmusic webiste will reveal many obscure songs for many stars from the Golden Age Of Hollywood. like from 2008 there an electronic band with one album listed called The Marches who have a song named after the biggest silent film star, Rupolph Valentino. Also a German singer Andre Heller has a 3 volume best of box set covering his career from 1967-1991 has a song called \"Rudolpho Valentino\" too. Plug in any famous name and could reveal a song title. \n This article will stick to the better known songs about movie stars. The list is no particular order just the order the songs were found... \n 1.The Eagles - \"James Dean\" \n This pre-Hotel California song first appeared on The Eagles' 1974 album On The Border It was actually co-written by Don Henley and Glen Frey with the latter's former roommates, Jackson Browne and J.D. Souther. Here's a live version of the song from California Jam a large festival show that attempted to recapture the essence of Woodstock in the summer of 1974. The Eagles are joined by Jackson Browne on the song. \n 2. Bauhaus - \"Bela Lugosi's Dead\" \n This is probably the most famous film star tribute merging the goth sounds of Bauhaus with the visual imagery of pre-colour Hollywood horror. \"Bela Lugosi's Dead\" is arguably Bauhaus' most-recognizable song and one of the few songs that the live version was either the only or the most heard rendition. \n 3. Elton John - \"Candle In The Wind\" \n With the death of Diana Princess Of Wales Elton John reworked this ode to the late Marilyn Monroe as a tribute to The People's Princess. The original and far superior version was a album cut from John's 1973 album, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. The album also features the fantastic ballad, \"I've Seen That Movie Too\" about a love affair gone wrong. \n   \n 4. Madness - \"Michael Caine\" \n Micael Caine appears on Madness' 1986 album, Keep Moving. While there could be debate that this song isn't actually about Michael Caine, but actually depicts a story about the troubles in Northern Ireland, Caine was asked to contribute his voice to the song speaking the line \"My Name Is Michael Caine.\" The video is inspired by Caine's most famous film character, Harry Palmer especially the debut of that character in The Ipcress File. \n 5. The Clash - \"The Right Profile\" \n \"The Right Profile\" is one of the many 5-star cuts from The Clash's best album, London Calling. The titular reference is to the face of Montgomery Clift. In 1956 while travelling to a party at Elizabeth Taylor, Clift crashed his car. It is told that Taylor held his head still while covered in blood saving her close friend's life. His face was permanently disfigured and he could only be photographed with his Right Profile. Check out later films like Judgement At Nuremberg or The Misfits to see how film directors were shackled by this impediment. \n 6. The Fall - \"Cary Grant's Wedding\" \n This is one of The Fall's earliest songs originally appearing on the band's 1980 album, Totale's Turns (It's Now or Never). It has more recently available on singles compilation Totally Wired: The Rough Trade Anthology. The song's more about an event, possibly a wedding. The lyrics reference Buster Keaton as a wedding guest, hallucigens and the slaugherer of innocents. What's in MArk E; Smith's twisted mind back then...only he may know. \n   \n 7.

{"question": "What is the minimum legal age for a female to marry in Kuwait?", "answers": ["15 years"], "context": "Legal Marriage Age in Muslims and World Wide.Legal Marriage Age in Muslims and World Wide. \n Legal Mimimum Marriage Age; Past and Present \n Custom Search \n There is a lot of criticism on marriage age in Islam. Some allege that Muslim marriage law allows marriage of minors. However, Quran indicates at least on one place that there is definite age which can be termed as age of marriage: \n “Make trial of orphans until they reach the age of marriage; if then ye find sound judgment in them, release their property to them; but consume it not wastefully, nor in haste against their growing up.” \n (Quran 4: 6 Abdullah Yusufali) \n The Muslim jurists agree that the ‘age of marriage’ mentioned here is age of puberty. Shafis alone declare that age of 15 years should be taken as age of marriage. Other branches of Islam don’t give any specific age but agree that age of marriage can be different in different regions depending upon the age of puberty. Furthermore, consent of a Muslim marriage partner is not recognized unless she reaches to the age of puberty. \n Recent History \n Different societies have been accepting different levels of age as marriage age in different times. When Quran was revealed the world society was passing through dark ages. Slavery was institution of the day. Women were treated like any other commodity. Islam not only revolted against these social evils but also allowed the women to enter into marriage contract with their free consent. Quran seems the first book ever that talks about age of marriage. \n But marriage age was not a problem till the dawn of 20th century… \n English Common Law had allowed a male at the age of 14 and female at the age of 12 years to marry with consent of their parents. The English Marriage Act of 1753 abolished English Common Law but still permitted previously established marriage age. In 1927, the English legislature raised the marriage age to 16 years for the both sexes. \n The U.S society followed the English Common law initially and allowed the male of 14 and female of 12 to enter into a marriage contract. However, the law continued changing and today the marriage age for both sexes is different in different states of the United States. The marriages with consent of parents are allowed much earlier than fixed by statutory provisions in different countries and states of the United States. \n Today Trends \n In 1962 the UNO adopted a ‘Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriages’ and stated that men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family. They are entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution. The article 2 of the resolution states that parties to the Convention shall take legislative action to specify a minimum age for marriage. No marriage shall be legally entered into by any person under this age, except where a competent authority has granted a dispensation as to age, for serious reasons, in the interest of the intending spouses. \n The states who have not fixed the marriage age, whether signatories or not, have legislated differently for age of marriage. This list includes most of countries and states of the United States for minimum legal marriage age for men and women. However, different countries have lower bar for male and female to marry with consent of their parents. The Muslim living in these countries are bound to follow the coded marriage age. \n    Age of consentThe age of consent is the age at which a person is considered to be legally competent to consent to sexual acts, and is thus the minimum age of a person with whom another person is legally permitted to engage in sexual activity. The distinguishing aspect of the age of consent laws is that the person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim, and their sex partner as the offender. \n The term age of consent rarely appears in legal statutes.  Generally, a law will instead establish the  age below which it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with that person.

Floyd Sr. was a 1970sï¿½1980s welterweight contender. Floyd Sr. is known for his  defensive ability as well as his overall knowledge of boxing strategy and is  self credited for teaching his son the defensive skills that made him a  champion. \n Biography \n Floyd Mayweather is the  senior member of the Mayweather clan. Younger brother Roger was WBC super  featherweight and super lightweight champion and was known for his offensive  skills. The youngest brother, Jeff , held the IBO super featherweight  title. \n He is known for his  outspokeness. He frequently recited poetry about his opponent and he still does  it today for his fighter's opponnent. Some refer to him as the \"poet laureate of  boxing.\" He is also a flamboyant dresser who wears very colorful suits, ties and  shoes to news conferences. \n Mayweather Sr.'s boxing record  was 29-900-1 (20 KOs). He once stepped into the ring with Hall of Fame Boxer Sugar Ray Leonard \n Floyd Mayweather Sr. taught  Mayweather Jr. how to punch when he was still a toddler in Grand Rapids, Mich. \n When Mayweather Jr. was a year  old, his mother's brother pulled a gun on Mayweather Sr. \"I told him, 'If you're  going to kill him, you're going to kill me too,'\" says Mayweather Sr., who was  holding his son. \"That's all I got in the world.\" The uncle then shot Floyd Sr.  in the leg. \n Prior to his breakup with  his son Floyd Mayweather Jr. , he  not only trained Floyd Jr. but also served as his manager. \n Family Rift \n Floyd Sr. was chosen as  the 1998 Manager of the Year by the Boxing Writers Association of America [1] but the increasingly  brash Mayweather Jr. was tired of being told what to do. The partnership between  father and son stuck together until Floyd Jr won his first world belt, the WBC  super-featherweight title, before son dismissed father in a bitter falling-out.  They did not speak for seven years. The family divide was underlined when Floyd  Jr turned to his uncle, Roger in 2000 , to train him and the pair became a  success. Floyd Sr has not spoken to his brother Roger Mayweather since  1997. \n Trainer \n As a trainer, Mayweather  preaches defense and a stiff jab. He teaches many of his boxers a defensive  technique known as the shoulder roll, in which the fighter uses his front  shoulder to deflect blows and limit their impact. He has on many occasions,  including HBO's Mayweather-Hatton 24/7, claimed to be \"Floyd Joy  Mayweather Sr., 'The Greatest Trainer of All Time'\" \n He is currently the  trainer of WBC light heavyweight champion Chad Dawson , WBO super  featherweight champion Joan Guzman and women's  champion Laila Ali . He is most  well-known for his stint as Oscar De La Hoya 's  trainer from 2001 through 2006. He said he would train De La Hoya for his May 5,  2007, fight against his son, but demanded a $2 million fee to do so. After  considerable deliberation, De La Hoya opted not to hire Mayweather Sr. and  announced on Jan. 30, 2007, he would use Freddie Roach instead.

Initially beginning his career as a chemistry and mathematics teacher after leaving school at the age of 15, Anderson soon entered the Swedish popular music scene, becoming a music producer, manager and also occasional performer.  Anderson had begun writing songs as early as 1951, and in 1959 he got his breakthrough with the song “Är du kär i mig ännu, Klas-Göran?” (“Are You Still In Love With Me, Klas-Göran?”), written for Swedish singer Lill-Babs. During the 1960s he was one of Sweden’s most prolific songwriters, producing more than 3,000 published titles. Anderson also founded Sweden Music in 1960, as well as several other companies. \n By the late 1960s, he was the manager and producer of Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson, who would become the two main songwriters of ABBA. He joined the careers of these two after previously managing the Hootenanny Singers, of which Ulvaeus was a member. Later, in 1972, he began managing Anni-Frid Lyngstad, and finally in 1976 Agnetha Fältskog (until December 1975, Fältskog was still bound to Cupol/CBS Records under a contract). Prior to ABBA’s formation, Björn and Benny were living in a Volkswagen bus and had decided to leave music and gain regular jobs; however, Anderson persuaded them to start a new band, investing considerable money in the group. \n Before his time with ABBA, Anderson managed some of the biggest Swedish artists at that time, and had a huge number of hits on the Swedish charts. His success earned him the nickname “The Business” since he often had several artists in the Top 10 at any time with whom he had written, published, and recorded the songs. When requiring fresh ideas, Anderson would travel to New York, buy songs that had been American hits, and then translate or transcribe the lyrics on the return journey ready for a recording session shortly after and then have the record on the shelves within a few days. The number of songs sent to IFPI/ASCAP for copyright infringement reached over 9,000. \n In the early stages of ABBA, Anderson co-wrote many of the songs’ lyrics, among them some of the band’s biggest hits, such as “Ring Ring” (1973), “Waterloo” (1974), “Honey, Honey” (1974), “I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do” (1975), “Mamma Mia” (1975), “S.O.S” (1975), “Fernando” (1976), “Dancing Queen” (1976), “Knowing Me, Knowing You” (1977), and “The Name of the Game” (1977). \n Frequently known as the fifth member of ABBA, besides contributing to the lyrics, he also owned the record label and the publishing company. Anderson gave shares in the company as gifts to Björn, Benny, and Michael B. Tretow out of friendship as the group became highly successful. Tretow worked on the mixing board and was the sound engineer for the group. According to PolarmusicPrize.org, Anderson’s most treasured award was Billboard Magazine’s “Trendsetter Award”. Such a distinction had only been presented to one European before Anderson, and that was Brian Epstein, manager of The Beatles. \n Anderson was one of the dominant figures behind ABBA, representing their commercial interests and global success through successful record deals. At the same time, he also managed the investment of funds and the enormous financial incomes of Polar Music, holding the majority of stocks. This was an agreement dating back to 1974, and a great deal of the money came from individual record deals he struck for the group, including a ground-breaking agreement for record sales in the Soviet Union in which ABBA recordings were released in exchange for barrels of oil. In the mid-1980s, a considerable part of ABBA’s fortune was lost by mismanagement, bad", "parametric_answer": "fleetwood mac", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

Hoping to bank on the success of HBO’s Game of Thrones, writer Michael Hirst (The Tudors) created the series based on real life figures of Scandanavian history.  The story follows the family saga and rise to power of Ragnar Lothbrok, a great hero who pushed the limits of exploration and rose to become King of the Viking tribes.  Gabriel Byrne and George Blagden are joined by Travis Fimmel, Jessalyn Gilsig, Gustaf Skarsgard, Clive Standen and Katheryn Winnick. Hit the jump for the full press release. \n Check out the details for Vikings in the press release below: \n New \n York, June 28, 2012 – HISTORY announced today additional casting for its new scripted series, VIKINGS, including Travis Fimmel (The Beast, Baytown Outlaws) as Ragnar, the first great Viking leader, a man of both history and myth; Jessalyn Gilsig (Glee, Heroes, CSI: NY, Nip/Tuck, Friday Night Lights,Somewhere Slow) as Siggy, Earl Haraldson’s beautiful wife; Gustaf Skarsgard (The Way Back) as Floki, a close friend of Ragnar’s who is an eccentric jokester yet an inventive, creative boat-builder; Clive Standen (Camelot, Robin Hood) as Rollo, Ragnar’s excessive, cruel cousin; and Katheryn Winnick (Stand Up Guys, A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III, Bones,Love and Other Drugs) as Lagertha, Ragnar’s first wife and famous shield maiden who often fights alongside him. \n Johan Renck (Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead) and Ken Girotti (Rescue Me, Law & Order: Criminal Intent) are  set to direct multiple episodes of the series. The announcement was  made by Nancy Dubuc, President and General Manager, HISTORY and Lifetime  Networks. \n They join previously announced Golden Globe® Award winner and Emmy® Award nominated actor Gabriel Byrne (In Treatment, Usual Suspects, Millers Crossing) who will star as Earl Haraldson, the most important local ruler in Ragnar’s district, and George Blagden (Les Miserables, Wrath of the Titans) who will play Athelstan, an Anglo-Saxon monk captured by Ragnar on his first raid on England. \n VIKINGS will be a series  high on adventure, exploration, conflict, warfare and bloodshed – for  these were extreme times – but, at its heart, it will also be a family  saga. It follows the adventures  of Ragnar Lothbrok, a historical figure, and the greatest hero of his  age – and the gripping sagas of Ragnar’s band of Viking brothers and his  family – as he rises to become King of the Viking tribes. \n Ragnar Lothbrok (Fimmel) is based upon the real-life Viking leader who literally exploded out of  Scandanavia and onto the world stage in the 8th Century. A young  Norwegian farmer with  a wife and family, Ragnar is deeply frustrated by the unadventurous  policies of his local chieftan, Earl Haraldson (Byrne), who  continues to send his Vikings raiders east every summer, to the Baltic  states and Russia, whose populations are as materially  poor as themselves.  Lagertha (Winnick) is the first wife  of Ragnar’s and their marriage is a love-match. Ragnar was first  attracted to Lagertha when she came to fight for a local Norwegian ruler  against an invading Sweden. Floki (Skarsgard), based partly on the Norse god Loki, is  an impish character and ship builder who designs and builds the  prototype of the new generation of Viking ships which can sail across  the open ocean but also up the shallowest of rivers.  He is a design genius and he allows Ragnar to fulfill his dreams of  sailing west and discovering new lands and new civilizations.

{"question": "In which year did divorce become officially legal in the Republic of Ireland?", "answers": ["1997"], "context": "Irish Divorce Law | eHowIrish Divorce Law | Legalbeagle.com \n Irish Divorce Law \n By Roger Thorne \n ireland,limerick image by AGITA LEIMANE from Fotolia.com \n Ireland began allowing couples to divorce starting in 1997. Before that time, the only way a married couple could legally stop being married in Ireland was by getting an annulment. Today, however, Irish couples can seek a divorce, but there are some strict requirements imposed by the law. \n Time \n In Ireland, any couple wishing to divorce must have been married for at least 5 years before they can file for divorce. For 4 of those 5 years, the parties must have lived separately. Irish law doesn't necessarily require the couple to have lived in separate dwellings, merely that they must have lived apart. \n Domicile \n Like other countries, Ireland requires couples seeking a divorce to be residents of Ireland. The married couple, or at least one of the spouses, must be able to show they have lived in Ireland for at least a year. They need not be citizens of Ireland, but at least one party must have been a resident for the entire year prior to filing for divorce. \n Nullity \n Similar to annulment in the United States, Irish couples can seek a nullity decree. This is a court order that the marriage was never valid and therefore legally never existed. Typically, nullity is granted when one party can show that the conditions under which the party was married are legally recognized to void any union. These include already being married, being under the age of 18, failure to observe the 3-month notice requirements, failure to observe a normal marital relationship, lack of consent, marriage between blood relations and same sex marriage. \n Reconciliation \n To grant a divorce, a couple must be able to prove the marriage is irrevocably broken. The 4-year separation is part of this, but the parties must be able to show that there were no attempts at reconciliation in the interim. Breaking up and getting back together several times over the course of the separation period, for example, will probably not be enough to show an irrevocably broken marriage. \n Foreign Divorce \n In cases where one spouse lives in Ireland and the other lives in another country, Ireland can recognize a divorce decree granted by a foreign court. For example, if a spouse lives in the United States and is granted a divorce there, the Irish court will recognize the validity of the divorce even if the requirements for an Irish divorce are not met (such as the 4-year separation requirement). \n References  Republic of IrelandIreland (; ), also known as the Republic of Ireland ('), is a sovereign state in north-western Europe occupying about five-sixths of the island of Ireland.

How do you call the moon? Simply, the call went from the Oval Office in Washington D.C. to Houston, where it was routed into space via Mission Control, through the capsule communicator, or CapCom, astronaut Bruce McCandless II.

{"question": "Which edible nut is found on a variety of Hickory Tree?", "answers": ["pecans", "carya illinoinensis", "pecan"], "context": "Types of Hickory Trees | Home Guides | SF GateTypes of Hickory Trees | Home Guides | SF Gate \n Types of Hickory Trees \n Types of Hickory Trees \n The pecan belongs to the hickory tree family. \n Hickory trees (Carya spp.) are found primarily in the Midwest and Upper Midwest, the Southeast and north into New England and beyond. Of the various types of nuts each species produces, only a few are edible by humans. Hickory trees are also grown for shade, for their hard wood, and as a habitat for birds and other small animals. \n Species Facts \n All hickories reach heights of 50 to 100 feet at maturity with a spread of roughly 40 feet and live for many years. Unless grown commercially, most hickories do not grow in stands but appear individually scattered across a wide area among other trees such as maples, oaks and pines. Most hickories are hardy in U. S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 4 to 8. They are tolerant of most types of soil but generally prefer rich moist but not soggy well-drained soil in sunny areas that receive some shade. The water hickory (Carya aquatica) stands out among its relatives as the most tolerant of moisture and is found primarily in wet woods from Florida to Texas and north to Virginia and southern Illinois. Once fully established, hickory trees such as shagbark (Carya ovata) and shellbark (Carya laciniosa) live hundreds of years. \n Common Hickory Trees \n The three most commonly grown hickories -- the shellbark, or kingnut (Carya laciniosa), the shagbark (Carya ovata) and Southern shagbark (Carya carolinae-septentrionalis) -- are closely related, and they are distinguished by their leaf composition and nut size. All three have the characteristic shaggy bark from which they get their name, but they are not generally found growing in the same area. The Southern shagbark grows primarily in the southeastern states in areas where large deposits of limestone are found, while the shagbark normally grows on dry ridges. The shellbark prefers rich moist bottomlands. All three species have composite leaves, with five leaves per twig on both shagbarks and seven leaves per twig on the shellbark. Nuts of the Southern shagbark are smallest, and those of the shellbark the largest. All are encased in soft outer husks that split open at maturity revealing hard-shelled nuts with a sweet flavor. \n Uses \n Hickory trees such as the shellbark and shagbark are prized not only for their sweet-tasting nuts but for their wood as well. The very hard durable wood is used extensively to manufacture handles for all types of tools including axes and hammers, and the smoke produced by burning the wood is useful to cook and cure meats. Better grades of hickory wood are also used to build furniture and in the manufacture of wall paneling. Not only are hickory nuts appealing to humans, but squirrels, ducks and turkeys enjoy them, and the shagbark and shellbark's peeling bark provide shelter for bats, moths and squirrels. \n Other Hickories \n Other trees belonging to the hickory family include the bitternut hickory (Carya cordiformis), pignut, or black, hickory (Carya glabra), sand hickory (Carya palida), red hickory (Carya ovalis) and the mockernut hickory (Carya tomentosa). The pecan (Carya illinoinensis) is also a type of hickory, grown commercially for its valuable nuts. Lesser-known hickories include the nutmeg hickory (Carya myristiciformis), whose nuts are edible and whose bark is smooth throughout the tree's life spans and curls as the trees age. Others, such as the scrub hickory (Carya floridana), are more localized and found exclusively in parts of central Florida.

{"question": "Whose “left hand” rule can predict the direction of motion of an electric motor?", "answers": ["ambrose fleming", "john ambrose fleming"], "context": "Fleming's left-hand rule for motorsFleming's left-hand rule (for motors), and Fleming's right-hand rule (for generators) are a pair of visual mnemonics. They were originated by John Ambrose Fleming, in the late 19th century, as a simple way of working out the direction of motion in an electric motor, or the direction of electric current in an electric generator.  \n When current flows in a wire, and an external magnetic field is applied across that flow, the wire experiences a force perpendicular both to that field and to the direction of the current flow. A left hand can be held, as shown in the illustration, so as to represent three mutually orthogonal axes on the thumb, first finger and middle finger. Each finger is then assigned to a quantity (mechanical force, magnetic field and electric current). The right and left hand are used for generators and motors respectively. \n Conventions \n * The direction of the mechanical force is the literal one \n * The direction of the magnetic field is from north to south \n * The direction of the electric current is that of conventional current: from positive to negative. \n Mnemonics \n Several memory aids have been used in order to remember the quantity each finger represents. \n First variant \n * The Thumb represents the direction of the Thrust on the conductor / Motion of the Conductor \n * The Fore finger represents the direction of the magnetic Field \n * The Centre finger represents the direction of the Current. \n Second variant \n * The Thumb represents the direction of Motion resulting from the force on the conductor \n * The First finger represents the direction of the magnetic Field \n * The Second finger represents the direction of the Current. \n Third variant \n Van de Graaff's translation of Fleming's rules is the FBI rule, easily remembered because these are the initials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \n This uses the conventional symbolic parameters of F (for Lorentz force), B (for magnetic flux density) and I (for electric current), and attributing them in that order (FBI) respectively to the thumb, first finger and second finger. \n * The thumb is the force, F \n * The first finger is the magnetic flux density, B \n * The second finger is the electric current, I. \n Of course, if the mnemonic is taught (and remembered) with a different arrangement of the parameters to the fingers, it could end up as a mnemonic that also reverses the roles of the two hands (instead of the standard left hand for motors, right hand for generators). These variants are catalogued more fully on the FBI mnemonics page. \n Distinction between the right-hand and left-hand rule \n Fleming's left-hand rule is used for electric motors, while Fleming's right-hand rule is used for electric generators. \n Different hands need to be used for motors and generators because of the differences between cause and effect.  \n In an electric motor, the electric current and magnetic field exist (which are the causes), and they lead to the force that creates the motion (which is the effect), and so the left hand rule is used. In an electric generator, the motion and magnetic field exist (causes), and they lead to the creation of the electric current (effect), and so the right hand rule is used. \n To illustrate why, consider that many types of electric motors can also be used as electric generators. A vehicle powered by such a motor can be accelerated up to high speed by connecting the motor to a fully charged battery. If the motor is then disconnected from the fully charged battery, and connected instead to a completely flat battery, the vehicle will decelerate.  The motor will act as a generator and convert the vehicle's kinetic energy back to electrical energy, which is then stored in the battery. Since neither the direction of motion nor the direction of the magnetic field (inside the motor/generator) has changed, the direction of the electric current in the motor/generator has reversed.

Fly Girls . People &amp; Events | Amy Johnson | PBS \n People & Events \n Amy Johnson (1903 - 1941) \n On May 24, 1930, Amy Johnson, a young British pilot from Hull, touched down in Darwin, Australia.  She had just completed an 8,600-mile journey alone in a two-year-old de Havilland Moth she had named Jason.  The journey had taken her 19 1/2 days.  The press and public were ecstatic.  The \"Daily Mail\" awarded her [sterling]10,000, \"the largest amount ever paid for a feat of daring.\"  The King and Queen of England, the British prime minister, and Charles Lindbergh were among the many dignitaries who sent her congratulatory wishes.  And she was met wherever she went by scores of admiring fans.  But the young aviator, the first woman to fly solo from England to Australia, felt like a failure. She'd set out to break the record time for the trip, set by the Australian pilot, Bert Hinkler in 1928.  Hinkler had made the solo flight from England to Australia in 15 days; Johnson had taken four days longer.   Although Johnson had been planning to fly herself back to Europe, the stress of her public appearances and the degree of her disappointment overwhelmed her.  She returned home on a commercial flight. \n Johnson had learned to fly in 1928 at the London Aeroplane Club.  Her first instructor told her she would never become an aviator.  And in fact it did take her 16 hours of dual flying -- twice as long as was typical -- before she would take her first solo flight.  She finally earned her first pilot's license in July of 1929.  Later that year, after demonstrating an unusual interest for a female aviator of that time in the mechanics of flying, she became the first British woman to qualify as a ground engineer. \n In early 1930, Johnson determined to challenge -- and break -- Hinkler's record.  She won the financial backing of a member of the British aristocracy, Lord Wakefield, and with only 75 hours of flying time she set off from Croydon in South London on May 5, 1930.  Later, Johnson would remark that she had the audacity to undertake the journey because she didn't really know what she was getting herself into.  \"The prospect did not frighten me, because I was so appallingly ignorant that I never realised in the least what I had taken on.\" \n On the fourth day a sandstorm forced her to land and she spent several hours clutching her gun, fearing that the desert dogs she could hear barking in the distance were about to rip her to shreds.  Several days later, after leaving Karachi in what is now Pakistan, she realized she didn't have enough fuel to get her to her next stop, so she made an unscheduled landing that sent military men scurrying from a parade ground.  Johnson flew through monsoon rains and in blistering heat. Along the way, she made several crash landings that caused delays while improvised repairs were made to her plane.  And at one point, after making an unplanned stop in an Indonesian village, she was reported missing. \n Perhaps not achieving her record-breaking goal made Johnson all the more determined to attempt other long-distance flying feats.  In January 1931 she attempted to fly across Siberia to China, but gave up at the end of the month, crash-landing near Warsaw.  In 1932 she beat by eleven hours the record speed for the London to Cape Town journey set earlier by her new husband, Jim Mollison. The following year the newly-weds undertook a joint flying mission: The two took off from Wales for New York.  Ignoring his wife's advice, Mollison refused to refuel in Boston.  They ran out of gas over an airstrip in Connecticut and the couple overshot the runway trying to land their plane in the dark.  They both ended up in a hospital.

The Oxford Dictionaries Word of the Year is a word or expression that has attracted a great deal of interest during the year to date. Language research conducted by Oxford Dictionaries editors reveals that the frequency of the word selfie in the English language has increased by 17,000% since this time last year. \n Selfie can actually be traced back to 2002 when it was used in an Australian online forum.  The word gained momentum throughout the English-speaking world in 2013 as it evolved from a social media buzzword to mainstream shorthand for a self-portrait photograph. Its linguistic productivity is already evident in the creation of numerous related spin-off terms showcasing particular parts of the body like helfie (a picture of one’s hair) and belfie (a picture of one’s posterior); a particular activity – welfie (workout selfie) and drelfie (drunken selfie), and even items of furniture – shelfie and bookshelfie. \n Judy Pearsall, Editorial Director for Oxford Dictionaries, explained the decision: “Using the Oxford Dictionaries language research programme, which collects around 150 million words of current English in use each month, we can see a phenomenal upward trend in the use of selfie in 2013, and this helped to cement its selection as Word of the Year.” \n The Word of the Year need not have been coined within the past twelve months, but it does need to have become prominent or notable in that time. Selfie was added to OxfordDictionaries.com in August 2013, although the Word of the Year selection is made irrespective of whether the candidates are already included in an Oxford dictionary. Selfie is not yet in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), but is currently being considered for future inclusion. \n The earliest known selfie \n Research shows the word selfie in use by 2002. The earliest known usage is found in an Australian online forum post: \n 2002 ABC Online (forum posting) 13 Sept. \n “Um, drunk at a mates 21st, I tripped ofer [sic] and landed lip first (with front teeth coming a very close second) on a set of steps. I had a hole about 1cm long right through my bottom lip. And sorry about the focus, it was a selfie.” \n The rise of the selfie \n Judy Pearsall explained the evolution of the word selfie: “Social media sites helped to popularize the term, with the tag ‘selfie’ appearing on the photo-sharing website Flickr as early as 2004, but usage wasn’t widespread until around 2012, when selfie was being used commonly in mainstream media sources. \n “In early examples, the word was often spelled with a -y, but the -ie form is more common today and has become the accepted spelling. The use of the diminutive -ie suffix is notable, as it helps to turn an essentially narcissistic enterprise into something rather more endearing. Australian English has something of a penchant for -ie words – barbie for barbecue, firie for firefighter, tinnie for a can of beer – so this helps to support the evidence for selfie having originated in Australia.” \n The Word of the Year shortlist \n In alphabetical order, the shortlisted words for the Oxford Dictionaries Word of the Year 2013 are: \n bedroom tax, noun, informal: \n (in the UK) a reduction in the amount of housing benefit paid to a claimant if the property they are renting is judged to have more bedrooms than is necessary for the number of the people in the household, according to criteria set down by the government. \n The Welfare Reform Act 2012 proposed various changes to the rules governing social security benefits in the UK, including", "parametric_answer": "toxic", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}
{"question": "Whose head was stuck on the roof of parliament after his body had been exhumed?", "answers": ["cromwell", "oliver cromwell", "cromwellian"], "context": "Oliver Cromwell's headFollowing the death of Oliver Cromwell on 2 September 1658, he was given a public funeral at Westminster Abbey, equal to those of monarchs before him. After the defeat of King Charles I in the English Civil War and Charles' subsequent beheading, Cromwell had become Lord Protector and ruler of the English Commonwealth. His legacy passed to his son Richard, who was overthrown by the army in 1659, after which monarchy was re-established and King Charles II, who was living in exile, was recalled. Charles' new parliament ordered the disinterment of Cromwell's body from Westminster Abbey and the disinterment of other regicides John Bradshaw and Henry Ireton, for a posthumous execution at Tyburn. After hanging \"from morning till four in the afternoon\",  the bodies were cut down and the heads placed on a 20 foot spike above Westminster Hall (the location of the trial of Charles I). In 1685 a storm broke the pole upon which Cromwell's head stood, throwing it to the ground  (although other sources put the date anywhere between 1672 and 1703), after which it was in the hands of private collectors and museum owners until 25 March 1960, when it was buried at Sidney Sussex College in Cambridge. \n The symbolic value of the head changed over time. While it was spiked on a pole above the London skyline, it gave a potent warning to spectators. In the 18th century, the head became a curiosity and a relic. The head has been admired, reviled, and dismissed as a fake throughout the centuries. After Thomas Carlyle dismissed the head as \"fraudulent moonshine\",Quoted in Fitzgibbons 2008, pp. 78–79 and after the emergence of a rival claimant to the true head of Oliver Cromwell, scientific and archaeological analysis was carried out to prove the identity. Inconclusive tests culminated in a detailed scientific study by Karl Pearson and Geoffrey Morant, which concluded, based on a study of the head and other evidence, that there was a \"moral certainty\"Pearson & Morant 1934, p. 109 that the head belonged to Oliver Cromwell. \n Background \n Oliver Cromwell (born in April 1599) led England into a republic, abolishing the monarchy and the House of Lords, after the execution of King Charles I in January 1649. However, Cromwell's rule as Lord Protector (beginning in December 1653) was not dissimilar to the Personal Rule of his royal predecessors. He maintained sole, unrestricted power, and lived in the many royal palaces. In 1657 he was formally offered the title of King, but after an “agony of mind and conscience” turned it down. Throughout 1658, Cromwell suffered illness and family tragedy, and died on the afternoon of 3 September 1658 (Old Style). \n His death and funeral were treated with the same respect afforded to English monarchs before him. On 20 September, his body was moved to Somerset House to lie in state, which was opened to the public on 18 October. The body had been embalmed, shrouded and sealed in a lead coffin, which in turn was placed in a wooden decorated coffin, placed next to a life-like effigy.  The effigy was decorated with the royal symbols, including: \"a rich Suit of uncut Velvet...laced with a rich gold lace, and furr'd with Ermins; upon the Kirtle is the Royal large Robe of the like Purple Velvet laced, and fur'd with Ermins, with rich strings, and tassels of gold...upon his head, the Cap of Regality of Purple Velvet, furr'd with Ermins...upon the Cushion of the Chair stands the Imperial Crown set with stones.\"  The elaborate funeral procession, delayed twice by hesitant preparations, made its way through London on 23 November 1658. The body itself had already been buried at Westminster Abbey two weeks earlier due to its fast decay (by the time of the funeral procession, he had been dead over two months).  A catafalque had been erected to receive his coffin which was similar to that of King James I, only \"much more stately and expensive\".  \n Cromwell's body lay undisturbed at Westminster until the restoration of the Stuart monarchy under Charles's son", "parametric_answer": "guy fawkes", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

During the late Middle Ages and the Ottoman era, the peninsula was known as the Morea (Greek: Μωρέας, colloq. Μωριάς), a name still in colloquial use. \n The peninsula is divided among three regions of Greece: most of it belongs to the Peloponnese region, and parts belong to the West Greece and Attica regions. \n It was here that the Greek War of Independence began; the Peloponnesians have had an almost total dominance of politics and government in Greece since then.[1] \n Geography \n The Corinth Canal separates the Peloponnese from mainland Greece. \n The Peloponnese covers an area of some 21,549.6  km² (8,320 square miles) and constitutes the southernmost part of mainland Greece. While technically it may be considered an island, since the construction of the Corinth Canal in 1893 – like other peninsulas that have been separated from their mainland by man-made bodies of waters – it is rarely, if ever, referred to as an \"island\". It has two land connections with the rest of Greece, a natural one at the Isthmus of Corinth, and an artificial one in the shape of the Rio-Antirio bridge (completed 2004). \n The peninsula has a mountainous interior and deeply indented coasts, with Mount Taygetus its highest point at 2,407 m. It possesses four south-pointing peninsulas, the Messenian peninsula, the Mani Peninsula, the Cape Malea peninsula (also known as Epidaurus Limera), and the Argolid in the far northeast of the Peloponnese. \n Two groups of islands lie off the Peloponnesan coast: the Argo-Saronic Islands to the east, and the Ionian Islands to the west. The island of Kythera, off the Epidaurus Limera peninsula to the south of the Peloponnese, is considered to be part of the Ionian Islands. \n History \n The theater of ancient Sparta with Mt. Taygetus in the background \n Map of the Peloponnese in classical antiquity \n The peninsula has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Its modern name derives from ancient Greek mythology, specifically the legend of the hero Pelops, who was said to have conquered the entire region. The name Peloponnesos means \"Island of Pelops\". \n Mainland Greece's (and Europe's) first major civilization, the Aegean (or Mycenaean) civilization, dominated the Peloponnese in the Bronze Age, from the stronghold at Mycenae in the north-east of the peninsula. The Mycenean civilization collapsed suddenly at the end of the 2nd millennium BC, with many of its cities and palaces showing signs of destruction. The subsequent period, known as the Greek Dark Ages, is marked by an absence of written records. In 776 BC, the first Olympic Games were held at Olympia, and this date is sometimes used to denote the beginning of the classical period of Greek antiquity. During classical antiquity, the Peloponnese was at the heart of the affairs of ancient Greece, possessed some of its most powerful city-states, and saw some of its bloodiest battles. It was the site of the cities of Sparta, Corinth, Argos and Megalopolis, and was the homeland of the Peloponnesian League. The peninsula was involved in the Persian Wars and was the scene of the Peloponnesian War of 431 BC-404 BC. It fell to the expanding Roman Republic in 146 BC and became the province of Achaea. During the Roman period, the peninsula remained prosperous but became a provincial backwater, relatively cut off from the affairs of the wider Roman world. \n Middle Ages \n Map of the Peloponnese during the Middle Ages. \n Landscape in Arcadia \n Landscape in the Mani Peninsula \n After the partition of the Empire in 395, the Peloponnese became a part of the East Roman or Byzantine Empire.

The latter, which may be more precisely referred to as the slide or Swanee whistle, is commonly made of plastic or metal.  \n The modern slide whistle is perhaps most familiar in its use as a sound effect (as in the sound tracks of animated cartoons, when a glissando can suggest something rapidly ascending or falling, or when a player hits a \"Bankrupt\" on Wheel of Fortune), but it is also possible to play melodies on the slide whistle. \n The swanee whistle dates back at least to the 1840s, when it was manufactured by the Distin family and featured in their concerts in England. Early slide whistles were also made by the English J Stevens & Son and H A Ward. By the 1920s the slide whistle was common in the USA, and was occasionally used in popular music and jazz as a special effect. For example it was used on Paul Whiteman's early hit recording of Whispering (1920).  Even Louis Armstrong switched over from his more usual cornet to the slide whistle for a chorus on a couple of recordings with King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band.  At that time, slide saxophones, with reeds rather than a fipple, were also built. The whistle was also widely used in Jug band music of the 1920s such as Whistler's Jug Band. \n In the 1930s through the 1950s it was played with great dexterity by Paul 'Hezzie' Trietsch, one of the founding members of the Hoosier Hot Shots. They made many recordings. \n A more recent appearance of the slide whistle can be heard in the 1979 song \"Get Up\" by Vernon Burch. The slide whistle segment of this song was later sampled by Deee-Lite in their 1990 hit \"Groove Is in the Heart\". The Las Vegas based band Holes and Hearts also used the slide whistle on their song \"Dancing Monkey\". \n Fred Schneider of The B-52s plays a plastic toy slide whistle in live performances of the song \"Party Out of Bounds\" as a prop for the song's drunken partygoer theme, in place of the trumpet thus used in the studio for the Wild Planet song. \n In 2011 the slide whistle has enjoyed somewhat of a revival, with top session players such as Seadna McPhail guesting on a host of top selling pop albums. \n The slide whistle is probably thought of today primarily as a kind of \"toy\" instrument, especially in the West, although it has been and continues to be used in various forms of \"serious\" music.  Its first appearance in notated European classical music may have been when Maurice Ravel called for one in his opera, L'enfant et les sortilèges. More modern uses in classical music include Paul Hindemith's Kammermusik No. 1, op. 24 no. 1 (1922), Luciano Berio's Passaggio, which uses five, and the Violin Concerto of György Ligeti, as well as pieces by Cornelius Cardew, Alberto Ginastera, Hans Werner Henze, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzysztof Penderecki. The slide whistle is also used in many of the works of P. D. Q. Bach. \n To fans of 1970s BBC children's television, the instrument will always be associated with the voices of the Clangers. The instrument also features prominently in the game of \"Swanee-Kazoo\" in the long-running radio panel game, I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue. \n In the earliest episodes of The Simpsons, the character", "parametric_answer": "donald duck", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

Lennon made six takes of the song in 1979 and 1980 with \"Real Life\", a different song that merged with \"Real Love\". The song was ignored until 1988 when the sixth take was used on the documentary soundtrack Imagine: John Lennon. \n \"Real Love\" was subsequently reworked by the three surviving former members of the Beatles (Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr) in early 1995, an approach also used for another incomplete Lennon track, \"Free as a Bird\". \"Real Love\" was released as a Beatles single in 1996 in the United Kingdom, United States and many other countries; it was the opening track on the Beatles' Anthology 2 album. It is the last \"new\" credited Beatles song to originate and be included on an album. To date, it is the last single by the group to become a Top 40 hit in the US. \n The song reached number four and number 11 in the UK and US singles charts, respectively, and earned a gold record faster than a number of the group's other singles. The song was not included on the BBC Radio 1 playlist, prompting criticism from fans and British members of Parliament. After the release of \"Free as a Bird\" and \"Real Love\", Starr commented, \"Recording the new songs didn't feel contrived at all, it felt very natural and it was a lot of fun, but emotional too at times. But it's the end of the line, really. There's nothing more we can do as the Beatles.\" \n Please note the text from Wikipedia is imported without editing or authentication.  Real Love | The Beatles BibleReal Love | The Beatles Bible \n Wonsaponatime \n The second 'new' Beatles recording made for the Anthology project, Real Love was based on a piano and vocal demo recorded by John Lennon in the late 1970s, and completed a year after Free As A Bird . \n The song began variously as Real Life and Real Love. Lennon recorded a number of demos of both songs, on piano and acoustic guitar, the lyrics to which varied each time. \n At least six takes of Real Love were recorded by Lennon in 1979, one of which was eventually used as the basis for The Beatles' single. \n Other versions of the song have also been released: in 1988 the Imagine: John Lennon soundtrack album began with a guitar-and-vocal recording, of significantly better quality than the one used in 1995. This also appeared on the Acoustic album, released under Lennon's name in 2004. \n The Lennon Anthology box set, from 1998, contained a piano version taped in 1980, which was also included on the highlights disc Wonsaponatime. The song was also included on the 2005 compilation Working Class Hero: The Definitive Lennon. \n In the studio \n Lennon's original demo was recorded on a piano, with a drum machine accompaniment, at Lennon's home in the Dakota building, New York City. A cassette containing the song was given to Paul McCartney by Yoko Ono in January 1994, along with Free As A Bird, Grow Old With Me and Now And Then . \n The sound quality of Real Love was poor, and took considerable preparation in Jeff Lynne's Hollywood studio before overdubs could be added. \n The problem I had with Real Love was that not only was there a 60 cycles mains hum going on, there was also a terrible amount of hiss, because it had been recorded at a low level. I don't know how many generations down this copy was, but it sounded like at least a couple. So I had to get rid of the hiss and the mains hum, and then there were clicks all the way through it.

But what exactly are they seeing? What would you call a group of flamingos, or a flock of eagles? Different types of birds have different collective nouns to describe large groups, and while many of the terms are obsolete, seldom used or just plain silly, they are still familiar to birders. Many of the terms are descriptive not only of the group of birds but also of their behavior or personalities , and birders who understand these esoteric words and can apply them to the appropriate birds will enjoy birding even more. \n Names for Groups of Birds \n Several collective nouns can apply to all bird species , such as flock, colony, fleet, parcel and dissimulation. Other not-so-common flock names that can be used for any type of bird include cloud, mass, collection or just plain group or throng. In fact, any name for a large group - whether it is people, animals or birds - could be applied to a flock. \n continue reading below our video \n 5 Places to Sell Your Crafts \n Birders, however, know there are unique and distinctive names for specific bird flocks. \n Special Flock Names \n When a flock consists of just one type of bird or related species of birds, specialized terms are often used to describe the group. The most colorful and creative flock names include... \n Wrens: Herd, chime \n When Is a Flock a Flock? \n Not every group of birds is automatically a flock. Two characteristics that generally constitute a flock are... \n Numbers: Just two or three birds is not usually a flock, but there is no set minimum number of birds needed to call a group a flock. In general, larger groups are always considered flocks, while smaller groups may be flocks if the birds are not often seen in groups. For example, gregarious birds such as gulls, ducks and starlings are often seen in very large groups, so just a dozen of these birds together would not usually be called a flock. Less social birds, however, such as hummingbirds or grosbeaks, would be considered a flock of there were only a dozen birds, since they are much less likely to gather in larger groups. \n   \n Species: Any large group of birds, no matter how many different species make up the group, can be called a flock if only a general flock term is used. The more unique, specialized terms, however, are only used for single-species flocks. The exception is when all the species that make up the flock are still in the same related family. A flock of sparrows, for example, can still be called a knot, flutter, host, quarrel or crew even if several sparrow species are part of the group. A group of wading birds, however, is just a flock if there are herons, godwits and plovers all mixed in the crowd. \n The collective nouns for different groups of birds can be a fun bit of birding lingo to use when describing what you see in the field.

This followed a campaign to see the flag registered on the basis of popular use and appeal, as had occurred with the flag of Pembrokeshire. In the wake of its burgeoning popularity the local council became involved, after initial reluctance and the flag was duly entered into the competition, which it won by an overwhelming majority. \n Whilst using colours associated with the county, the flag is an entirely novel design, for Dorset was not associated with any ancient traditional symbol, such as the red rose of Lancashire or the Buckinghamshire swan. Unlike most counties, where the civic arms borne by current or former councils, usually feature a charge relating directly to the locality – a symbol used by local rulers for several centuries for example – the arms of the Dorset County Council \n exhibited nothing that bespoke the county at all. \n Awarded in 1950 (February 21st) the arms were adapted from the seal of the county town of Dorchester \n This itself depicted the one time Royal Arms, which quartered the strewn gold fleur-de-lis pattern on blue, of France, with the three gold lions on red of England, set against the old castle that used to stand in the town. \n In 1889, upon its creation, the County Council settled on a seal of its own, taking the same three lions passant of England, as appeared in the Dorchester seal. The council formally applied for arms in 1949, the resultant design again echoed the emblem used by Dorchester, combing the three lions of England with a single French fleur-de- lis, all in red, against a white background. The choice of these specific colours seems to be unaccounted for but aside from this aspect there was nothing about these arms that was particularly symbolic or distinctive of the county. Therefore, when an armorial banner formed from these arms, \n was subsequently made commercially available and misleadingly marketed as the “county flag of Dorset” it was a particularly inapt design for this use; not only did it actually represent only the council as the bearer of the arms but as seen, the pattern had no reference to the county of Dorset but rather to the kingdoms of England and France! Additionally the arms did not translate well as a flag – the elongated bodies, further squashed by the “flower” at the base, were not easily rendered by a child’s hand. \n Accordingly, dissatisfied with this putative county flag, Dorset people sought something more meaningful and better designed. In 2006 Dave White of Dorchester engaged with Dorset expatriate, Stephen Coombs, to design a flag for the county. Stephen had considered a design, to be dedicated to St.Wite \n a local woman from the west of the county who worked tirelessly for the local community, killed during a Viking attack in 831AD. A student of heraldry, alive to the principles of good design as promoted by the Flag Institute and others, Stephen wanted a flag that was simple, easy to recognise and draw. Conscious of the flags borne by Dorset’s neighbours, Cornwall’s ancient white cross \n and the recently adopted Devonian black edged white cross on a green background \n as well as other cross flags such as Lincolnshire \n he too opted  for a cross pattern which he felt had become something of a standard pattern for English county flags. \n The red and white of the Council’s arms were the source for his chosen colours but he wanted to add a third tincture for more distinctiveness. Recognising that red, gold (yellow) and white was a colour combination rarely seen on flags, this was the set he opted for. As with the flag of Devon he proposed a flag with a cross that was edged (in heraldic terms “fimbriated”) and so suggested a yellow flag bearing a red edged, white cross.

Credit: Daniel Hargreaves \n The Kitti’s hog-nosed bat (Craseonycteris thonglongyai), sometimes referred to as the bumblebee bat due to its diminutive size, was discovered in 1970s and could arguably be the world’s smallest mammal, depending on how size is defined. \n C. thonglongyai is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN and is found in western Thailand and southeast Burma, in limestone caves along rivers. It is the only existing member of the family Craseonycteridae. Its coat is reddish-brown or gray, with a distinctive pig-like snout. Colonies vary in size, but most have an average of 100 individuals per cave. Some caves will have smaller groups from 10 to 15, while others will have up to 500. The bat feeds in short bursts of activity during evenings and dawn, foraging for insects. Its wings seem to be adapted for hovering flight. \n The status in Burma is not well known, but the population in Thailand is restricted to a single province and may be at risk for extinction. The principal threats to its survival are mostly anthropogenic, including habitat degradation and the disturbance of roosting sites. \n The bat is about 29 to 33 mm (1.1″ to 1.3″) in length and weighs 2 g (0.074 oz). Some small shrews, including the Etruscan shrew (Suncus etruscus), may be lighter but they are longer. C. thonglongyai‘s closest relatives are bats from the families Hipposideridae and Rhinopomatidae. \n There’s much about C. thonglongyai that remains unknown. Scientists know little about their reproductive behavior, or how they evade predators. It’s also unknown whether colonies stay in one cave or move around to others. This bat does use echolocation.

{"question": "In Roman times what was the occupation of a publican?", "answers": ["tax collector", "tax-gatherer", "tax collectors", "tax gatherer"], "context": "Ancient Tax Collector (Bible History Online)Ancient Tax Collector (Bible History Online) \n Ancient Tax Collector \n Illustration of a Publican in    his Office \n During the time of Jesus in    first century Israel, there were publicans and tax collectors who    could walk up to a man and tax him for what he was carrying, and    much more. These tax collectors were hated and despised because they    were usually fellow Jews who worked for Rome. There were many taxes    needed from the provinces to administrate the Roman Empire. These    taxes paid for a good system of roads, law and order, security,    religious freedom, a certain amount of self government and other    benefits. \n The Publican \n The publican is from    the Latin word \"publicanus\", and from the Greek word \"telones\" which    mean a tax gatherer. The publican is mentioned quite often    throughout the life of Christ. Since Israel was under Roman rule,    and part of a province of the Roman Empire, customs duties were    farmed out to chief tax collectors (publicani). These chief tax    collector's what also farm these duties over to the regular tax    collectors. \n In the eyes of Rome    the provinces were to carry the heavy weight of administering the    Empire. Judea was in the province of Syria and every man was to pay    1% of his annual income for income tax. But that was not all, there    were also import and export taxes, crop taxes (1/10 of grain crop    and 1/5 of wine, fruit, and olive oil), sales tax, property tax,    emergency tax, and on and on. It was actually a Roman official    (censor) who was ultimately responsible to Rome for collecting the    revenue of the province, but he sold the rights to extort tax to the    highest bidders. \n Most of the time when    the Bible mentions a publican, or a tax collector it is referring to    a regular tax collector (publicanus) rather than a chief tax    collector. The tax collectors were usually Jewish and therefore they    were hated by their own people. When they collected their taxes for    Rome they would turn over the required amount of money, and whatever    they could add on for themselves is what they kept. They were known    to be extortioners of large sums of money. Because tax collectors    were in relationship with Rome, who were Gentiles in the eyes of the    Jews, and hated for their domination, they were treated similar to    the worst kinds of sinners and prostitutes. \n Jesus showed much    kindness to the publicans, and he was even mentioned as having had    dinner with them, which in Israel was a sign of fellowship. (Luke 18    and 19). In fact one of his apostles named Matthew (Levi) was a tax    collector, and became an author of one of the accounts of the life    of Christ known as the book of Matthew. \n Luke 15:1 - \"Then drew    near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to    hear him.\" \n   \n Publican in    the Bible Encyclopedia - ISBE \n Sufficient cause for the    unpopularity of publicans in New Testament times is not far seek.    Hatred of paying duties seems to be ingrained in human nature.    Customs officials are always unpopular. The method is necessarily    inquisitorial. The man who opens one's boxes and bundles to appraise    the value of what one has, is at best a tolerated evil. In Judea,    under the Roman system, all circumstances combined to make the    publican the object of bitter hatred. He represented and exercised    in immediate contact, at a sore spot with individuals, the hatred    power of Rome. The tax itself was looked upon as an inherent    religious wrong, as well as civil imposition, and by many the    payment of it was considered a sinful act of disloyalty to God.

Soldiers were paid three times a year in Aureus. It seems that an Aureus (the gold standard of the time) had a special symbolic valuewith the troops.  The silver coin was the denarius, with 25 denarii for one aureus. Twenty-five denarii equaled one aureus and the denarius was at one time considered the basic coin and unit of account. In 89 bc, the sestertius, equal to one-quarter of a denarius, replaced the bronze ass as a unit of account. In Constantine's reform of ad 312, the aureus was replaced by the solidus as the basic monetary unit. \n Servius Tullius was the first who caused money to be coined, by stamping on brass the image of cattle (pecudes whence the term pec-unia). Previously, exchanges were made by barter, or by means of uncoined metal. The most common brass coin, the as, was originally a Roman pound in weight and was divided like that into twelve ounces. The As was originally the unit of ihe Roman currency, and contained a pound of copper, but it was diminished from time to time in weight and value till at last it contained only 1/24 of a pound. \n Silver coin was first stamped B. C. 269; the most common coins were the Denarius, Quinarius and Sestertius. The Denarius was originally reckoned as equal to ten pounds of brass, marked X, or )(, and contained originally 2.5 asses (when the as was still the primary Roman monetary unit), the quinarius 5, and the dinarius 10 but after the reduction of the as to an ounce BC 217, it passed as equal to sixteen asses.  The Quinarius was half the Denarius, and marked V. The Sestertius was a fourth part of the Denarius, and originally equal to 2 1/2 asses (hence its name semis tertius), and marked LLS i.e. Libra Libra Semis, abbreviated IIS or HS. After the reduction of the as to one ounce, the Sestertius passed for 4 asses. \n Pliny the Elder relates that \"Silver was not impressed with a mark until the year of the City 485, the year of the consulship of Q. Ogulnius and C. Fabius, five years before the First Punic War; at which time it was ordained that the value of the denarius should be ten librï¿½ [\"Pounds\" or \"asses\"] of copper, that of the quinarius five librï¿½, and that of the sestertius two librï¿½ and a half. The weight, however, of the libra of copper was diminished during the First Punic War, the republic not having means to meet its expenditure: in consequence of which, an ordinance was made that the as should in future be struck of two ounces weight. By this contrivance a saving of five-sixths was effected, and the public debt was liquidated.\" \n Gold coin was first stamped at Rome BC 207; the most common coin was the Aureus or Solidvs, equal in weight to two Denarii and a Quinarius, and in value to 25 Denarii. Pliny the Elder relates that \"The first golden coin was struck sixty-two years after that of silver, the scruple of gold being valued at twenty sesterces; a computation which gave, according to the value of the sesterce then in use, nine hundred", "parametric_answer": "as", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

Taking her first breath in 30 seconds Sally smiles as she recalls her opponent taking her legs out from underneath her, just metres from the half way line. But her middle finger just crosses the chalky markings; the first point on the kabaddi score sheet is hers and so begins this match of one against seven. \n Combining the art of wrestling, the strength of rugby and the thrill of tag, the ancient sport of kabaddi is one step closer to achieving its Olympic ambitions with 41 countries now competing in the game, according to Ashok Das, England women’s kabaddi coach and the vice-president of the International Kabaddi Federation (IKF). \n \"It's a game of speed and strength combined. The women’s game is faster than the men’s and the time will come when they will have the upper hand\" \n England women's kabaddi coach, Ashok Das \n \"We want to take kabaddi into the Olympic Games. We have done a lot of work to get people into the game. We have coaches in Iran, Afghanistan and Malaysia. Most of the best coaches are from India because this game comes from India,\" said the 49-year-old with a hint of pride in his voice. \n This 4,000 year-old sport is played inside a 70m-diameter circle, with the two teams being made up of stoppers and raiders, who try to tag one of the four stoppers and then return into their own half within 30 seconds without being caught. \n A successful raid must be completed in a single breath, whilst repeatedly chanting the word kabaddi. \n “It’s a game of speed and strength combined. The women’s game is faster than the men’s and the time will come when they will have the upper hand,\" said Das, who has been coaching kabaddi for nine years. \n “Wherever we play with the women’s team there are thousands of people supporting us. In the past they have said the women are weaker, but people actually enjoy the women’s game more. Women give 100 percent and show no mercy. They call us the gorilla fighters, it is guerrilla warfare when they are on the field.”  \n The team and Coach Das are keen to recruit younger members. Das, an ex-kabaddi player born in Punjab, introduced the sport to the British Army in 2005 as a way of keeping fit. \n With an all white team, made up of army personnel, teachers, a police officer and a pig farmer amongst others, England’s women’s kabaddi players refused to let issues of gender or race get in their way at the Kabaddi World Cup in December. \n The 12-strong team grappled their way to the semi-finals, losing out to eventual winners India. \n Rugby crossover \n Like most of the team, England’s star raider Sally Tidswell found her rugby skills to be invaluable when she made the move across to kabaddi nine months ago. \n She said: “It’s similar to rugby in a way because you have to be agile, get around people and you have to be quick. It’s like rugby without the ball. It’s definitely slower than rugby though, because the raider is coming in and out. Not wearing shoes, playing in a small circle and coming in and out are all difficult.” \n \"The crowds were big and we’re not used to that. There were definitely thousands cheering us on. This helped us; they cheered us on because we were different to the other teams,” said the 30-year-old science teacher. \n \"We want to get the game into the Olympics, especially after the news that wrestling had been dropped from the games.

Get a full year for just $7.99!  DessertDessert is a course that concludes a main meal. The course usually consists of sweet foods and beverages, such as dessert wine or liqueurs, but may include coffee, cheeses, nuts, or other savory items. In some parts of the world, such as much of central and western Africa, there is no tradition of a dessert course to conclude a meal. \n The term \"dessert\" can apply to many foods, such as cakes, tarts,  cookies, biscuits, gelatins, pastries, ice creams, pies, puddings, custards, and sweet soups. Fruit is also commonly found in dessert courses because of its naturally occurring sweetness.  Some cultures sweeten foods that are more commonly savory to create desserts. \n Etymology  \n The word \"dessert\" originated from the French word desservir, meaning \"to clear the table.\" Its first known use was in 1600, in a health education manual entitled Naturall and artificial Directions for Health, which was written by William Vaughan.   In his A History of Dessert (2013), Michael Krondl explains it refers to the fact dessert was served after the table had been cleared of other dishes. The term dates from the 14th century but attained its current meaning around the beginning of the 20th century when \"service à la française\" (setting a variety of dishes on the table at the same time) was replaced with \"service à la russe\" (presenting a meal in courses.)\" \n Usage  \n The word dessert is most commonly used for this course in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland whilst Pudding is more commonly used in the United Kingdom. Alternatives such as \"sweets\" or \"afters\" are also used in the United Kingdom  and some other Commonwealth countries, including Hong Kong, and India. \n History  \n Sweets were fed to the gods in ancient Mesopotamia  and India and other ancient civilizations.  Dried fruit and honey were likely the first sweeteners used in most of the world, but the spread of sugarcane around the world was essential to the development of dessert. \n Sugarcane was grown and refined in India before 500 BCE and was crystallized, making it easy to transport, by 500 CE. Sugar and sugarcane were traded, making sugar available to Macedonia by 300 BCE and China by 600 CE.  In South Asia, the Middle East and China, sugar has been a staple of cooking and desserts for over a thousand years. Sugarcane and sugar were little known and rare in Europe until the twelfth century or later, when the Crusades and then colonialization spread its use. \n Europeans began to manufacture sugar in the Middle Ages, and more sweet desserts became available.   Even then sugar was so expensive usually only the wealthy could indulge on special occasions.  The first apple pie recipe was published in 1381.  The earliest documentation of the term cupcake was in \"Seventy-five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes, and Sweetmeats\" in 1828 in Eliza Leslie's Receipts cookbook.  \n The Industrial Revolution in America and Europe caused desserts (and food in general) to be mass-produced, processed, preserved, canned, and packaged.  Frozen foods became very popular starting in the 1920s when freezing emerged.  These processed foods became a large part of diets in many industrialized nations.  Many countries have desserts and foods distinctive to their nations or region.  \n Ingredients  \n Sweet desserts usually contain cane sugar, palm sugar, honey or some type of syrup such as molasses, maple syrup, treacle, or corn syrup. Other common ingredients in Western-style desserts are flour or other starches, fats such as butter or lard, dairy", "parametric_answer": "blackberry", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

Retrieved 2 December 2008. is a central London railway terminus and Grade I listed building  located on Euston Road in the London Borough of Camden. \n Widely known for its Victorian architecture, the station stands between the British Library, King's Cross station and the Regent's Canal. It was opened in 1868 by the Midland Railway as the southern terminus of its main line which connected London with the East Midlands and Yorkshire. When it opened, the arched Barlow train shed was the largest single-span roof in the world. \n After escaping planned demolition in the 1960s, the complex was renovated and expanded from 2001 to 2007 at a cost of £800 million with a ceremony attended by Queen Elizabeth II and extensive publicity introducing it as a public space. A security-sealed terminal area was constructed for Eurostar services to continental Europe via High Speed 1 and the Channel Tunnel, with platforms for domestic trains to the north and south-east of England. The restored station has 15 platforms, a shopping centre and a coach facility, and is served by London Underground's King's Cross St. Pancras station. St Pancras is owned by HS1 and is managed by Network Rail (High Speed), a subsidiary of Network Rail.  \n Background \n Overview \n The station is the terminus for East Midlands Trains services from London to Derby, Leicester, Nottingham, Sheffield, and smaller towns en route, and for Eurostar's high-speed trains to Paris, Brussels and Lille.  Thameslink trains on the cross-London Thameslink route call at platforms beneath the main station, south to Gatwick Airport and Brighton and north to Luton Airport Parkway for Luton Airport and Bedford. High-speed domestic services to Kent, run by Southeastern, began in December 2009.  \n St Pancras is often termed the \"cathedral of the railways\", and includes two of the most celebrated structures built in Britain in the Victorian era. The train shed, completed in 1868 by the engineer William Henry Barlow, was the largest single-span structure built up to that time.  The frontage of the station is formed by the former Midland Grand Hotel, designed by George Gilbert Scott, an example of Victorian Gothic architecture, now occupied by the five-star Renaissance London Hotel and apartments.  \n The terminal is one of relatively few railway stations in England to feature multilingual signage; all notices are written in English and French. Ashford International station has similar bilingual signs. Other stations with foreign-language signs include Southall, which has signs in Punjabi, Wallsend Metro station (Latin),  and Moreton-in-Marsh (Japanese).  In March 2014, the station's public relations team commissioned a study of mispronounced words, reportedly as a result of passengers referring to the station as \"St Pancreas\".  \n Location \n St Pancras occupies a site orientated north/south, deeper than it is wide. The south is bounded by the busy Euston Road, with the frontage provided by the former Midland Grand Hotel. Behind the hotel, the Barlow train shed is elevated 5 m (17 ft) above street level, with the area below forming the station undercroft. To the west, the original station is bounded by Midland Road with the British Library on the other side of the road. To the east, it is bounded by Pancras Road and is opposite King's Cross station. The new northern half of the station is mainly bounded to the east by Camley Street, with Camley Street Natural Park across the road.

Chaplin dabbled with a few different wives, and had a number of children throughout his life. \n Charlie Chaplin's Four Wives \n Charlie Chaplin was married four times during his life. Let us look at a little bit of information about his four wives, the marriages, and the reasons why the marriages ended. \n Mildred Harris \n When Mildred was only 16 years old, she met Chaplin at a party. They spent several months dating each other and were married on October 23, 1918, when Mildred was still only 16 years of age. One of the reasons why they married so early was because Mildred told Chaplin that she was pregnant. Interestingly enough though, that turned out to be false. Perhaps Mildred really did think she was pregnant, or maybe she just wanted Chaplin to marry her. \n Mildred and Charlie's lifestyles were very different, and she did not like that he spent so much time at work. They had a child together, named Norman Spencer on July 7, 1919. However, he only lived for three days. This event also put stress on the marriage, and the marriage ended the next year on November 13, 1920. \n Lillita McMurray \n While married to Mildred, Chaplin was working on the film The Kid. Chaplin's next wife, Lillita McMurray was a star in this film. While he was getting the movie The Gold Rush together, the pair met again and Chaplin signed her to the film. Lillita was 16 years old and Chaplin was 36 when they began to romance each other. They were married on November 26, 1924, just over four years after he divorced his first wife. \n Only a few months later, Lillita gave birth to their first child together, who was named Charles Chaplin, Jr. He was born on May 5, 1925. About a year later, on March 30, 1926, Sydney Chaplin entered the world. In November of 1926, their marriage ended in a bitter divorce. \n Paulette Goddard \n When Paulette met Chaplin in the early 1930s, she was in her early 20s, making her the oldest of all of Chaplin's wives. They went on a trip to the Orient together, after a period of romancing. When they returned, they claimed that they had been married while there. People have remained skeptical about their marriage, as official marriage papers were never produced. Therefore, Chaplin may have only had three wives, but he claimed to have had four. \n They started to grow apart, so they eventually divorced on June 4, 1942. They had no children together, but Paulette had played mother to Chaplin's other two children. \n Oona O'Neill \n Chaplin took an interest in the 17 year old Oona O'Neill in 1942, not long after the divorce with Paulette Goddard had occurred. Chaplin was supposed to be giving Oona acting lessons, but they soon began to see each other romantically. They were married on June 16, 1943 in Santa Barbara, California. Chaplin was 54 years old and Oona was 18 years old. \n The couple had eight children together during their life together. The youngest was born when Charlie was 73 years old. His children with Oona were: \n Geraldine Leigh \n Annette Emily \n Christopher James \n They stayed together for the rest of his life, and Chaplin died on Christmas Day in 1977.

A team of English players took on a side made up of Scottish, Welsh and Irish players in the sweltering Indian heat. \n The match led to the formation of the Calcutta Football Club in 1873, but by 1877 the club had wilted in the heat of the subcontinent and disbanded. \n The club’s funds were withdrawn from the bank as silver rupees, which were then melted down and made into a cup. \n The Rugby Football Union in England were given the Cup, and decided to award it to the winners of an annual game between Scotland and England. \n The first clash for the Calcutta Cup ended in a draw, at Edinburgh’s Raeburn Place in March of 1879. The fixture has taken place every year since, with the only breaks coming for the two World Wars, and competition for the Cup remains as fierce as ever. \n The trophy has seen its share of trouble, including an infamous 1988 episode where the trophy was used as a rugby ball by Scotland star John Jeffrey and England’s Dean Richards. Jeffrey admitted to his role in the hijinks - largely to quash rumours he had kicked the Cup down Princes Street. \n When the sides meet in front of over 60,000 baying fans on Saturday night, the prize of the old trophy will be as sought-after as it was over 130 years ago, even if the Indian weather fails to make an appearance in Edinburgh.

{"question": "Which kind of food can be either ‘blanket’ or ‘honeycomb’?", "answers": ["tripes", "beef tripe", "trippa", "tripe"], "context": "Honeycomb structureHoneycomb structures are natural or man-made structures that have the geometry of a honeycomb to allow the minimization of the amount of used material to reach minimal weight and minimal material cost. The geometry of honeycomb structures can vary widely but the common feature of all such structures is an array of hollow cells formed between thin vertical walls. The cells are often columnar and hexagonal in shape. A honeycomb shaped structure provides a material with minimal density and relative high out-of-plane compression properties and out-of-plane shear properties.  \n Man-made honeycomb structural materials are commonly made by layering a honeycomb material between two thin layers that provide strength in tension. This forms a plate-like assembly. Honeycomb materials are widely used where flat or slightly curved surfaces are needed and their high Specific strength is valuable. They are widely used in the aerospace industry for this reason, and honeycomb materials in aluminum, fibreglass and advanced composite materials have been featured in aircraft and rockets since the 1950s. They can also be found in many other fields, from packaging materials in the form of paper-based honeycomb cardboard, to sporting goods like skis and snowboards. \n Introduction  \n Natural honeycomb structures include beehives, honeycomb weathering in rocks, tripe, and bone. \n Man-made honeycomb structures include sandwich-structured composites with honeycomb cores. Man-made honeycomb structures are manufactured by using a variety of different materials, depending on the intended application and required characteristics, from paper or thermoplastics, used for low strength and stiffness for low load applications, to high strength and stiffness for high performance applications, from aluminum or fiber reinforced plastics. The strength of laminated or sandwich panels depends on the size of the panel, facing material used and the number or density of the honeycomb cells within it.  Honeycomb composites are used widely in many industries, from aerospace industries, automotive and furniture to packaging and logistics.   \n The material takes its name from its visual resemblance to a bee's honeycomb – a hexagonal sheet structure. \n History  \n The hexagonal comb of the honey bee has been admired and wondered about from ancient times. The first man-made honeycomb is said to have been manufactured by Daedalus from gold by lost wax casting more than 3000 years ago.  Marcus Varro reports that the Greek geometricians Euclid and Zenodorus found that the hexagon shape makes most efficient use of space and building materials. The interior ribbing and hidden chambers in the dome of the Pantheon in Rome is an early example of a honeycomb structure.  \n Galileo Galilei discusses in 1638 the resistance of hollow solids: \"Art, and nature even more, makes use of these in thousands of operations in which robustness is increased without adding weight, as is seen in the bones of birds and in many stalks that are light and very resistant to bending and breaking”.  \n Robert Hook discovers in 1665 that the natural cellular structure of cork is similar to the hexagonal honeybee comb.  and Charles Darwin states in 1859 that \"the comb of the hive-bee, as far as we can see, is absolutely perfect in economizing labour and wax”.  \n The first paper honeycomb structures might have been made by the Chinese 2000 years ago for ornaments, but no reference for this has been found. Paper honeycombs and the expansion production process has been invented in Halle/Saale in Germany by Hans Heilbrun in 1901  for decorative applications. First honeycomb structures from corrugated metal sheets had been proposed for bee keeping in 1890.  For the same purpose, as foundation sheets to harvest more honey, a honeycomb moulding process using a paper paste glue mixture had been patented in 1878.  The three basic techniques for honeycomb production that are still used today—expansion, corrugation and moulding—were already developed by 1901 for non-sandwich applications. \n Hugo Junkers first explored the idea of a honeycomb core within a laminate structure. He proposed and patented the first honeycomb cores for aircraft application in 1915.  He described in detail his concept to replace the fabric covered aircraft structures by metal sheets and reasoned that a metal sheet can also be loaded in compression if it is supported", "parametric_answer": "beeswax", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}
{"question": "Legend has it in Britain that which bird never uses its voice until it is dying?", "answers": ["swan"], "context": "Birds - khandro.netBirds \n   \n Introduction \n Birds play an important symbolic role because they travel in 3 of the  5 traditional elements: air, earth and water.  In mythology, the Celestial  Bird adds the element of space to that repertoire and the Phoenix, fire.   \n The Hamsa is a celestial bird that is the vehicle of Indian deities, Brahma and Saraswati .  It most often depicted today as a swan --  sometimes the word is translated by gander [male goose] but it is not to be considered an ordinary bird at all.   Mythologist Joseph Campbell,  entitling one of his books Flight of the Wild Gander , was referring to this  bird. \n Their remarkably expressive voices, variety of form and sometimes spectacular coloration contributes to the prestige and mythological importance of birds.  For example, the Kalavinka is a bird of a Buddhist paradise whose voice is described in part 16 of Ashvaghosha's Acts of the Buddha as the most beautiful of all voices -- so clear and melodious.  \n After becoming popular in 9th-century Japan, a Chinese T'ang dynasty opera featuring the kalvinka became known by that name.  It is still being performed today.  Four little boys with wings and flowery crowns play little cymbals that are intended to imitate the kalavinka's timbre. \n Besides mythological birds of the celestial class that include the hamsa, the garuda and the kalavinka, many ordinary kinds of bird, such as the peacock , dove, goose -- especially the beautifully marked bar-headed goose (Anser indicus) -- and the ruddy [reddish] duck, the parrot, owl, crow, raven, vulture, eagle, cuckoo, crane and the common cockerel (gallus, rooster) also figure prominently in mythology, folklore, literature and iconography. \n Behavior \n Important meaning is attached to the behaviour of birds.  For example, the surface of Sikkim's Khecheod-palri Lake is surrounded by trees but it is kept stainless as a mirror.  As soon as a leaf falls on the water's surface, a guardian bird arrives to snatch it away.  Here, the lake can be compared to our stainless Buddha Nature, and the tidying birds are like our attentiveness to our own mental states.  \n In the cultures of Asia, no creature is considered more sexually active than a bird.  A cock is any male bird.  Not surprisingly, it is an English slang word for the male organ.   \n The Pair \n Birds are also seen as symbolic of fidelity, duty and devotion.  Who has not been impressed with the lengths to which parents will go to guard the nest and care for their hatchlings?  But also, many birds pair off for a lifetime.  \n A pair of birds is a way of depicting fidelity all over the world.  \n This duality is taken in a different direction with the image of a bird with two heads.  For example, in thangkas (Tibetan painted scrolls) sometimes there appear two double-headed birds.  The parrot represents two early masters, Kawa Peltsek and Choro                                              Lu'i Gyeltsen, who first rendered the Buddhist scriptures into Tibetan from Sanskrit. The other is a duck that stands for two 8th-century Indian masters, Shantarakshita and his student, Kamalashila.  \n Metamorphosis \n There are many folktales in which women or men transform into birds, especially swans.  The Brothers Grimm collected a tale about a sister who had to make shirts that would keep her brothers in human form.  The ballet, Swan Lake has two swan maidens under the spell of an owl magician.  This type of motif often derives from sacred teachings or mythology.  Here, the metamorphosis is suggested by  this very ancient Mycenaen [very early Greek] image of three   goddesses, who seem to have arrived in  the form of 3 swans.  They are presenting an  offering to their champion. \n About the serpent [also in the above  image.] \n Owl \n Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom and war, is represented by the owl which is also the symbol of her city, Athens", "parametric_answer": "nightingale", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

True, False and which other?", "answers": ["floating"], "context": "The Ribs - The Human Skeletal SystemThe Ribs - The Human Skeletal System \n The Human Skeletal System \n References \n The Ribs \n The ribs are flat, thin bones that, together with  the sternum , make up the ribcage. The ribs provide protection for vital organs in the upper body, including the heart and lungs.  The ribs also help to protect major vessels in the upper body.  There are twelve pairs of ribs, accounting for 24 total rib bones.  The ribs are divided into the following three categories:  true ribs, false ribs, and floating ribs.  The primary differences are size, and how they connect to the front of the skeleton.  Below is a more detailed description of the three categories. \n True Ribs \n The first seven pairs of rib bones (beginning at the top of the sternum ) are called \"true ribs.\"  They connect to the spine (by ligaments) at the back, and connect to the sternum  by costal cartilage in the front.  Costal cartilage is elastic and allows the ribcage to expand during respiration. \n False Ribs \n The next three pairs of rib bones (8, 9 and 10) are called \"false ribs.\"  Like the true ribs, false ribs are connected to the spine at the back.  The primary difference in true ribs and false ribs comes in where the false ribs connect at the front.  Instead of connecting to the sternum , false ribs (which are also slightly shorter than true ribs) actually connect to the lowest true ribs (this may be observed in the picture, above). \n Floating Ribs \n The last two pairs of ribs (11 and 12) are the smallest of all of the rib bones, and are called \"floating ribs.\"  They get the name \"floating rib\" because they are connected to the spin at the back, but are not connected to anything at the front, thus appearing to \"float.\" \n In addition to protecting vital organs, such as the heart and lungs, the ribs serve other important purposes in the human body.  The ribs give shape and support to the chest.  They protect parts of other organs, including the stomach, spleen and kidneys.  The ribs also help humans to breathe.  The cartilage that connects the true ribs to the sternum allows the chest to expand when you inhale and the lungs fill with air.  The rigidity and mass of the rib bones then help to contract the lungs and expel air when you exhale. \n Create a free website  Human Body - Ribs - Scoliosis - scoliosisnutty.comHuman Body - Ribs \n Human Body - Ribs \n Spine Tips \n Human Body - Ribs \n The ribs are thin, flat, curved bones that form a protective cage around the organs in the upper body.

{"question": "Which is heaviest of all naturally-occurring elements?", "answers": ["uranium"], "context": "The heaviest naturally occurring element on Earth ...The heaviest naturally occurring element on Earth? | Chemical connections \n The heaviest naturally occurring element on Earth? \n Posted on May 15, 2014 by stu \n OK, let’s make sure that we’re clear on the question first. By ‘heaviest’, I mean the element with the largest atomic number. By ‘naturally occurring’, I mean pretend that humans have never existed on this planet (probably would have turned out much nicer, eh?). Right, you can’t argue about the question anymore, and if you still want to, go and do it somewhere else – all I want now are arguments about the answer. \n A lot of people (well, science-y types I guess) when posed with this question will say ‘uranium’. \n But hang on, naturally occurring uranium can apparently undergo neutron capture reactions followed by beta decay to produce transuranium elements… but I’m struggling to find (primary) literature sources confirming just how far this process goes. Also note that plutonium is thought to be a primordial element (there might be some on Earth that has been around longer than the Earth itself) – the Nature paper is here and a potential rebuttal is here (thanks to Brett Thornton for pointing this out on Twitter ). \n After digging around Wikipedia for a while (and lots of the sources it links to), I’m fairly convinced that it is safe to say that neptunium and plutonium are found in nature – in naturally occurring uranium deposits and natural nuclear reactors such as the one found at Oklo in Gabon. \n What about the next few elements though? Well, here’s what Wikipedia has to say: \n Am: A few atoms of americium can be produced by neutron capture reactions and beta decay in very highly concentrated uranium-bearing deposits. [ link ] \n Cm: A few atoms of curium can be produced by neutron capture reactions and beta decay in very highly concentrated uranium-bearing deposits. [ link ] \n Bk: A few atoms of berkelium can be produced by neutron capture reactions and beta decay in very highly concentrated uranium-bearing deposits, thus making it the rarest naturally occurring element. [ link ] \n Cf: Very minute amounts of californium have been found to exist on Earth due to neutron capture reactions and beta decay in very highly-concentrated uranium-bearing deposits. [ link ] \n The Wikipedia page on californium also states that: It is the heaviest element to occur naturally on Earth; heavier elements can only be produced by synthesis. \n Notice that the wording for all of these elements is very similar. And they all cite the same (and only) source – John Emsley’s book Nature’s Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements. I don’t have a copy of Emsley’s book to hand and so I’m still in the dark about primary literature sources to back up these claims (I’m not doubting the book, I’d just like to find the original sources). \n When it comes to the next two elements, einsteinium and fermium , Wikipedia notes that: Einsteinium and fermium did occur naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so. \n The source of that claim? Emsley’s book. I really need to get my hands on a copy. \n In fact, the Wikipedia articles kinda contradict themselves (I think). They say that einsteinium and fermium did occur in the Oklo reactor at some point, but each article also states that: Synthesis of einsteinium/fermium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust (sic) requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. \n So, how far does neutron capture get you in nature? As far as fermium or not past plutonium? \n I’ve kinda had this debate before (see here and here ), but it was focused more on the number of naturally occurring elements, not the heaviest. Looking back at those posts does remind me to point out this link that states: All six of these elements (93-98)", "parametric_answer": "osmium", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

It has since been revived for Channel 5 from 13 October 2008 to 20 March 2009. \n Background \n 1987-96 \n Going for Gold was originally broadcast on BBC1 from 12 October 1987 to 9 July 1996, usually, after the lunchtime broadcast of Australian soap opera Neighbours. It was presented by Irish broadcaster Henry Kelly, and its defining concept was that it featured contestants from different European countries who competed against each other to answer questions (all in English) to win a prize. The show was shown on BBC1 in the UK and on Super Channel (later NBC Super Channel) in Continental Europe and on BBC TV Europe (which carried a mix of BBC1 and BBC2 output up to its dissolution in early 1991). \n The 1987–1996 run of the quiz show each week had seven contestants that spoke English (each representing a different European country) who would compete against each other for a place in the finals. The show followed a repechage format (now common, but then, unusual), whereby unsuccessful contestants from Monday's show would return on Tuesday, and so on throughout the week. Each episode lasted for 25 minutes, including four rounds. \n There were ten series in total (two in 1992). The first five series were broadcast during the winter, and many of these were split in half by the Christmas break. The (second) 1992 and 1993 series went out in the autumn, the last three were broadcast during the summer. The 1996 series featured competitors from the United Kingdom only. \n 2008-09 \n The show was revived and produced by talkbackTHAMES and aired on Channel 5, premiering from 13 October to 19 December 2008. The new version featured only contestants from the UK and Ireland, was broadcast live and hosted by newsreader John Suchet. Former ITV Play host Alex Kramer, did the newly introduced viewers' phone-in question section from 17 November 2008 until 20 March 2009, repeating the questions several times and talking to the selected phone-in contestant. The set questions involve many clues to an item or person, and the phone-ins were notorious for taking up significant amounts of time during the show.  \n The show continued its run between 5 January and 20 March 2009. Vicky Letch temporarily replaced Alex Kramer as the viewer's phone-in host whilst Alex was on holiday. When John Suchet was unavailable, the programme was hosted by Dean Wilson. At the end of the series, the sixteen winners with the most daily wins contested four semi-finals, the winners of which competed in the series final on 20 March 2009, won by Iwan Thomas. \n Format \n Elimination round (Round 1) \n Each edition began with a short general knowledge round to all seven contestants. Out of the contestants who started the show, four would go through to the next round (always referred to as the \"first round proper\" by Kelly). These four would be the first who managed to answer each of the four general knowledge questions correctly. These questions would usually take the form of a 20 to 30-second description of an object, person, animal or place (usually beginning \"Who am I?\", \"What am I?\", etc.), with progressively more details being revealed by Kelly until someone was able to identify it. By the Thursday show, there would be only four contestants left to play the opening round and so several questions were asked and the first person to two points would join the previous days' winners in \"the first round proper\". \n This round was not played in the 2008 version. \n Beat the Buzzer (Round 2) \n The Beat the Buzzer round was a general knowledge round, played with hands on plungers. Questions were worth one, two or three points. A contestant who gave a correct answer would be told the subject of the next question, and got to choose the value of that question.

Studies have shown that walkable urban areas are healthier, wealthier and safer (perhaps in part because wealthy people can afford to live in nicer places)—and anyway, who doesn’t want to go outside every once in a while? \n If getting around without a car appeals, you should head to New York City or San Francisco (if you can afford either). That’s according to a new ranking of the most walkable large US cities by Redfin, a real estate analysis website and brokerage. \n The site uses something it calls Walk Score, an algorithm to measure how convenient it is to do daily errands without wheels, on a 100-point scale. It doesn’t take into account public transit systems (there’s a different score for that), but looks at things like the walking distance to schools, restaurants, and grocery stores, from any given point. \n “It’s a population-rated average, sampled at every block,” explains Matt Lerner, VP of products at Redfin. “We’re basically sampling the walk score for every block in the city, weighted by the number of people who live there.” Cities are scored by where the population is, and aren’t penalized for non-walkable areas like shipping ports, industrial districts, and airports. \n Most of the cities in the Redfin top 10 are unsurprising. NYC, San Francisco, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Washington D.C. all got big before the automobile age, so they were made for moving on foot. But the top scores for Miami, Oakland, and Seattle point to the fact that history isn’t all that matters. Cities can change to cater to pedestrians instead of, or at least in addition to, cars. \n Lots of cities have become more pedestrian-friendly since Redfin’s last rankings, in 2011. Four years ago, New York City and San Francisco had basically the same score (about 85). Now, the Big Apple’s several points up, thanks to pro-walking efforts like booting cars out of Times Square, Lerner says. \n Detroit didn’t crack the top ten, but its score went up 2.2 points, to 52.2, in part thanks to the downtown arrival of big companies like Quicken Loans, bringing restaurants, shops, and businesses with them. New Orleans’ score rose nearly a point, as it develops more affordable housing and revitalizes commercial districts in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Miami has seen a surge of development, with new mixed-use commercial and residential areas opening up in the past few years. So there’s good news for pedestrians all over the country. \n If you’re only interested in a top 10 walkable city, here’s who came out on top: \n New York: 87.6", "parametric_answer": "seattle", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

You see the “highest capital in Europe” claim everywhere, including city tours , travel websites and even the second edition of “City Guide Madrid” by Blue Guides. \n A friend who just came back from hiking in Andorra , however, told me that’s not true. Andorra’s capital, Andorra la Vella , stands at 1,023 meters (3,356 feet) and takes the prize for highest European capital. While its population is only a bit over 22,000 and the city governs one of the smallest countries in Europe, size doesn’t matter in this contest. \n Andorra la Vella is nestled in the Pyrenees Mountains between Spain and France. My friend tells me there are numerous day hikes from town that take you into spectacular valleys and peaks past alpine streams and waterfalls. The winter ski season is justly famous. The city is pretty cheap too. Sounds like I’ll have to do an Andorran series sometime soon. \n Defenders of Madrid can nitpick, though. Andorra is a co-principality and you could make the case that it isn’t a fully independent country. The President of France and the Bishop of Urgell in Spain act as co-princes. Like other European monarchs, however, they don’t have much power in the day-to-day running of the country. Andorra is a parliamentary democracy with an elected Prime Minister. Andorra has all the other trappings of nationhood as well, such as a flag, diplomats and membership to important international bodies such as the EU and UN.

A few weeks ago, the night before our last show, Malcolm Turnbull challenged Tony Abbott for the leadership of the Liberal Party and therefore the whole country. At the time we managed to give you a quick update to let you know that it'd happened. But now we're back I think it's time to give you the full story. So who is Malcolm Turnbull and how might things change on his watch? Here's Carl. \n He's rocked a magazine cover, a leather jacket, a sleeping bag, and plenty of hi-vis vests. Now he's rocking a new title - the Prime Minister of Australia! But how did this guy, Malcolm Turnbull, become our 29th PM? Well let's begin right at the start. \n Malcolm was born in Sydney. He went to Sydney Grammar School as a kid, then later Sydney Uni. From there he won a scholarship to the famous Oxford University in England. He's been a journalist, a well-known lawyer, and a super successful businessman worth more than one hundred million bucks! \n In the nineties he led a group that wanted Australia to become a republic and ditch the Queen as our head of state. That's when he came up against this familiar face - now former PM Tony Abbott. \n In 2004 Mr Turnbull was elected as a Liberal member of parliament. He quickly rose through the ranks, and it might surprise you to hear he was actually the leader of the Liberal party once before, back in 2008-2009 when they weren't in government. But some of his colleagues didn't agree with his views on things like climate change. \n MALCOLM TURNBULL: This is about the future of our planet. \n And in a very narrow vote he lost the job to Tony Abbott who later became PM. \n Afterwards Malcolm Turnbull stayed on in politics and eventually became Communications Minister on Tony Abbott's team. But he wasn't happy with the way Mr Abbott was running the country. \n MALCOLM TURNBULL: Ultimately, the Prime Minister has not been capable of providing the economic leadership our nation needs. \n In Australia, political parties choose their own leaders. So Malcolm Turnbull asked the PM for a vote and then it was up to all of the members of the Liberal Party to decide who would lead them, and therefore the whole country! \n In the end 44 members wanted to keep Tony Abbott while 54 voted for Malcolm Turnbull, that meant he became making him Australia's fifth Prime Minister in just five years! But our new PM reckons his government will be different to the last one. \n MALCOLM TURNBULL: We are going to make the decisions carefully, consultatively, and listening - not just talking to listening to - as many people as we can. \n And already that's led to the Government scrapping their policy on how to fund universities. But the biggest change so far has been to the Government's ministry, the team who will help Turnbull govern the country. \n It now has more women, Australia's first indigenous frontbencher Ken Wyatt, and more young politicians, including the youngest ever federal minister 25 year old Wyatt Roy! \n So far Malcolm Turnbull's already proven to be pretty popular, swinging opinion polls back into the government's favour. But many say it's too soon to tell just how much of a change our 29th PM will bring to Australia's parliament.

Of his albums, 12 are gold and four are platinum, and in the mid-'70s he had a string of gold singles. \n Denver was raised in an Air Force family and lived in various Southern and Southwestern towns. In his early teens his grandmother gave him a 1910 Gibson acoustic guitar. He enrolled at Texas Tech in 1961, majoring in architecture and playing in local clubs. In 1964 he dropped out of college and moved to L.A., and after he adopted Denver as his stage name, he replaced Chad Mitchell in the Chad Mitchell Trio in 1965. The Trio, a major draw on the early-'60s hootenanny circuit, was $40,000 in debt upon Denver's arrival, which he later helped it pay back. The group recorded for Mercury (which later repackaged the results under Denver's name as Beginnings) and toured widely. At a 1966 Trio concert at Gustavus Adolphus College in Minnesota, Denver met sophomore Ann Martell, who married him the next year (they would divorce in 1983). \n Rhymes and Reasons included \"Leaving on a Jet Plane,\" a #1 hit that year for Peter, Paul and Mary; Denver shared their producer, Milt Okun. His own rise began with the million-selling \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" (#2, 1971). After he had moved to Aspen, Colorado, Rocky Mountain High sold over a million copies. The #1 \"Annie's Song\" (written for his wife) and \"Sunshine on My Shoulders,\" plus \"Back Home Again\" (#5) made Denver the best-selling pop musician of 1974. Greatest Hits sold over 10 million copies worldwide and stayed in the Top 100 for two years. The governor of Colorado proclaimed John Denver the state's poet laureate. \n While the hits continued —\"Thank God I'm a Country Boy\" (#1, 1975), \"I'm Sorry\" (#1, 1975) —Denver tried TV and film appearances, with variety specials, dramatic roles, and a screen debut costarring with George Burns in 1977's Oh, God! He started Windsong Records (distributed by RCA) in 1976, and signed the Starland Vocal Band (\"Afternoon Delight,\" #1, 1976), whose Bill and Taffy Danoff had written \"Take Me Home . . .\" with him. \n Denver did volunteer work for ecological causes, the ERA, and space exploration (he was a board member of the National Space Institute) and against nuclear power. In 1984 he made the first of several tours of the thenPSoviet Union; he recorded a special version of \"Let Us Begin (What Are We Making Weapons For?),\" from One World, in Moscow with Soviet singer Alexandre Gradsky. In 1987 he returned to the USSR, where he performed a benefit concert for victims of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster. \n From the mid-'80s until his death in 1997, Denver never regained a commercial foothold (1985's Dreamland Express reached only #90, 1990's The Flower That Shattered the Stone, only #185); he had a brief return to prominence in late summer 1993, when he was arrested for drunk driving in Aspen, Colorado. The following year he was arrested on similar charges. A second marriage ended in divorce in 1991. As his musical career waned, Denver devoted more attention to humanitarian causes and his first love, flying. In 1993 Denver became the first nonclassical musician given the Albert Schweitzer Music Award, for lifetime humanitarianism. In 1994 he published Take Me Home: An Autobiography. A pilot for over 20 years, Denver died on October 12, 1997, when the experimental plane he was flying suddenly dove into Monterey Bay, killing him instantly. After his death, some of those close to him revealed that Denver had suffered bouts of depression and insecurity throughout his life.

They never fully embraced rock and roll, but their breezy harmonies influenced many of the stars who followed them, including The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Simon and Garfunkel, and The Byrds — groups whose popularity started to take off as that of the Everlys waned. \n As they were overtaken by new musical fashions from the early 1960s onwards, The Everly Brothers continued to perform and record until 1973, when their relationship fractured publicly during a concert in California. \n Phillip Everly was born in Chicago on January 19 1939, the son of Ike and Margaret Everly, who had a popular country singing act in the 1940s. He was almost exactly two years younger than his brother Don, but the boys’ parents brought them up as though they were twins. They shared birthday parties, and were dressed in the same clothes — Don was not allowed to have a sports jacket until Phil was old enough to have one too. \n Related Articles \n Felice Bryant \n 24 Apr 2003 \n Both boys attended high school at Shenandoah, Iowa, where their parents had a radio breakfast show, on which Don and Phil sang from childhood. After the family had moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, the brothers met the guitarist and producer Chet Atkins and other figures on the local music scene. They were briefly signed up to Columbia, for which they made their first record, Keep a-Lovin’ Me, which was released in February 1956 but made little impact. \n It was when The Everly Brothers were taken up by the Cadence record label that their careers began to take off. In 1957 they recorded Felice and Boudleaux Bryant’s Bye Bye Love, on which Phil and Don played guitars alongside Chet Atkins and the Nashville session musician Ray Edenton. The song was an immediate hit, and established the brothers as the first successful pop act to come out of Nashville. Don and Phil bought a new Oldsmobile on the proceeds and embarked on a tour with Johnny Cash. They began sporting matching suits, and their growing army of fans had difficulty telling them apart (Don’s hair was darker, and his the deeper voice). \n They followed this success in the same year with Wake Up Little Susie; This Little Girl of Mine; All I Have to Do Is Dream; and Claudette. Bird Dog and Devoted to You were released in 1958, and by now they were one of the most famous pop acts in the United States, as well known as Elvis Presley, Pat Boone and Ricky Nelson. They became close to Buddy Holly, who originally wrote his song Not Fade Away for The Everly Brothers — they suggested that he record it himself. \n After the release of Let It Be Me in 1959, the Everlys moved to Warner Bros Records. Cathy’s Clown, written by Don, remained at No 1 in America for five weeks in 1959 and topped the British charts for seven, selling more than eight million copies worldwide. On the back of its success Cadence delved into its archive to release When Will I Be Loved, which reached No 8 in the US and No 4 in Britain. \n If the Everlys’ star burned bright, it also burned quickly, thanks to rapidly changing musical tastes in the Sixties.

{"question": "What do we call the selfless and virtuous practice of concern for the welfare of others?", "answers": ["selflessly"], "context": "The 6 Paramitas | Dharmamind Buddhist GroupThe 6 Paramitas | Dharmamind Buddhist Group \n Vault \n The 6 Paramitas \n The Sanskrit word paramita means to cross over to the other shore. Paramita may also be translated as perfection, perfect realisation, or reaching beyond limitation. Through the practice of these six paramitas, we cross over the sea of suffering (samsara) to the shore of happiness and awakening (nirvana); we cross over from ignorance and delusion to enlightenment. Each of the six paramitas is an enlightened quality of the heart, a glorious virtue or attribute – the innate seed of perfect realisation within us. The paramitas are the very essence of our true nature. However, since these enlightened qualities of the heart have become obscured by delusion, selfishness, and other karmic tendencies, we must develop these potential qualities and bring them into expression. In this way, the six paramitas are an inner cultivation, a daily practice for wise, compassionate, loving, and enlightened living. The paramitas are the six kinds of virtuous practice required for skilfully serving the welfare of others and for the attainment of enlightenment. We must understand that bringing these virtuous qualities of our true nature into expression requires discipline, practice, and sincere cultivation. This is the path of the Bodhisattva – one who is dedicated to serving the highest welfare of all living beings with the awakened heart of unconditional love, skilful wisdom, and all-embracing compassion. \n 1. The Perfection of Giving (Dana Paramita) \n This paramita is the enlightened quality of generosity, charity, giving, and offering. The essence of this paramita is a boundless openness of heart and mind, a selfless generosity and giving which is completely free from attachment and expectation. From the depths of our heart, we practice generously offering compassion, time, energy, and resources to serve the welfare of all beings. Giving is one of the essential preliminary steps of our practice. Our giving should always be unconditional and selfless; completely free of any selfish desire for gratitude, recognition, advantage, reputation, or any wordly reward. The perfection of generosity is not accomplished simply by the action of giving, nor by the actual gift itself. Rather, the true essence of this paramita is our pure motivation of genuine concern for others – the truly generous motivation of the awakened heart of compassion, wisdom, and love. In addition, our practice of giving should be free of discrimination regarding who is worthy and who is unworthy to receive. To cultivate the paramita of generosity, it is wise to contemplate the enormous benefits of this practice, the disadvantages of being miserly, as well as the obvious fact that our body and our wealth are impermanent. With this in mind, we will certainly be encouraged to use both our body and wealth to practice generosity while we still have them. Generosity is a cure for the afflictions of greed, miserliness, and possessiveness. In this practice of giving, we may offer our time, energy, money, food, clothing, or gifts so as to assist others. To the best of our ability, we may offer the priceless treasure of Dharma instruction, giving explanations on the Buddha’s teaching. This offering serves to free others from misperceptions that cause confusion, pain, and suffering. We can offer fearless giving and protection by delivering living beings (insects, animals, and people) from harm, distress, fear, and terror. In this way, we offer care and comfort, helping others to feel safe and peaceful. We do this selflessly, without counting the cost to ourselves. We practice the perfection of generosity in an especially powerful way when we embrace all living being continually in the radiant love of our heart. \n 2. The Perfection of Ethics (Sila Paramita) \n This paramita is the enlightened quality of virtuous and ethical behaviour, morality, self-discipline, impeccability, personal integrity, honour, and harmlessness. The essence of this paramita is that through our love and compassion we do not harm others; we are virtuous and harmless in our thoughts, speech and actions. This practice of ethical conduct is the very foundation for progressing in any practice of meditation and", "parametric_answer": "altruism", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}
{"question": "What term is used when a clot forms in a blood vessel?", "answers": ["thrombotic", "thromboembolism", "thrombosis"], "context": "World Thrombosis Day | Key TermsWorld Thrombosis Day | Key Terms \n VTE Protocol \n Arterial thrombosis - A blood clot that develops in an artery. A clot in a coronary artery blocks blood flow to the heart and is the underlying cause of most heart attacks. A clot that blocks blood flow in an artery in the brain is a major cause of strokes. \n Anticoagulant medication - Sometimes called blood thinners; anticoagulants are used to stop the formation of blood clots, thereby reducing the risk of clots in the leg or lungs, strokes and other dangerous events. Examples include: heparin, warfarin, enoxaparin and newer drugs such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban. \n Atherosclerosis - A disorder caused by a buildup of plaque (a waxy substance containing fat and cholesterol) on the inner walls of large arteries. This narrows the artery and slows the flow of blood. Atherosclerosis/plaques are the underlying process on which thrombosis can take place if ruptured. \n Atrial fibrillation - An irregular and often rapid heartbeat that can lead to clot formation in a chamber of the heart. In atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers called the atria beat irregularly and out of synch with the lower chambers. Atrial fibrillation can cause a stroke if the clot breaks free and travels to the brain. \n Blood clot - A thick mass of blood cells, platelets and fibrin. Clotting is a natural process to stem the flow of blood from damaged blood vessels. \n Blood vessels - Include (1) arteries, which carry blood from the heart to the brain, limbs and organs; (2) veins, which carry blood from the limbs and body organs toward the heart; and (3) capillaries, very small vessels that connect the two. \n Cardiovascular disease - Any disease affecting the heart or the circulatory system. \n Clotting - The process in which liquid blood becomes a solid mass (called a thrombus). Clotting is also called coagulation. This process is important to prevent excessive bleeding when a blood vessel is injured (such as when you cut yourself). However, the process can be harmful when clots form inside the vessel and block the flow of blood. \n Clotting factors - A group of proteins (sometimes called “factors”) in the blood that works together to cause blood clotting. \n Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - A blood clot that forms in the veins located deep within a limb, usually the lower leg or thigh. By blocking the flow of blood back to the heart, these clots are often characterized by pain and swelling of the leg. Clots in the leg can break off, travel to the lungs and lodge there as pulmonary embolism (PE). These can be fatal because they block the flow of blood from the lungs back into the heart. \n D-dimer - A molecule released from the breakdown of clot; raised levels may indicate a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), but levels are also raised in many other conditions. Measurement of D-dimer is useful to doctors in helping rule out a diagnosis of DVT or PE. \n Embolus - A mass, usually a detached blood clot, that travels through the bloodstream and the heart and then lodges in an artery, blocking it. \n Factor Xa - Factor Xa converts prothrombin to thrombin, which then converts fibrinogen to fibrin, a blood clot. Anticoagulant drugs known as Xa inhibitors act by inhibiting Factor Xa and preventing the formation of thrombin. \n Fibrin - The protein substance in blood clots; fibrin creates a web-like structure that binds together platelets and red and white blood cells at the site of injury. \n Hemostasis (or Haemostasis) - Hemostasis is a physiological process that maintains blood in a fluid state normally and prevents excessive bleeding from damaged vessels. Because hemostasis has to keep blood fluid in the vessel and form clots when the vessel is damaged – two opposing roles – it is very complicated.

The vast majority of people who make up the population of Canada       live in the southern part of the country, near the American border,       leaving the northern areas largely uninhabited. \n The       strongest concentrations of population are located, firstly, along the       axis extending from Québec city to Windsor, that is, along the St Lawrence       River and lakes Ontario and Erie, and secondly, in Western Canada, in       Vancouver and Victoria in British       Columbia and the area extending from Calgary to Edmonton in Alberta. \n Figure  35 Population  density by dissemination area (DA) in Canada, 2006 \n Top of Page \n Ontario should  remain the most populous province \n In       2006, Canada's       population was very largely concentrated in four provinces: Ontario,        Quebec, British         Columbia and Alberta.       Approximately 86% of Canadians in 2006 were living in one of these four       provinces. The 12.7 million Ontarians alone account for nearly 40% of       Canadians. \n The       population projected for 2031, under the six scenarios used for the most       recent population projections, shows that in most cases, the population of       the provinces and territories should be larger in 2031 than in 2006. Only       three provinces and one territory—Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick,       Saskatchewan and Yukon—are likely to have a       smaller population in 2031 than in 2006, and this is under certain       scenarios only. Thus, growth is       expected everywhere else. \n Figure  36 Population of  the Canadian provinces and territories in 2006 and 2031 \n Top of Page \n The drop in fertility has affected almost all provinces and  territories in the past 25 years \n In       2005, Northwest Territories       and Nunavut had the highest       fertility levels in Canada       with 2.11 and 2.72 children per woman. This situation is attributable to       the presence of a large Aboriginal population. Similarly, the high       fertility of the three Prairie provinces,       compared to other provinces, is largely due to their Aboriginal       population. The lowest fertility levels were registered in Newfoundland       and Labrador, British Columbia,       New Brunswick and Nova         Scotia, with total fertility rates of       respectively 1.34, 1.39, 1.41 and 1.40 children per woman. Quebec,        Ontario,  Prince         Edward Island and the Yukon, on the other hand, had a       fertility rate close to the national average (1.54 children per woman). \n Between       1981 and 2005, fertility levels declined in almost every province and       territory. The largest drops occurred in the territories (Yukon       and Northwest Territories)       and Prince Edward Island. Manitoba       is the only province in which fertility       has not declined since 1981. \n Table  1 Total fertility rate in Canada, provinces and  territories, 1981 and 2005 \n Top of Page \n An increase in life expectancy in all provinces \n As in Canada as a whole,       life expectancy observed in all provinces has been rising since 1971, for       both males and females. \n British         Columbia is the province which, in 2004,       had the highest life expectancy with 78.5 years for males and 83.1 for       females.

It's also the only state to border only one other state — New Hampshire. No one is really sure where Maine's name came from. Some surmise that it was named after an ancient French province — the Province of Maine; others believe it was a derivation of the world \"mainland.\" The word \"Maine\" was first officially used in 1665 in a request by the King's Commissioners that \"The Province of Maine\" be used in official documents. \n More Syllabic Facts: \n Only five countries in the world have one syllable: Chad, France, Spain, Greece, Laos, though Wales might make six depending on how you pronounce it (Way-als). \n The most syllables in a state's name is five.

Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside.  State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). \n States range in population from just under 600,000 (Wyoming) to over 38 million (California), and in area from  (Rhode Island) to  (Alaska). Four states use the term commonwealth rather than state in their full official names. \n States are divided into counties or county-equivalents, which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign. County or county-equivalent structure varies widely by state. State governments are allocated power by the people (of each respective state) through their individual constitutions. All are grounded in republican principles, and each provides for a government, consisting of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.  \n States possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution; among them ratifying constitutional amendments. Historically, the tasks of local law enforcement, public education, public health, regulating intrastate commerce, and local transportation and infrastructure have generally been considered primarily state responsibilities, although all of these now have significant federal funding and regulation as well. Over time, the U.S. Constitution has been amended, and the interpretation and application of its provisions have changed. The general tendency has been toward centralization and incorporation, with the federal government playing a much larger role than it once did. There is a continuing debate over states' rights, which concerns the extent and nature of the states' powers and sovereignty in relation to the federal government and the rights of individuals. \n States and their residents are represented in the federal Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state is represented by two Senators, and at least one Representative, while additional representatives are distributed among the states in proportion to the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census.  Each state is also entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College, the body that elects the President of the United States, equal to the total of Representatives and Senators from that state.  \n The Constitution grants to Congress  the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50. Alaska and Hawaii are the most recent states admitted, both in 1959. \n The Constitution is silent on the question of whether states have the power to secede (withdraw from) from the Union.

He's assembled his thoughts in a book called The Bush Tragedy, which Time magazine political columnist Joe Klein calls a \"scorching, powerful and entirely plausible account\" of an administration whose \"epic collapse\" Klein has lately been writing about. \n Weisberg says the book isn't intended as an indictment. \"What I've tried to do,\" he explained at the outset of a recent online chat at washingtonpost.com, \"is provide an early historical perspective on George W. Bush. Instead of arguing, as so many have, that he is a bad president, I largely assume that he has failed as president, and ask the more interesting question of why.\" \n Weisberg studied the president with an eye toward his relationships with his family, his advisors and his religion, and concluded that Bush's relationship with his father is at the core of his presidency and its failures. \n NPR thanks our sponsors \n January 24, 200811:27 AM ET \n Jacob Weisberg \n The Bushes and the Walkers \n O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye \n Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons, \n From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame, \n Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd \n Which art possess'd now to depose thyself. \n —RICHARD II \n GEORGE WALKER BUSH IS THE PRODUCT OF TWO FAMILY TRADITIONS, the Bushes and the Walkers. On one side is the familiar patriarch Prescott Bush (1895–1972), the decorous Republican senator from Connecticut, the New England WASP, the pennant-waving Yale man. On the other side of his father's family stands a lesser-known patriarch, George Herbert Walker (1875–1953), the St. Louis buccaneer and raucous playboy. \n The Bushes as we know them today are the product of a combination of—one might say the combustion between—the two very different families arrayed around these two dominant men. Because the family is private to the point of being obsessively secretive, its basic internal struggle has been largely obscured in favor of a familiar cliché: the old American upper class. But this isn't the story of a happy, unified family. Drilling into the history of the Walkers and the Bushes, one hits layer upon sedimentary layer of conflict among brothers, cousins, uncles, and grandparents. The buried drama and forgotten ancestors are the beginning point for understanding George W. Bush, the roots of whose temperament are not as shallow as they appear. \n Superficially, the Walkers and Bushes had much in common when they came together just after the First World War. Both families represented industrial fortunes from the Midwest transplanted into East Coast finance. Both were fanatical about sports and ferociously competitive, sharing a passion for baseball, golf, and tennis. Both came to worship side by side at Christ Church in Greenwich, Connecticut, and at St. Ann's in Kennebunkport, Maine, where George H. W. Bush's parents, Prescott Bush and Dorothy Walker (1901–1992), were married in 1921. Endless connections to Yale, Skull and Bones, and the Harriman banking enterprises run through both families. \n Yet an enormous amount is papered over by the simplification that George H. W. Bush was raised a Connecticut Yankee. The union of Prescott Bush and Dorothy Walker represented less a merger of equals than a crossing of lines: old fortune and new, Protestant and Catholic, Republican and Democrat.

{"question": "\"\"\"The Great Gate of Kiev\"\" and \"\"Catacombs\"\" are two sections of which musical work by Mussorgsky?\"", "answers": ["great gate of kiev"], "context": "Modest Mussorgsky - Pictures at an Exhibition (album ...Modest Mussorgsky - Pictures at an Exhibition (album review ) | Sputnikmusic \n Modest Mussorgsky \n May 29th, 2006 | 19 replies \n Release Date: 1874 | Tracklist \n When asked to name a Russian composer from the Romantic Period of Classical music, most people today would frown. For the few that could exert their knowledge on the subject, most would only be able to name Pyotr Tchaikovsky. Yet behind Tchaikovsky lurks a wealth of passion, brilliance and creativity. Although it would be hard to signal any men out from such a prodigious crowd, Modest Mussorgsky took his own approach to the music, and created a small collection of greatness. \n Mussorgsky was part of a group of Russian nationalist composers known as 'The Mighty Five.' Yet unlike many of his contemporaries, Mussorgsky did not try and follow the path laid out by so many composers before him. Mussorgsky attempted to create his own sound of raw power, emotion and beauty that was influenced greatly by Russian folk music, foreign composers and Russian church music. Although he only composed part-time, and left behind a small collection of works, Mussorgsky's work visibly progressed then declined. He gradually opted for more of a sense of realism in his music, portraying subjects in their full imperfect form. Before his steep decline into the murky waters of alcoholism, Mussorgsky composed one of his finest works, the innovative piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition. \n Although stunning in its own right, Mussorgsky's piano composition is outshined in some areas by Maurice Ravels orchestral version of Pictures at an Exhibition, that enhanced the intensity and passion of the music. Pictures at an Exhibition was a tribute to Mussorgsky's friend Viktor Hartmann, a Russian artist and architect. Yet rather than just opting for a simple tribute, Pictures at an Exhibition is an imaginary musical tour through a collection of Hartmann's drawings and watercolours. The structure of the suite showcases Mussorgsky at his most innovative, composing the album as if it was an actual walk through the exhibition. Each Promenade (leisurely walk) between pictures takes on a different form and emotion, creating a natural flow between pictures. Yet even more noteworthy is the way that Mussorgsky merges the Promenade into two of the movements, Cum mortuis in lingua mortua and The Great Gate of Kiev, sounding enigmatic in Cum mortuis in lingua mortua and nationalistic in The Great Gate of Kiev. \n Each of the 10 pieces represented by Mussorgsky takes on their own unique form, ranging from the mysterious, to the patriotic and even to haunting darkness. Some of the artworks portrayed have been lost or destroyed, yet Mussorgsky's musical representations clearly portray what the paintings may have looked like. For such a subjective art form, Mussorgsky's music focuses in on the essence of each painting, capturing their spirit into 30 minutes of musical brilliance. With each note Mussorgsky recreates a stroke of the brush, every note falling into place to paint each striking picture. \n Mussorgsky's ability to imagine the sounds of each painting shines through in The Old Castle, where the sombre Alto-Saxophone defines the path of the song. The mood is not altogether outcast; the powerful backbone of the castle is portrayed through a deep and weighty double bass. Yet emptiness takes over the song, bringing forth thoughts of a lifeless and emotionless medieval castle. Bydlo is equally downcast at first. Although the interpretations of the opening bars vary (some begin very loudly, and others softly), the rhythmic percussion section sets an unconstricting marching tone. After fluttering string instruments overtake the pounding march, the rhythm becomes increasingly overpowering, in a state of booming fortissimo. But down the pressure goes, as the marching object soon continues on into the distance. \n Pictures at an Exhibition is not a one trick pony however, and offers melodramatic happiness in equal quantities. Tuileries and Ballet of the Unhatched Chicks are both heavily excitable, prancing around in a flurry of flutes and strings. Mussorgsky does not quite capture their radiant beauty as well as he captures power, truth and lack of it. Equally energetic is The Market Place at Limoges, which buzzes along like a real market place", "parametric_answer": "pictures at exhibition", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

Source: Press photo \n Cast adrift by the  collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia’s competitive sailors have spent the past  two decades trying to resurrect a tradition of nautical success. Now they could  finally have the wind in their sails. \n Russia’s sailing history  goes back to one man, Peter the Great, who travelled Europe to find ways to  modernise the country. \n Timeline: \n • 1697 Peter the Great visits the Netherlands to learn the art of shipbuilding. \n • 1912 Russia wins its first sailing medal with a bronze at the Stockholm Olympics. \n • 1980 The Moscow Olympics holds the sailing event off Tallinn, which is now Estonia’s capital. \n From the start, sailing  was a major focus of Peter’s efforts as he tried to create the first real  Russian navy and base it in his newly created capital of St Petersburg, on the  formerly Swedish-ruled Baltic coast he had conquered. \n In 1698, he visited  Deptford Dockyard in south-east London incognito to learn shipbuilding  techniques and even served an apprenticeship with Dutch boatbuilders, learning  the skills to pass on to his subjects. Even now, Russian nautical terms such as  matros (seaman) and grot (mainsail) come from the Dutch language. \n That tradition was still  going strong in 1912, when a team of Russians and Germans from St Petersburg  won a bronze medal at the Stockholm Olympics. Their world as gentleman yachting  enthusiasts was swept away by the Russian Revolution five years later, but the  seeds of a competitive sailing tradition had been sown. \n Stalinist repression and  the Second World War meant that yacht clubs were hardly a priority in the  decades that followed, before Muscovites Timir Pinegin and Fyodor Shutkov won  the first Olympic sailing medal for the Soviet Union in 1960, sailing their  boat Tornado to gold in Naples at the Rome Games. \n Synergy leads Russia’s pro yachtsmen to new achievements \n The Soviet Union was a  respectable mid-level power in world sailing, amassing a further 11 medals  before the country collapsed in 1991. Soviet-trained sailing veterans won newly  independent Russia a couple more Olympic medals, but the last of them came in  1996, just as geography started to bite. \n Russia has a lot of  coastline but much of it is frozen, home to military installations or otherwise  unsuitable for sailing. Tallinn, which hosted the Olympic sailing when the  Soviet Union staged the Moscow Olympics of 1980, was now the capital of  independent Estonia, while Ukraine retained a strong talent pool of sailors in  the post-Soviet world. \n Russia was left isolated,  Peter the Great’s ship becalmed, as sailing developed and other nations sped  ahead. \n “Our sailors have been  left on the sidelines by the rapid development of professional sailing, which  can now be observed all over the world,” is the bald admission in the mission  statement of one government-backed sailing project. “In the world sailing  market we’re basically not converting the serious potential of Russian sailors,  based on decades of successful Olympic experience.” \n Yachting on a budget: best Russian route for Frugal Mariners \n However, there are now  signs that the wind may be changing. The project quoted above is the Gazprom  Youth Sailing Challenge, which combines the wealth of Russia’s state gas  company with the expertise and traditions of the St Petersburg Yacht Club to  help train a new generation of competitive sailors. The numbers involved are  small – no more than a few dozen – but the project has done well to find talent  from all over", "parametric_answer": "finland", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}
{"question": "What is the equivalent Royal Navy rank to an Air Marshall in the R.A.F.?", "answers": ["vice-admiral", "vice admiral"], "context": "Air marshalAir marshal (Air Mshl or AM) is a three-star  air-officer rank which originated in and continues to be used by the Royal Air Force. The rank is also used by the air forces of many countries which have historical British influence and it is sometimes used as the English translation of an equivalent rank in countries which have a non-English air force-specific rank structure. \n Air marshal is a three-star rank and has a NATO ranking code of OF-8, equivalent to a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy or a lieutenant-general in the British Army or the Royal Marines. In other NATO forces, such as the United States Armed Forces and the Canadian Armed Forces, the equivalent three-star rank is lieutenant general. \n The rank of air marshal is immediately senior to the rank of air vice-marshal and immediately subordinate to the rank of air chief marshal. \n Officers in the rank of air marshal typically hold very senior appointments such as commander-in-chief of an air force or a large air force formation. Officers in the ranks of air chief marshal and air vice-marshal are also referred to generically as air marshals. Occasionally, air force officers of marshal rank are considered to be air marshals. \n Royal Air Force use and history \n Origins \n Prior to the adoption of RAF-specific rank titles in 1919, it was suggested that the RAF might use the Royal Navy's officer ranks, with the word \"air\" inserted before the naval rank title. For example, the rank that later became air marshal would have been air vice-admiral. The Admiralty objected to any use of their rank titles, including this modified form, and so an alternative proposal was put forward: air-officer ranks would be based on the term \"ardian\", which was derived from a combination of the Gaelic words for \"chief\" (ard) and \"bird\" (eun), with the term \"second ardian\" or \"wing ardian\" being used specifically for the rank equivalent to a vice-admiral and lieutenant-general. However, air marshal was preferred and was adopted on 1 August 1919. The rank of air marshal was first used on 11 August 1919 when Sir Hugh Trenchard was promoted to the rank  and it has been used ever since. \n RAF insignia, command flag and star plate \n The rank insignia consists of two narrow light blue bands (each on a slightly wider black band) over a light blue band on a broad black band. This is worn on the lower sleeves of the dress uniform or on  shoulders of the flying suit or working uniform. \n The command flag for an air marshal is defined by the single broad red band running in the centre of the flag. \n The vehicle star plate for an air marshal depicts three white stars (air marshal is equivalent to a three-star rank) on an air force blue background. \n File:File-UK-Air-OF8-mess-insignia.svg|An RAF air marshal's mess sleeve insignia \n File:UK-Air-OF7n9-shoulder.svg|An RAF air marshal's shoulder board \n File:RAF-AM-OF-8.png|An RAF air marshal's sleeve on No. 1 Service Dress Uniform \n Image:UK-Air-OF8-Flag.svg|An RAF air marshal's command flag \n Image:|An RAF air marshal's star plate \n Other air forces \n The rank of air marshal is also used in a number of the air forces in the Commonwealth, including the Bangladesh Air Force, Indian Air Force, Pakistan Air Force, Royal Australian Air Force and Royal New Zealand Air Force.

The set, which came out in 1989,  featured a spirited Cajun-flavored take on the classic tune, which Boyd took to  the top of the Billboard charts in 1952. \n Turns out the song was commissioned by the Neiman Marcus department store chain  to promote its annual Christmas card. Boydï¿½s hit, which the New York Times said  he recorded when ï¿½he was a skinny, red-headed kid of 12,ï¿½ was banned by the  Roman Catholic Church in Boston, its claim being that it mixed sex with  Christmas. Boyd was apparently widely photographed meeting with the Archdiocese  to explain the song! The ban was subsequently lifted the following Christmas,  when the recording again topped the charts. It has since sold over 60 million  copies; to commemorate the first three million, Columbia Records gave Boyd, who  loved horses, a silver mounted saddle. \n Written by British songwriter Tommie Connor, ï¿½I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Clausï¿½  has since been listed among the top 25 Christmas songs, with other noteworthy  covers coming from the likes of the Jackson Five, Twisted Sister, and of course  the Ronettes, whose classic version graced Phil Spectorï¿½s legendary Christmas  album (the Ronettesï¿½ Estelle Bennett, incidentally, died last month). \n The ï¿½Very Special Christmasï¿½ compilations benefited the Special Olympics and  included such major artists as the Madonna, Sting, Bruce Springsteen, the  Pretenders and Bon Joviï¿½all also starring with John on the first set.

He was 70. \n Mr. Boyd, who also was a child actor, died of cancer at a Santa Monica convalescent hospital. \n Three weeks after the yuletide kiss-and-tell was released, the song was number one on the Billboard charts, selling 2 million records in fewer than 10 weeks. Tens of millions of copies of the much-covered song written by Tommie Connors have been sold over the decades, according to the Allmusic Internet database. \n It has been interpreted by artists, including the Jackson Five, John Mellencamp, and Amy Winehouse. Molly Bee was also 13 when she had a hit warbling about the unlikely pair kissing \"underneath the mistletoe last night.\" Bee died last month at 69. \n Although it came to be regarded as a holiday classic, the ditty about a child who can't understand why Mommy is cheating on Daddy with Santa Claus caused controversy in some quarters when the original featuring Mr. Boyd's childish treble was released. \n The Catholic Archdiocese of Boston condemned the song for implying even a tenuous link between sex and the religious holiday, and record stations in several markets banned it.

It                      was the southernmost of three forts on this section of the                      Kent coast guarding a sheltered anchorage in the English Channel                      known as The Downs. The other two forts were Deal Castle which,                      like Walmer Castle, continues as a popular visitor attraction                      and Sandown Castle which, sadly, fell into disrepair and today                      is little more than a few stones on the seafront at north                      Deal. \n The design of Walmer Castle comprises a circular central keep, encased by four outer bastions - one                      of which serves as a gatehouse. It is surrounded by a deep,                      wide moat. In the 18th- and 19th- centuries, the upper levels                      of the outer bastions were modified and apartments added,                      turning the Castle into an elegant home.

The increase in population of Brighton in the late eighteenth century, which transformed it from a small fishing village to a large seaside resort, enhanced the importance of this road, as did the residence there of George IV , as Prince of Wales, who made Brighton a place of fashion. \n When roads were originally classified, the A23 started at Purley Cross. [2] The road north of this section, including Purley Way , which opened to traffic in April 1925, [3] was part of the A22 . The current route north to Westminster Bridge dates from April 1935. [4] \n The A23 in London has frequently been one of the city’s most congested roads. [5] [6] The M23 motorway was originally proposed to run as far north as Streatham , relieving congestion on the route, but the section north of Hooley was never built. At junction 7 of the M25 motorway , signs for the northbound M23 (which terminates a few miles to the north) simply read “Croydon” with no other London destinations marked. \n In July 2000, control of the section of road inside the Greater London boundary was transferred from The Highways Agency to Transport for London .

In 1965 the Commonwealth Secretariat was established in London to organize and coordinate Commonwealth activities. \n Members of the Commonwealth \n (left in 1961; rejoined 1994) \n India \n (left in 1972; rejoined 1989) \n Sri Lanka \n (Tanganyika in 1961; Tanzania in 1964 upon union with Zanzibar [member 1963]) \n Jamaica \n (joined as special member; full member since 1999) \n Swaziland \n (left in 1987; rejoined 1997; suspended 2009) \n Bangladesh \n (joined as special member; full member since 2000) \n Dominica \n Saint Vincent and the Grenadines \n 1979 \n (joined as special member; full member since 1985) \n Vanuatu \n (joined as special member; full member since 1985) \n Saint Kitts and Nevis \n Rwanda \n 2009 \n Historically, the Commonwealth was an evolutionary outgrowth of the British Empire . The traditional British policy of allowing considerable self-government in its colonies led to the existence by the 19th century of several dependent states that were populated to a significant degree by Europeans accustomed to forms of parliamentary rule and that possessed large measures of sovereignty . By 1931 they were recognized as having special status within the empire by the Statute of Westminster , which referred specifically to a “British Commonwealth of Nations.” The rapid growth of nationalism in other parts of the empire from the 1920s produced a long series of grants of independence, beginning with that to India in 1947, and required a redefinition of the Commonwealth. In 1947 India and Pakistan became members of the Commonwealth, the first with chiefly non-European populations. In 1948 Burma ( Myanmar ) became independent and rejected membership. In 1949 India announced its intention to become a republic , which would have required its withdrawal from the Commonwealth under the existing rules, but at a meeting of Commonwealth heads of government in London in April 1949 it was agreed that India could continue its membership if it accepted the British crown as only “the symbol of the free association” of Commonwealth members. That declaration was the first to drop the adjective British, and thereafter the official name of the organization became the Commonwealth of Nations, or simply the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth was also beset by other difficulties, some members opting to withdraw from the organization, as did Ireland (1949), South Africa (1961), and Pakistan (1972), though both South Africa and Pakistan eventually rejoined (the former in 1994 and the latter in 1989). Commonwealth membership grew dramatically in the second half of the 20th century as former dependencies attained sovereignty . Most of the dependent states granted independence chose Commonwealth membership, and the organization has even grown to include Mozambique (joined 1995), which was the first country granted entry that was never part of the British Empire or under the control of any member. \n Similar Topics \n North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) \n The Commonwealth differs from other international bodies. It has no formal constitution or bylaws. The members have no legal or formal obligation to one another; they are held together by shared traditions, institutions, and experiences as well as by economic self-interest. Commonwealth action is based upon consultation between members, which is conducted through correspondence and through conversations in meetings. Each member country sends an emissary, called a high commissioner, to the capitals of the other members. A Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting is held every two years. At the meeting in Singapore in 1971, members adopted a declaration that restated the Commonwealth’s voluntary and cooperative nature and committed the organization to promoting international peace, fighting racism, opposing colonial domination, and reducing inequities in wealth.

Those sensibilities extend to everyone under the House of Windsor, including Prince William and his newest child, Charlotte Elizabeth Diana. \n According to Carolyn Durand and Michael Rothman of ABC News , the royal baby's official title will be Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Cambridge. She is now fourth in line to the throne behind Prince Charles, William and George. \n \"The naming of the second royal baby is similar in time frame to when the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose George Alexander Louis for their first child,\" Durand and Rothman wrote. \"George was born on July 22 and his name was released a little more than a day later.\" \n ABC News elaborated on the naming process behind the Duke of Cambridge, whose full name is William Arthur Philip Louis. His brother, Prince Harry, had his name announced on the day he was born, an exception to the traditional royal naming process. \n \"When William was born on June 21, 1982, his parents didn't reveal his name until one week later,\" Durand and Rothman wrote. \"William's father, Prince Charles, was a month old before his name was made public.\" \n According to the British Monarchy official website, before 1917, members of the British Royal Family had no surname, but only the name of the house or dynasty to which they belonged. For the most part, members of the Royal Family who are entitled to the style and dignity of HRH Prince or Princess do not need a surname.  \n However, if the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge want to include a surname for their children, there are three choices available - Mountbatten-Windsor, Wales or Cambridge. \n In 1917 George V adopted Windsor - after the castle of the same name - as the \"surname\" of his family. \n And then in 1960, The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh combined their surnames to make Mountbatten-Windsor - their direct descendants can use this name but it isn't binding. \n The official last name of Prince William is Mountbatten-Windsor. In his military role, he used Wales, which is taken from his father, as his surname.  \n Andrew Hewitt of The Mirror elaborated on the significance behind the royal baby's name. \n \"The decision of what to call their second child was William and Kate's alone, and the name was chosen simply because they liked it,\" Hewitt wrote. \"Her middle names were chosen in honor of Charlotte's great-grandmother the Queen, and her late grandmother Princess Diana.\" \n Hewitt reported that the royal couple chose to settle on the name Charlotte, the feminine version of Charles, as a nod to the Duke's father, the Prince of Wales. The name also had important historical links within the royal bloodline. \n \"The name has historic royal links having already had a Queen Charlotte and Princess Charlottes - although they were all several hundreds of years ago,\" Hewitt wrote. \n According to Hewitt, Queen Charlotte shunned her Christian name, Sophie, to go by the title; she was married to King George III. She then gave birth to a daughter in 1766 and named her Charlotte, who became known as the Princess Royal. \n \"Charlotte will share a name with a modern-day European princess but as fourth in line to the throne her chances of becoming monarch are better,\" Hewitt wrote, noting that person was 29-year-old Charlotte Marie Pomeline Casiraghi, who is eighth in line to the throne of Monaco. \n When it comes to daily life, however, Hewitt noted that the royal family rarely refers to their surnames. \n \"Day to day, Charlotte will be known as Princess Charlotte of Cambridge,\" Hewitt wrote. \"But", "parametric_answer": "charles", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}
{"question": "Who is the current Australian prime minister ?", "answers": ["julia gillard"], "context": "Prime Minister of AustraliaThe Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia is the head of government in Australia. The individual who holds the office is the most senior Minister of the Crown, the leader of the Cabinet and the chairperson of the National Security Committee. The office is not mentioned in the Constitution of Australia and exists only through an unwritten political convention and tradition. Despite this, in practice it is the most powerful political position in Australia. The individual who holds the office is commissioned by the Governor-General of Australia. \n Almost always and according to convention, the Prime Minister is the leader of the majority party or largest party in a coalition of parties in the House of Representatives. However, there is no constitutional requirement that the prime minister sit in the House of Representatives, or even be a member of parliament, though by convention this is always the case. The only case where a member of the Senate was appointed prime minister was John Gorton, who subsequently resigned his Senate position and was elected as a member of the House of Representatives (Senator George Pearce was acting prime minister for seven months in 1916 while Billy Hughes was overseas).  \n Malcolm Turnbull has held the office of Prime Minister since 15 September 2015. He received his commission after replacing Tony Abbott as the leader of the Liberal Party, the dominant party in the Coalition government, following the outcome of the September 2015 Liberal leadership ballot.  \n Former Prime Ministers continue to be important national figures, and in some cases go on to significant post-prime ministerial careers. Some notable examples have included: Edmund Barton, who was a justice of the High Court; George Reid, Andrew Fisher, Joseph Cook and Stanley Bruce, who were High Commissioners to the United Kingdom; Arthur Fadden, who was Treasurer under another prime minister, Robert Menzies; and Kevin Rudd, who became Julia Gillard's Foreign Minister. \n Appointment \n The Prime Minister of Australia is appointed by the Governor-General of Australia under Section 64 of the Australian Constitution, which empowers the Governor-General to appoint Ministers of the Crown and requires such Ministers to be members of the House of Representatives or the Senate, or become members within three months of the appointment. Before being sworn in as a minister, a person must first be sworn in as a member of the Federal Executive Council if they are not already a member. Membership of the Federal Executive Council entitles the member to the style of The Honourable (usually abbreviated to The Hon) for life, barring exceptional circumstances. The senior members of the Executive Council constitute the Cabinet of Australia. \n The Prime Minister is, like other ministers, normally sworn in by the Governor-General and then presented with the commission (Letters patent) of office. When defeated in an election, or on resigning, the Prime Minister is said to \"hand in the commission\" and actually does so by returning it to the Governor-General. In the event of a Prime Minister dying in office, or becoming incapacitated, the Governor-General can terminate the commission. Ministers hold office \"during the pleasure of the Governor-General\" (s. 64 of the Constitution of Australia), so theoretically, the Governor-General can dismiss a minister at any time, by notifying them in writing of the termination of their commission; however, his or her power to do so except on the advice of the Prime Minister is heavily circumscribed by convention. \n Despite the importance of the office of prime minister, the Constitution does not mention the office by name. The conventions of the Westminster system were thought to be sufficiently entrenched in Australia by the authors of the Constitution that it was deemed unnecessary to detail them. The formal title of the portfolio has always been simply \"Prime Minister\", except for the period of the Fourth Deakin Ministry (June 1909 to April 1910), when it was known as \"Prime Minister (without portfolio)\".  \n If a government cannot get its appropriation (budget) legislation passed by the House of Representatives, or the House passes a vote of \"no confidence\" in the government, the Prime Minister is", "parametric_answer": "anthony albanese", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}
{"question": "The name of which chemical element of the Periodic Table ends with the letters KEL ?", "answers": ["nickel"], "context": "Chemical elementA chemical element or element is a species of atoms having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei (i.e. the same atomic number, Z).  There are 118 elements that have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the crust of Earth.  \n Chemical elements constitute all of the ordinary matter of the universe. However astronomical observations suggest that ordinary observable matter is only approximately 15% of the matter in the universe: the remainder is dark matter, the composition of which is unknown, but it is not composed of chemical elements.  \n The two lightest elements, hydrogen and helium were mostly formed in the Big Bang and are the most common elements in the universe. The next three elements (lithium, beryllium and boron) were formed mostly by cosmic ray spallation, and are thus more rare than those that follow. Formation of elements with from six to twenty six protons occurred and continues to occur in main sequence stars via stellar nucleosynthesis. The high abundance of oxygen, silicon, and iron on Earth reflects their common production in such stars. Elements with greater than twenty-six protons are formed by supernova nucleosynthesis in supernovae, which, when they explode, blast these elements far into space as supernova remnants, where they may become incorporated into planets when they are formed.  \n The term \"element\" is used for a kind of atoms with a given number of protons (regardless of whether they are or they are not ionized or chemically bonded, e.g. hydrogen in water) as well as for a pure chemical substance consisting of a single element (e.g. hydrogen gas). For the second meaning, the terms \"elementary substance\" and \"simple substance\" have been suggested, but they have not gained much acceptance in the English-language chemical literature, whereas in some other languages their equivalent is widely used (e.g. French corps simple, Russian простое вещество). One element can form multiple substances different by their structure; they are called allotropes of the element. \n When different elements are chemically combined, with the atoms held together by chemical bonds, they form chemical compounds.  Only a minority of elements are found uncombined as relatively pure minerals. Among the more common of such \"native elements\" are copper, silver, gold, carbon (as coal, graphite, or diamonds), and sulfur. All but a few of the most inert elements, such as noble gases and noble metals, are usually found on Earth in chemically combined form, as chemical compounds. While about 32 of the chemical elements occur on Earth in native uncombined forms, most of these occur as mixtures. For example, atmospheric air is primarily a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, and native solid elements occur in alloys, such as that of iron and nickel. \n The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that found native elements like carbon, sulfur, copper and gold. Later civilizations extracted elemental copper, tin, lead and iron from their ores by smelting, using charcoal. Alchemists and chemists subsequently identified many more, with almost all of the naturally-occurring elements becoming known by 1900. \n The properties of the chemical elements are summarized on the periodic table, which organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows (\"periods\") in which the columns (\"groups\") share recurring (\"periodic\") physical and chemical properties. Save for unstable radioactive elements with short half-lives, all of the elements are available industrially, most of them in high degrees of purity. \n Description \n The lightest chemical elements are hydrogen and helium, both created by Big Bang nucleosynthesis during the first 20 minutes of the universe  in a ratio of around 3:1 by mass (or 12:1 by number of atoms),   along with tiny traces of", "parametric_answer": "tellurium", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

Aside from his contributions to the method and theory of science, he was also hugely influential in ensuring that science in general, and Britain in particular, had an administrative setup that encouraged new scientists and a public interest in the new art. \n Fellow \n Newton's first formal contact with the Royal Society came in 1671. The society had been set up just a couple of decades earlier 1 by a group of 'natural philosophers', including the man who would go on to be Newton's predecessor as Lucasian Professor, Isaac Barrow. Yet of all the mathematical and scientific insights that Newton could have brought to this gentlemen's club, it was his practical abilities that effected his first introduction. \n In 1668 and 1669, he had set himself to build a telescope. In retrospect, we can see that this project was inextricably tied to his other interests. He needed accurate measurements of the planets, and who better to make them than himself? Yet at the same time, he knew from his work on optics that a lens must inevitably split the various colours of light and therefore blur the image it produced. So he decided to base his telescope not around lenses, but around curved mirrors - he would make the world's first reflecting telescope. \n When finished, it was a marvel of science. He had built it from scratch, using tools he had made himself, even casting the tin/copper alloy he used for the mirror (no doubt using his alchemical techniques). It was this, rather than his theoretical or empirical accomplishments, that gained him the election to Fellow of the Royal Society on 11 January, 1672. \n Newton retained his Fellowship throughout his active scientific career, although since he was based in Cambridge, he seldom attended meetings of the London-based Society. Rather, it was often the territory of his rivals, particularly Robert Hooke, who became Curator of Experiments and then Secretary of the Society during this period. \n President \n By the time Newton became President, on 30 November, 1703, the Royal Society had fallen on hard times. The last few Presidents, including Samuel Pepys and Newton's patron Charles Montagu, had been non-scientists who had at most a dilettante interest in the goings-on. In fact, you would have to go back to Christopher Wren in 1682 to find anyone with a serious commitment to science in the role. Few of the members had any interest in the financial running of the Society, and as a consequence it was insolvent. And now, to cap it all, the Society faced eviction from its rooms. \n Shortly after becoming President, the aged Newton - who had had at least two full careers since he last did any noteworthy scientific investigation - presented his Opticks to the Society 2 . Like the Principia, this was in three volumes (a planned fourth was to contain a 'Unified Theory of Everything', which Newton never achieved). Even more so than the Principia, this was a wide-ranging book. As well as finally publishing his early experiments with prisms, Newton ran through a laundry-list of virtually every unpublished scientific idea he had ever had, even touching on Biblical topics such as Noah's Flood. But it cemented Newton in the mind of both the public and the Society as the pre-eminent scientist of the age, paving the way for the longest Presidency in the history of the RS 3 . \n Newton's tenure as President was undoubtedly long and successful, but it could hardly be called a model Presidency. Newton regarded the RS as his tool. His power was absolute, his presence at meetings was, until his final illness, almost invariable.

{"question": "Ridden by jockey Brian Fletcher, which horse won the 1968 Grand National at odds of 100 / 7 ?", "answers": ["red alligator"], "context": "Brian FletcherBrian Fletcher (born 18 May 1947) is an English Jockey notable for riding the horse Red Rum to win the Grand National in 1973 and 1974 and for second place in 1975. He first won the Grand National at the age of 20, in 1968 riding  Red Alligator.  He retired in 1976 with head injury. Apart from Ernie Piggott, (Lester Piggott's grandfather) and George Stevens (who won five times in the 19th century) Brian Fletcher is the only jockey to have won the Grand National three times.  Winning the Scottish National in 1974. His winning, record time on Red Rum in the 1973 Grand National was to stand for 17 years till beaten by Mr Frisk ridden by Marcus Armytage. \n Personal life \n Fletcher was born and brought up in Cockfield, County Durham. He now farms sheep and breeding Welsh Cobs on a 36 acre farm in Carmarthenshire, Wales.  Since his move to Wales, Brian Fletcher takes part in Harness Racing, winning driving Hendre Harrier in September 2004 at Ammanford  and occasionally is invited as VIP to racing meets in the UK.  \n Notes  National Legend – Brian Fletcher - Aintree Grand NationalNational Legend – Brian Fletcher - Aintree Grand National \n Aintree Grand National \n National Legend – Brian Fletcher \n March 6th, 2012 by admin \n Over its long history, the world’s greatest steeplechase has given us so many legends, that it’s often hard to recall all of them. \n But there are some that somehow seem to slip through the net. The name of one of the greatest ever National sportsmen in living memory will mean nothing much to the majority of young people today. Yet they will know of the name Red Rum, Ginger McCain and maybe even Tommy Stack who, of course, rode the legendary horse to his third and, arguably, greatest victory of all. But this, sadly, doesn’t do justice to Brian Fletcher. \n To look at how and why the National and Brian’s fates seemed inextricably linked for almost a decade, we need to go back to 1968. The then 19-year old Geordie lad won the greatest race of them all on the 100-7 shot Red Alligator – a horse trained by Denys Smith which was carrying just 10 stones. \n This was the young Fletcher’s second ride in the race. The year before, he finished a very creditable third on the same horse in the race made famous by the mass pile-up at the 23rd fence and Foinavon’s unlikely 100-1 victory. Brian, like almost every other jockey in the race that year, had had to remount. \n But in 1968, the young Geordie gave Red Alligator a perfect ride and won the race by 20 lengths from Moidore’s Token and the Gregory Peck-owned horse Different Class, in third. \n Despite his excellent ride, Brian failed to successfully negotiate the course in his next three Nationals – but of course the best was still to come.        Yet it didn’t look like \n it would for quite a while after Brian suffered a crashing fall at Stockton Racecourse during February 1972, after which he remained unconscious for ten days. \n Nevertheless, he made a determined return to racing later that year, and was asked to ride Red Rum in the 1973 National, by Ginger McCain. The rest, of course, is history. Brian expertly piloted a young Red Rum, who was carrying 10 stones 5 pounds, and just caught Crisp on the line in what was the fastest National of all time and arguably the most memorable. \n The next year, 1974, Red Rum became the first horse since Reynoldstwon in 1936, to retain a National crown - this time carrying 12 stones. Again, Brian’s technique was superb as he let Rummy lob along for a circuit before making gradual progress through the field. \n In 1975, Brian again partnered Rummy, this time finishing a close second when giving weight to double Cheltenham Gold Cup winner L’Escargot. \n Sadly, Brian lost the ride on Red Rum the following year to Tommy Stack, yet still managed to finish third on Eyecatcher, just behind his former horse, who was second", "parametric_answer": "red rum", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

It is not the first time that the Tu-144 makes his appearance on this site , but this is the first time that I had the chance to see one of them for real. \n Like the Concorde, the Tu-144 struggled to consolidate itself as a real alternative to conventional sub-sonic jetliners. Its career was actually shorter than that of its Western equivalent (coincidentally enough, both the Concorde and the Tu-144 had fatal accidents near Paris ). Its design started in 1962, but it was not until 1977 when the Tu-144 entered service with Aeroflot on the route between Moscow and Alma Ata, the then capital of the Soviet republic of Kazhastan). Only 55 scheduled passenger flights were completed with mail and cargo services making the remaining of 102 commercial services that the Tu-144 ever flew before it was withdrawn from service in 1978 because of its technical unreliability. \n In any case, the Tupolev Tu-144 remains quite an impressive aircraft, with an absolutely majestic look. There was quite a long queue to get inside the aircraft on display at MAKS, so I could take only a few pictures of the outside that I have compiled in this Tu-144 photo gallery. \n By the way, in our last article about the Tu-144 we mentioned also Russia's aerospace industry's plans to launch a new civilian supersonic aircraft programme, just that this time it won't be not an airliner that showcasing the state-of-the-art of communist technology but something more capitalistic: an executive jet. I am talking, of course, about the Sukhoi Supersonic Business Jet. Well, of whom there was a mock-up at MAKS, giving you an idea of how it might look like.  Tupolev Tu-144The Tupolev Tu-144 (NATO reporting name \"Charger\") is a retired jet airliner, which was the world's first commercial supersonic transport aircraft (SST). It is one of only two SSTs to enter commercial service, the other being the Anglo-French Concorde. The design was constructed in the Soviet Union under the direction of the Tupolev design bureau, headed by Alexei Tupolev. Throughout its 55-flight operational history in passenger service, the Tu-144 flew at an average service altitude of  and cruised at a speed of around .  \n The prototype first flew on 31 December 1968 near Moscow, two months before the first flight of Concorde. The Tu-144 first went supersonic on 5 June 1969, and on 26 May 1970 became the first commercial transport to exceed Mach 2.  \n A Tu-144 crashed in 1973 at the Paris Air Show, delaying its further development. The aircraft was introduced into passenger service on 1 November 1977, almost two years after Concorde, because of budget restrictions. In May 1978, another Tu-144 (an improved version, named Tu-144D) crashed in a test flight while being delivered, and the passenger fleet was permanently grounded after only 55 scheduled flights. The aircraft remained in use as a cargo aircraft until 1983, by which point a total of 102 commercial flights had been completed. The Tu-144 was later used by the Soviet space program to train pilots of the Buran  spacecraft, and by NASA for supersonic research. \n Development \n The Soviet government published the concept of the Tu-144 in an article in the January 1962 issue of the magazine Technology of Air Transport. The air ministry started development of the Tu-144 on 26 July 1963, 10 days after the design was approved by the Council of Ministers. The plan called for five flying prototypes to be built in four years, with the first aircraft to be ready in 1966. \n The MiG-21I (1968; Izdeliye 21-11; \"Analog\") I = Imitator (\"Simulator\") was a testbed for the wing design of the Tu-144. \n Despite", "parametric_answer": "boeing 727", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}
{"question": "\"Which energy drink, introduced in 1987 has the advertising slogan \"\"gives you wings\"\"?\"", "answers": ["red bull", "red bull energy", "gives you wings", "red bull energy drink"], "context": "Energy drinkAn energy drink is a type of beverage containing stimulant drugs, chiefly caffeine, which is marketed as providing mental and physical stimulation. They may or may not be carbonated and many also contain sugar or other sweeteners, herbal extracts and amino acids. They are a subset of the larger group of energy products, which includes bars and gels, and distinct from sports drinks, which are advertised to enhance sports performance. There are many brands and varieties of energy drinks. \n Coffee, tea and other naturally caffeinated beverages are usually not considered energy drinks. Other soft drinks such as cola may contain caffeine, but are also not energy drinks. Some alcoholic beverages, such as Buckfast Tonic Wine, contain caffeine and other stimulants. According to the Mayo Clinic, it is safe for the typical healthy adult to consume a total of 400 mg of caffeine a day. This has been confirmend by a panel of the European Food Safety Authority (ESFA), which also concludes that a caffeine intake of up to 400 mg per day does not raise safety concerns for adults. According to the ESFA this is equivalent to 4 cups of coffee (90 mg each) or 5 standard cans (250 ml) of energy drink (80 mg each).   \n Energy drinks have the effects caffeine and sugar provide, but there is little or no evidence that the wide variety of other ingredients have any effect.  Most of the effects of energy drinks on cognitive performance, such as increased attention and reaction speed, are primarily due to the presence of caffeine.  Other studies, however, ascribe those performance improvements to the effects of the combined ingredients.  Advertising for energy drinks usually features increased muscle strength and endurance, but there is still no scientific consensus to support these statements.  Energy drinks have been associated with health risks, such as an increased rate of alcohol-related injury, and excessive or repeated consumption can lead to cardiac and psychiatric conditions. \n Uses \n Energy drinks are marketed to provide the benefits among health effects of caffeine along with benefits from the other ingredients they contain.  Health experts agree that energy drinks which contain caffeine do provide the effects of caffeine. The consumption of alcohol drinks combined with energy drinks is a common occurrence on many college campuses. The alcohol industry has recently been criticized for marketing cohesiveness of alcohol and energy drinks. The combination of the two in college students is correlated to students experiencing alcohol-related consequences, and several health risks.  \n There is no good evidence that other ingredients in energy drinks provide further benefits, even though the drinks are frequently advertised in a way that suggests they have unique benefits.  The dietary supplements in energy drinks may be purported to provide detoxification, sustain mental process, protect heart health, and reduce muscle fatigue.   None of these claims are backed by good evidence, however, the ingredients alone, for example taurine or vitamin B, are scientifically proven to provide positive effects on the metabolism.M.

Whereas most energy drinks are sold in cans or bottles, energy shots are usually sold in smaller 50ml bottles.

In 1982 it changed its name to the Free Trade Anti-Common Market Party. No seats have been contested since 1983. \n Highest vote: D.W. Bundy (Hertfordshire, South-West, 1979(13/12)) - 288 votes, 0.8%. \n APNI Alliance Party of Northern Ireland \n Northern Ireland's centre party, allied to the Liberal Democrats in Great Britain. It was founded in April 1970 and is fairly rare in Northern Ireland politics in being non-sectarian, and unlike the SDLP, not on any particular side over the constitutional issue. The Party has had one MP though only through defection - Stratton Mills joined in 1972 but retired in 1974. The Party leader is Dr John Alderdice, a 41 year old psychiatrist and Belfast City Councillor. \n Address: 88 University Street, Belfast BT7 1HE.

Alderdice (Belfast, East, 1987) - 10,574 votes, 32.1%. \n BNP British National Party \n The BNP was formed in 1982 from a split in the National Front, led by John Tyndall. Its political stance is far right and the group has been linked to the group 'Combat 18' (the first and eighth letters of the alphabet being Adolf Hitler's initials). The BNP has elected one councillor, Derek Beackon, for Millwall Ward of Tower Hamlets Borough from 1993-4.

The origins of the party are back in the late seventeenth century when a group of people supporting the Duke of York's claim on the throne were given the nickname 'Tories' (an anglicised form of the Irish gaelic word 'Toraidhe', meaning pursuer). They later became a political opposition to William and Mary's supporters, the Whigs. In 1830 at the suggestion of J.W.

But, sometimes the past can be a lesson. Everything that happens now, come because of a history in the past. Life of somebody can not be separated from his/her past. For some people , their history and experiences can become an inspiration to write a story, novel, or poetry. In the past it was popular with people wrote about their life into a diary. These days with development of technologies many people write their life in a blog. For example, the ex-soldier wrote about his experience when was involved in a war. Moreover, many public figures write their biography. \n The Black Cat Cover \n “The Black Cat” is a famous short story from  Edgar Allan Poe. It is a story about domestic  violence and brutal murder. It’s the confession of nameless man who destroys himself, his wife, and his pets. The Black Cat tells about a man who loved his pet so much, but because  the effect of alcoholism, he changed from a lover into a brutal man. He killed his pet named Pluto, the black cat.  Edgar Allan Poe is known as  a fascinating person, and has a popular reputation as a creepy guy, some readers are tempted to imagine that Poe and his narrators are one in the same. I wonder whether Poe had same habits like the man in the story or not. Most of Poe’s works are  gothic. I am interested whether it has a connection with his life or not .  As far as we know, Poe was no murderer. He seemed to have loving relationship with his wife, and is reported to have been a cat lover. I think some of the Poe’s life reflect in this story. His habit who loved his wife or cat and popular opinion that say he was an alcoholic become the inspiration of “The Black Cat” . By analyzing this, we will know the effect of the author’s life and history in the literary work. \n Biography  of The Author \n Edgar Allan Poe was born  on January 19, 1809, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.  He was an American short-story writer, poet, critic, and editor . Edgar Allan Poe’s tales of mystery and horror initiated the modern detective story, and the atmosphere in his tales of horror is unrivaled in American fiction. \n With his short stories and poems, Edgar Allan Poe captured the imagination and interest of readers around the world. His creative talents led to the beginning of different literary genres, earning him the nickname “Father of the Detective Story” among other distinctions. His life, however, has become a bit of mystery itself. And the lines between fact and fiction have been blurred substantially since his death. \n The son of actors, Poe never really knew his parents. His father left the family early on, and his mother passed away when he was only three. Separated from his siblings, Poe went to live with John and Frances Allan, a successful tobacco merchant and his wife, in Richmond, Virginia. He and Frances seemed to form a bond, but he never quite meshed with John. Preferring poetry over profits, Poe reportedly wrote poems on the back of some of Allan’s business papers. \n Money was also an issue between Poe and John Allan. When Poe went to the University of Virginia in 1826, he didn’t receive enough funds from Allan to cover all his costs. Poe turned to gambling to cover the difference, but ended up in debt. He returned home only to face another personal setback—his neighbor and fiancée Elmira Royster had become engaged to someone else. Heartbroken and frustrated, Poe left the Allans. \n At first, Poe seemed to be harboring twin aspirations.

The system scientists now use to classify organisms is called the Linnaean taxonomy system, named after Swedish biologist Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778), the “Father of Taxonomy.” This system has seven different levels of classification (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species) with the seventh level, species, being the most specific. There are many subdivisions of the seven levels of classifications, for example, subphylum or super class. \n The more levels two organisms have in common, the closer they are related. Lobsters and humans are not closely related at all; we only share a kingdom. But lobsters and crabs share kingdom, phylum, class, and order, so they are closely related. The most common way to list the taxonomic name of an organism is by using its genus and species, Homarus americanus. This is called binomial (bi for two, nomial for name) nomenclature (naming). \n Taxonomy of Homarus americanus \n All animals belong to this kingdom \n Phylum: Arthropoda \n The animals in this phylum all lack back bones and are known as invertebrates. They also all have external skeletons (exoskeleton), jointed appendages and segmented body. The name of this phylum literally means jointed (from Greek arthron) foot (from Greek podos). Arthropods are the largest group of animals in the world and members of this group can be found in every type of environment. Arthropods range in size, from less than a centimeter to over 3 meters. Some of the most commonly known arthropods include ants, butterflies, spiders, shrimp, and lobsters. \n Subphylum: Crustacea \n Animals in this group all have two-parted limbs, two pairs of antennae at some point in their life, and three body parts (head, thorax, and abdomen). The name crustacean comes from the hard, “crusty” outer shell most of the animals have. There is a wide range in sizes among animals in this group, from the smallest arthropod measuring 0.004 inches to the Japanese spider crab with a leg span of 12.5 feet. Crustaceans include crabs, woodlice, barnacles, shrimp and lobsters. \n Class: Malacostraca \n The name of this class is misleading. Malakos and ostrakon, both Greek roots, mean soft and shell, respectively. The animals in this class only have a soft shell immediately after molting. This class includes crab, shrimp and krill. \n Order: Decapoda \n All of the animals in the order decapod (deca meaning ten and poda meaning foot) have ten feet.

{"question": "In which town in Greater Manchester did Coronation Street actress Betty Driver sadly pass away recently?", "answers": ["stockport"], "context": "Greater ManchesterGreater Manchester is a metropolitan county in North West England, with a population of 2.8 million.  It encompasses one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United Kingdom and comprises ten metropolitan boroughs: Bolton, Bury, Oldham, Rochdale, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford, Wigan, and the cities of Manchester and Salford. Greater Manchester was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972; and designated a City Region on 1 April 2011. \n Greater Manchester spans 493 sqmi,  which roughly covers the territory of the Greater Manchester Built-up Area, the second most populous urban area in the UK. It is landlocked and borders Cheshire (to the south-west and south), Derbyshire (to the south-east), West Yorkshire (to the north-east), Lancashire (to the north) and Merseyside (to the west). There is a mix of high-density urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in Greater Manchester, but land use is mostly urban — the product of concentric urbanisation and industrialisation which occurred mostly during the 19th century when the region flourished as the global centre of the cotton industry. It has a focused central business district, formed by Manchester city centre and the adjoining parts of Salford and Trafford, but Greater Manchester is also a polycentric county with ten metropolitan districts, each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs. \n For the 12 years following 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government; district councils shared power with the Greater Manchester County Council. The county council was abolished in 1986, and so its districts (the metropolitan boroughs) effectively became unitary authority areas. However, the metropolitan county has continued to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference,•• and as a ceremonial county, has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff. Being within the Lancashire county palatine they are appointed by the monarch in their capacity as Duke of Lancaster.[http://www.duchyoflancaster.co.uk/2015/05/05/high-sheriffs-installed-across-the-county-palatine/ High Sheriffs Installed Across The County Palatine - Duchy of Lancaster] Several county-wide services were co-ordinated through the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities until April 2011, when the Greater Manchester Combined Authority was established as the strategic county-wide authority for Greater Manchester, taking on functions and responsibilities for economic development, regeneration and transport. A further devolution of powers to Greater Manchester is set to take place upon the election of the inaugural Mayor of Greater Manchester scheduled for 2017. \n Before the creation of the metropolitan county, the name SELNEC was used for the area, taken from the initials of \"South East Lancashire North East Cheshire\". Greater Manchester is an amalgamation of 70 former local government districts from the former administrative counties of Lancashire, Cheshire, the West Riding of Yorkshire and eight independent county boroughs.  Since deindustrialisation in the mid-20th century, Greater Manchester has emerged as an exporter of media and digital content, guitar and dance music, and association football. \n History \n Origins \n Although the modern county of Greater Manchester was not created until 1974, the history of its constituent settlements and parts goes back centuries. There is evidence of Iron Age habitation, particularly at Mellor, and Celtic activity in a settlement named Chochion, believed to have been an area of Wigan settled by the Brigantes.  Stretford was also part of the land believed to have been occupied by the Celtic Brigantes tribe, and lay on their border with the Cornovii on the southern side of the River Mersey. The remains of 1st-century forts at Castlefield in Manchester,  and Castleshaw Roman fort in Saddleworth,  are evidence of Roman occupation. The area was settled by Anglo-Saxons, who named it \"Mameham\". Much of the region was omitted from the Domesday Book of 1086; Redhead states that this was because only a partial survey was taken, rather than sparsity of population. \n During the Middle Ages, much of what became Greater Manchester lay within the hundred of Salfordshire – an ancient division of the county of Lancashire.

The story and emotional content of a musical – humor, pathos, love, anger – are communicated through the words, music, movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole. Although musical theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like opera and dance, it may be distinguished by the equal importance given to the music as compared with the dialogue, movement and other elements. Since the early 20th century, musical theatre stage works have generally been called, simply, musicals. \n Although music has been a part of dramatic presentations since ancient times, modern Western musical theatre emerged during the 19th century, with many structural elements established by the works of Gilbert and Sullivan in Britain and those of Harrigan and Hart in America.  These were followed by the numerous Edwardian musical comedies and the musical theatre works of American creators like George M. Cohan. The Princess Theatre musicals and other smart shows like Of Thee I Sing (1931) were artistic steps forward beyond revues and other frothy entertainments of the early 20th century and led to such groundbreaking works as Show Boat (1927) and Oklahoma! (1943).  Some of the most famous and iconic musicals through the decades that followed include \n West Side Story (1957), The Fantasticks (1960), Hair (1967), A Chorus Line (1975), Les Misérables (1985), The Phantom of the Opera (1986), Rent (1996), The Producers (2001), Wicked (2003) and Hamilton (2015). \n Musicals are performed around the world. They may be presented in large venues, such as big-budget Broadway or West End productions in New York City or London. Alternatively, musicals may be staged in smaller fringe theatre, Off-Broadway or regional theatre productions, or on tour. Musicals are often presented by amateur and school groups in churches, schools and other performance spaces. In addition to the United States and Britain, there are vibrant musical theatre scenes in continental Europe, Asia, Australasia, Canada and Latin America. \n Definitions and scope  \n Book musicals \n Since the 20th century, the \"book musical\" has been defined as a musical play where songs and dances are fully integrated into a well-made story with serious dramatic goals that is able to evoke genuine emotions other than laughter.   The three main components of a book musical are its music, lyrics and book. The book or script of a musical refers to the story, character development, and dramatic structure, including the spoken dialogue and stage directions, but it can also refer to the dialogue and lyrics together, which are sometimes referred to as the libretto (Italian for “little book”). The music and lyrics together form the score of a musical and includes songs; incidental music; and musical scenes, which are \"theatrical sequence[s] set to music, often combining song with spoken dialogue.\" The interpretation of a musical by is influenced by its creative team, which includes a director, a musical director, usually a choreographer and sometimes an orchestrator. A musical's production is also creatively characterized by technical aspects, such as set design, costumes, stage properties (props), lighting and sound, which generally change from the original production to succeeding productions. Some famous production elements, however, may be retained from the original production; for example, Bob Fosse's choreography in Chicago. \n There is no fixed length for a musical.", "parametric_answer": "fiddler on roof", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

The much-loved animated series is set to return to the BBC after 45 years in the space wilderness. Forget the target audience of pre-schoolers – it’s their misty-eyed parents who will be uncontainably excited by this news. \n The cult classic was made by the fabled founding fathers of UK animation, Peter Firmin and Oliver Postgate , whose company Smallfilms also produced Bagpuss , Ivor The Engine and Noggin The Nog . In 1969, Firmin and Postgate were asked by the Beeb to make a series for new-fangled colour television. They decided to set it in space because lunar exploration was all the rage that year. \n Hence the Clangers : a family of pink mouse-like creatures, living on a blue Moon-like planet. Their homes were in craters topped by dustbin lids which closed with a “clang” (hence their name). They spoke in distinctive hooted whistles (created by slide whistles), wore armour made from scrap metal, and ate blue string pudding and green broth supplied by the friendly Soup Dragon, who lived in the depths of the planet. \n The original 26 episodes aired between 1969 and 1972, before getting endlessly repeated and later becoming a regular fixture on retro list shows. So era-defining are the Clangers that their mere mention can make grown adults stare off into the middle distance, recalling an innocent youth of Spangles, spacehoppers and Clackers. \n Scottish indie band The Soup Dragons , who had a top five hit with \"I’m Free\" in 1990, were named in tribute to the show. The Clangers also crossed over with that other cult favourite, Doctor Who. In 1972 episode “The Sea Devils”, the Master was shown watching and chuckling at The Clangers. Villainous Timelords clearly have impeccable taste in TV. There was even a special episode made for the 1974 general election, entitled “Vote For Froglet!” and broadcast on polling day.

{"question": "In which year was the ten shilling note withdrawn in the UK following the introduction of the 50p coin ?", "answers": ["1970"], "context": "DECIMAL COINS - KEN ELKS HOME PAGEDECIMAL COINS \n 11. DECIMAL COINS \n   \n During Victorian times there was movement towards the introduction of a decimal coinage. As a preliminary, the half crown ceased to be minted in 1850 and a new coin, the florin with a value of two shillings, a tenth of a pound, took its place. Nevertheless, although the idea was finally abandoned and the half crown reintroduced in 1874, the florin continued to be minted. That the idea of decimalization still lingered is shown by the introduction of the double florin, one fifth of a pound, in 1887, but this coin proved unpopular and was discontinued after four years. At the time it was known as the \"Barmaid's ruin\" because it was so easily mistaken for the crown. \n In 1961 a Committee of Enquiry was set up to consider again the adoption of a decimal currency. In its report, published in 1968, it recommended a currency still based on the pound, but divided into a hundred pennies. A minority of the committee favoured a currency based on ten shillings, with each shilling worth ten pence. In the new system the florin would be retained and become ten new pence and the shilling five new pence and all new coins minted would show these values. There would be three new bronze coins with values of two, one and half new pence and a new fifty pence coin to replace the ten shilling note. The letter \"d\" to denote pence was to be replaced by \"p\", entering common parlance as \"pee\" or \"new pee\". Almost as an afterthought, the old sixpence was also retained with a value of two and a half new pence, but no more were to be minted. It eventually ceased to be legal tender in 1980. The new coinage was to become effective on 15 February 1971. \n As a preliminary, the cupro-nickel florins and shillings minted from 1968 onwards showed their value in new pence. The distinctive seven-sided fifty pence coin entered circulation in October 1969 and the following year, the ten shilling note ceased to be printed though it still remained in circulation for some years afterwards. Production of all the old denominations ceased as the Royal Mint geared up in readiness for the changeover. However, in 1968, before ceasing completely, a large number of souvenir proof sets in the old currency were minted dated 1970 and specimen sets of the new coins, but dated 1971, were made available at the same time. \n The introduction of decimalization in 1971 produced much confusion and anomalies. Dual pricing was allowed in order for people to adjust to the new coinage but this seemed to cause more problems than a quick changeover. Eventually a law was passed stating that all goods must be price only in new pence. \n Commemorative crowns were still issued with a value of 25 new pence. These were to celebrate the Queen's 25th Wedding Anniversary in 1971, her Silver Jubilee in 1977, the Queen Mother's 80th birthday in 1980 and finally the wedding of Price Charles and Lady Diana Spencer in 1981. Thereafter, all new crowns were given a value of ï¿½5, although the first of these did not appear until 1990. None of these coins were intended for circulation but they do have legal tender status. \n The decimal coinage remained unchanged until 1982 when a new seven-sided twenty pence coin was introduced. There had been considerable demand for such a coin for several years. At the same time the word \"New\" was dropped from the value shown on the reverse of all coins as it was considered that by now there would no longer be any confusion with the old coinage. The following year, the pound note was replaced with a brass coin due to inflation, which had made the printing of the notes uneconomic (they had a relatively short life and considerable security measures and controls had to be exercised in their printing). These brass coins make an interesting collection as each year the reverse design is changed, each reverse representing one of the nations that go to make up Britain. So far there have been at least ten different reverse types used. \n ï¿½1", "parametric_answer": "1971", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

Silicon is the second most abundant element (27.7%), followed by aluminum (8.1%), iron (5.0%), calcium (3.6%), sodium (2.8%), potassium (2.6%). and magnesium (2.1%).

These four are iron, oxygen, silicon and magnesium. These elements make up more than 90 percent of the Earth's mass. \n Iron \n The vast majority of the Earth's supply of iron is found in the core and the mantle. The solid inner core is almost entirely composed of iron, while the liquid outer core is an alloy of iron and nickel, with small amounts of lighter elements. The mantle is composed of iron-magnesium silicates, and the crust is composed of roughly 5 percent iron. All together, iron makes up an estimated 35 percent of the Earth's mass. \n Oxygen \n Oxygen, the second most abundant element on Earth, is found mainly in the crust. Although oxygen is most often thought of as an atmospheric gas, it is also one of the primary components of the silicate minerals that make up the vast majority of the Earth's crust. Oxygen itself makes up approximately 46.6 percent of the crust and 30 percent of the mass of the entire Earth. \n Silicon \n Silicon is found in compounds in both the mantle and the crust, making it the third most abundant element. In the mantle, it combines with iron and magnesium and, in the crust, with oxygen in the form of silicate minerals. These minerals make up common compounds such as quartz, mica and talc, as well as rare stones such as emeralds and opals. All together, silicon accounts for approximately 15 percent of the Earth's mass. \n Magnesium \n Since the majority of the Earth's volume is taken up by its liquid mantle, it makes sense that magnesium, one of the mantle's key components, is the fourth most abundant element on", "parametric_answer": "oxygen", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

It stood at 19.2% in April to June 2010. \n Some of the change is demographic rather than attributable to a government policy. The ONS said the fall of 182,000 in the number of workless households in the UK was partly due to some households moving from containing at least one person aged 16-64 to containing all people aged 65 and over \"and therefore not being included in the analysis\". \n The ageing workforce had a significant knock-on effect. The ONS stated that there had been a drop of 124,000 in the number of 50- to 64-year-olds who were living in workless households. \n This meant that the total number of working age people living in workless households fell below 5 million for the first time since April to June 2008. In the quarter ending June 2013, the number of people in workless households who are aged between 16 and 64 fell by 132,000 to 4.9 million. \n By contrast there was a 15,000 increase in the number of 16- to 24-year-olds who were living in workless households. \n The ONS said the most common reason people aged 16 to 64 in workless households gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled, with 28% saying this was the reason for not getting a job. This was followed by unemployment (21%), early retirement (17%), looking after the family or home (15%) and study (13%). \n Households where no one has ever worked are part of the workless households group and the ONS noted that the number of these households continued to drop since its peak in 2011, when the country had more than 350,000 such households. \n In 2013 there were 297,000 households where no one had ever worked, containing 500,000 people. However, analysts have cautioned against overinterpreting this figure: nearly half, or 48%, of these people were students and a further 18% were sick or disabled. \n Only 10% – about 50,000 people – had never worked because of unemployment. The remainder either stated they were looking after the family or home (14%) or other reasons (10%). \n The data also reveals that single parents are much more likely to be in a workless household than couples with children. The ONS found 36% of households that contained lone parents with dependent children were workless in April to June 2013, which contrasts with 5% of households that contained couples with dependent children. \n There were 1.6 million children growing up in households where nobody was in work and most of these children, or 65%, were living in households with just one parent. \n Although the number of children living in workless households had risen after the economic downturn, this has fallen to 14% in 2013. This is the lowest since 1996 when the figure was first recorded and revealed one in every five children, or 20%, were living in workless households. \n Larry Elliott: Labour blames austerity for high number of NEETs – young people not in work, education or training \n Published: 22 Aug 2013", "parametric_answer": "children", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

At 17 he entered the Leningrad Ballet School, where he was taught by Aleksandr Pushkin. He was an outstanding but rebellious student, refusing to join the Komsomol (Communist youth organization), disobeying curfew regulations, and learning English privately. \n After graduating in 1958, he became soloist with the Leningrad (St. Petersburg) Kirov (now Mariinsky ) Ballet and danced leading roles with its touring company.

He said later that the rigidly organized Soviet ballet had limited his opportunities to dance frequently and to perform in a variety of roles. \n After his defection he danced with the Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas and made his American debut in 1962, appearing on American television and with Ruth Page’s Chicago Opera Ballet. Later that year he joined the Royal Ballet (London) as permanent guest artist, but he never became a member of a major dance troupe in the West, preferring to work with various companies on a temporary basis. \n Nureyev became well known as Dame Margot Fonteyn ’s favourite partner. Dancing with her, he interpreted such roles as Albrecht in Giselle, Armand in Marguerite and Armand, and Prince Siegfried in Swan Lake. He was a popular guest artist in companies large and small throughout the world. Also working as a choreographer, Nureyev reworked Swan Lake (Vienna, 1964), giving the dominant role to the male dancer. His version of Sergey Prokofiev’s Romeo and Juliet (1977) was produced by the London Festival Ballet , and his Manfred (1979) was performed by the Paris Opéra Ballet . In 1980 Nureyev staged The Nutcracker for the Berlin Ballet, and in 1981, owing to a further resurgence of interest in dance in Italy, Nureyev staged his version of Romeo and Juliet at La Scala , with Fonteyn as Lady Capulet. Nureyev’s capabilities also extended to modern repertoires , and he performed in works by Martha Graham , Murray Louis , and Paul Taylor .

Propulsion \n The quanter stands at the front of the barge or, for a punt, normally on the rear deck. The angle at which the quant is held depends on the depth of the water and the desired speed of travel. A steeper angle is required for deeper water (the bottom of the quant must be able to reach the bed of the river or canal) and a shallower angle required for speed. The quanter drives the quant downward and slightly backward to push the craft forwards. On a larger boat, the quanter then walks down the side of the boat, facing aft and braced against the quant pole, the boat being propelled forward at the speed he walks. To reverse, the quant can be pushed forwards. The quant is then pulled out of the water by placing hand over hand on it and pulling upwards (as if one were climbing down a pole).  \n When punting, as in Oxford and Cambridge, the quanter stands stationary at the back (Oxford and Cambridge disagree on which is the rear end: decked in Cambridge and undecked in Oxford) and slides the quant into the water at an angle forwards. As the punt glides forwards the loosely held quant becomes increasingly vertical. When the quant is just past vertical i.e. sloping downwards from front to back of the punt, the quanter pushes on the quant to propel the punt forwards. At the end of the pushing stroke the quant is twisted with a downward roll of the wrists to break it free from the bottom, and then retrieved by being thrown forwards hand-over-", "parametric_answer": "pole", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

Cobham Brewer, 1894  The Anglo-Saxon YearThe Anglo-Saxon Year \n Article written for the IPC Diary \n The Anglo-Saxon Year \n by Arlea Hunt-Anschütz \n Bede (673-735), the scholar and monk best known for his Ecclesiastical History of the English People also wrote a Latin treatise called The Reckoning of Time with the purpose of explaining how the dates of Christian festivals should be calculated.  In this book he includes a chapter on 'The English Months', by which he means the months the heathen English observed before they adopted the Roman calendar along with Christianity.   In doing so he preserved some pagan Anglo-Saxon lore which would otherwise have been lost. \n The early Anglo-Saxons divided the year into twelve lunar months (literally 'moons'), but as a lunar cycle is about 29.5 days,  this would result in a 354 day year.  After two or three 12 month years, the lunar cycle and the solar cycle (of 365 days) would be off by what amounted to a little more or less than a month.  Every so often, the early Anglo-Saxons would have a 13 month year to get the lunar and solar cycles back into alignment. They inserted the extra month into the summer sailing season, called liða, which normally covered two months roughly corresponding to June and July.  Thus, the 13 month year was called Ðriliði (three liðas). \n According to Bede, the year began on Modranecht, Mothers' Night, the 25th of December \"when we celebrate the birth of our lord\".   There has been a lot of speculation by both scholars and pagan authors as to who or what  the 'mothers' in this word refers to.   Many believe the Anglo- Saxons would have honoured Germanic female ancestral spirits  known as the Idisi on this day. \n The months corresponding to December and January were both known as Giuli, 'Yules'.  Bede implies that Geola, Yule, was the name for the winter solstice when he states that these months \"derive their name from the day when the Sun turns back to increase, because one precedes and the other follows\".  But judging by the names of the months it's equally possible that Geola was the name for the whole midwinter season. December was Ærra Geola, which can be interpreted as either 'first Yule' or 'preceding Yule', and January was �fterra Geola, 'following Yule'. \n February was known as Solmonað.  According to Bede, the name comes from the cakes which they offered to their gods in that month.   However, the word sol is not used in any Anglo-Saxon source to mean 'cake'.  It's most common meaning is, in fact, 'mud'.  Two possibilities arise. Either the kind of cake offered was called 'mud' due to its colour or texture, or, more plausibly (to those familiar with the English climate), February was simply known as 'Mudmonth'. \n March was Hreðmonað.  Bede writes that this month is named for the goddess Hre�a \"to whom they sacrificed at this time\". Hreða proves to be quite a shadowy figure.  Though today's heathens have re-established links with this goddess, there is no existing lore about her.  In his Teutonic Mythology, Jakob Grimm (of Grimm's Fairy Tales fame) presents evidence that in some parts of Germany the old name for March was Retmonat or Redtimonet, names which seem to be directly cognate with the Anglo-Saxon. This is the only evidence we have that the goddess Hreða may have been known outside of England. \n For the heathen Anglo-Saxons, April corresponded with the lunar month of Eostermonað.  Bede writes that this month was named after a goddess Eostre, in whose honour feasts were celebrated at this time.

The actor left an estimated $600m - $1bn fortune, largely the yield of her scent empire, it was revealed yesterday. \n In 1987 Taylor invented the \"celebrity perfume\" franchise with her first fragrance, Passion, and released her last, Violet Eyes, in 2010. But while today such merchandise is often the result of a popstar turning up to a photoshoot and pointing at a bottle, Taylor's had a genuine flair. \n A shrewd businesswoman, she teamed up with the respected Elizabeth Arden company and supervised the entire collection of 11 perfumes, even when her health failed. Unusually, she also always wore her own creation, the top-selling White Diamonds (actor Richard Harris was allegedly kicked out of Taylor's mansion for drinking it), and never took her side job for granted – perhaps because perfumery gave her a fatter paycheck than Hollywood ever did. \n But how could an actor who had seldom worked in her last decades, and whose beauty had long since been lost to illness and obesity, continue to shift more perfume than Britney and JLo at the peak of their powers? It's simple – Taylor represented true glamour at a time when stars are divided between the po-faced elite and the downmarket oversharers. Nobody wants to smell of soy lattes, yoga mats and macrobiotic baby food. Much less beef curries, Prozac and tears. Taylor instead offered a heady world where men were alpha and women were unapologetically, lethally, feminine. \n Yet Richard Burton's observation that Taylor was \"too bloody much\" could just as accurately have been levelled at her potent scents.

{"question": "What, that you might wear, may be welted?", "answers": ["shoes"], "context": "Best Welding Boots & Shoes For 2016 - Welding Helmet ProsBest Welding Boots & Shoes For 2017 - Welding Helmet Pros \n 2. Timberland PRO Men’s 53580 8″ Metguard Steel- Toe Boot \n The Good \n Whenever you’re looking for a pair of welding boots you should pay close attention to the metatarsal guards, as these are usually the parts that offer the greatest protection. Never has this been truer than with these boots from Timberland. \n In this case, the metatarsal guards are both hinged and asymmetrical, so they protect all the way down the tops of the feet, even if you’re bending or squatting. They actually conform to fit your natural foot shape, so they’re far more comfortable than you’d usually expect welding boots to be – right from the very first wear! \n The Ever-Guard leather is waterproof and the stitching has been done with Kevlar thread, so the quality and durability of these boots is outstanding. They feature steel toe caps which are nice and roomy (which just makes them feel even more comfortable), protecting from heat and impact whether you’re indoors or outdoors. \n If you do choose to wear these boots outdoors then the tough rubber sole will prevent you from slipping on wet or oily surfaces, but if you’re indoors it will guard against abrasion. \n The Bad \n The sturdy, robust nature of these boots makes them fairly heavy, which can be tiring to wear for long periods. Leg and ankle fatigue is a very real problem with these boots, but look on the bright side – wearing them will strengthen your muscles! \n However, one other annoying problem that some people have noticed is that the stitching at the back usually starts to come apart after just a few months, so they don’t have quite as long a lifespan as you might expect from a reputable brand like Timberland. \n Conclusion \n Overall, this is another great set of boots from Timberland which provides more than adequate protection for welding and other construction jobs. \n 3. Rocky Duty Men’s Modern Paraboot \n The Good \n You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to notice that these boots are significantly taller than most other dedicated welding boots on the market. At 10 inches tall, they protect the bottom part of the legs as well as the feet, which can only be a good thing in a potentially dangerous workshop. However, even though they’re tall, they’re not difficult to put on and take off; they have been made with a side zip which means it’s only a matter of moments before you can get to work. \n These boots always look smart, because you can polish the water-resistant full grain leather uppers – and it’s this same material that gives these boots much of their strength, resilience and protection. Last but not least, not only do they look good, but they’re super comfortable too, thanks to a contoured, cushioned footbed. Even at the end of a long day filled with welding and standing on your feet, your feet won’t feel much discomfort at all! \n The Bad \n First and foremost, there are no metguards, so the tops of these boots (including the laces) are not protected from any spillages or burns. \n In addition, they are unlined, so instead of wicking away sweat or moisture they can leave feet feeling hot, sweaty and unpleasant. Some loyal followers of the brand have reported that the quality isn’t as good as it has been in the past, but given that the boots are still really protective, whether or not this is an issue is something that only you can decide! \n Conclusion \n Perhaps these boots don’t offer quite the same level of quality as in the past, but they’re still a comfortable pair of boots that protects the feet, ankles and lower leg. \n 4. Caterpillar Men’s Assault Work Boot \n The Good \n As soon as you put them on you’ll notice that these boots feel really secure and supportive to wear. \n The ankles are supported by a padded collar at the top of each boot, which provide comfort instead of rubbing.

Although five species are described, only two, C. annuum and C. frutescens have any significance commercially in the U.S.A. Early species separation on the basis of fruit shape, color and position are of little taxonomic value. Flower and seed color, shape of the calyx, the number of flowers per node and their orientation, are the primary separating characteristics. A simple key to identifying the five domesticated species of Capsicum may be found on page 1996 of \"Peppers of the World--an Identification Guide\" by Dave DeWitt and Paul W. Bosland, Ten Speed Press, PO Box 7123, Berkeley, CA 97407. \n C. annuum is the most important domesticated species in the U.S.A. and is the species to which all bell peppers, and all the peppers listed below belong (unless specified otherwise.) The only C. frutescens pepper of any significance is Tabasco. The Tabasco pepper is difficult to cross with C. annuum types. Hot peppers may belong to any of above species and others. The C. chinense varieties Habanero and Scotch Bonnet are considered the hottest. \n The interest in peppers extends to their nutritive and medicinal value in that peppers are a recognized source of Vitamins C and E and are high in antioxidants. These compounds are associated with prevention of cardiovascular disorders, cancers, and cataracts. \n Peppers are a warm-season crop and need a long season for maximum production. Temperature has a large effect on the rate of plant and fruit growth and the development and quality of the red or yellow pigments. Ideal temperature for red pigment development is between 65 and 75 F. Above this range the red color becomes yellowish, and below it color development slows dramatically and stops completely below 55 F. \n Many excellent pepper varieties are available. Test several and select the ones that do well under your production system, and meets your market needs. \n Pacific Northwest pepper growers may improve their chances for successful pepper production by using raised beds ( to improve drainage), by using plastic mulches (to warm the soil and control weeds), and drip irrigation (to promote uniform moisture and fertilizer delivery), and by staking plants (to reduce plant breakage and disease -- improves air movement). These practices are especially important when the goal is to produce colored peppers (red, yellow, orange etc.) which have greater quality requirements and higher values, and take longer to mature (see appropriate sections below). \n VARIETIES \n See the Vegetable Variety Selection Resources page to find varieties that have been shown to perform well in the Pacific NW.  \n ETHEPHON FOR COLORED PEPPERS \n When colored peppers are desired, a foliar spray of ethephon (Ethrel) may be used to promote early, uniform ripening and coloring, or to ripen the partially ripe fruit remaining at the end of the harvest season. The effectiveness of Ethephon is highly dependent on ambient temperature. Check the Ethephon label for complete instructions and regulations. \n Plant size and the cover provided the fruit is important in reducing risk from sunburn. This risk may also be reduced by selecting plant population density and row spacings that allow for good fruit cover. \n HOT PEPPERS AND PUNGENCY RATINGS \n The most common sensory method to determine pungency in peppers has been an organoleptic test (Scoville, a dilution-taste procedure) with results expressed as Scoville Heat Units (SHU). The validity and accuracy of it have been widely criticized. The American Spice Trade Association and the International Organization for Standardization have adopted a modified version. The American Society for Testing and Materials is considering other organoleptic tests (the Gillett method) and a number of chemical tests to assay for capsaicinoids involved in pungency. Still, the values obtained by the various tests are often related to Scoville Heat Units.

They are also the main ingredients in tahini (sesame seed paste) and the wonderful Middle Eastern sweet call halvah.  They are available throughout the year. \n Sesame seeds may be the oldest condiment known to man.  They are highly valued for their oil which is exceptionally resistant to rancidity. \"Open sesame\"—the famous phrase from the Arabian Nights—reflects the distinguishing feature of the sesame seed pod, which bursts open when it reaches maturity.

In addition to these important nutrients, sesame seeds contain two unique substances: sesamin and sesamolin. Both of these substances belong to a group of special beneficial fibers called lignans, and have been shown to have a cholesterol-lowering effect in humans, and to prevent high blood pressure and increase vitamin E supplies in animals. Sesamin has also been found to protect the liver from oxidative damage. \n Rich In Beneficial Minerals \n Sesame seeds are an excellent source of copper, a very good source of manganese, and a good source of magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, iron, zinc, molybdenum, and selenium. This rich assortment of minerals translates into the following health benefits: \n Copper Provides Relief for Rheumatoid Arthritis \n Copper is known for its use in reducing some of the pain and swelling of rheumatoid arthritis. Copper's effectiveness is due to the fact that this trace mineral is important in a number of antiinflammatory and antioxidant enzyme systems. In addition, copper plays an important role in the activity of lysyl oxidase, an enzyme needed for the cross-linking of collagen and elastin—the ground substances that provide structure, strength and elasticity in blood vessels, bones and joints. \n Magnesium Supports Vascular and Respiratory Health \n Studies have supported magnesium's usefulness in: \n Preventing the airway spasm in asthma \n Lowering high blood pressure, a contributing factor in heart attack, stroke, and diabetic heart disease \n Preventing the trigeminal blood vessel spasm that triggers migraine attacks \n Restoring normal sleep patterns in women who are experiencing unpleasant symptoms associated with menopause \n Calcium Helps Prevent Colon Cancer, Osteoporosis, Migraine and PMS \n In recent studies, calcium has been shown to: \n Help protect colon cells from cancer-causing chemicals \n Help prevent the bone loss that can occur as a result of menopause or certain conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis \n Help prevent migraine headaches in those who suffer from them \n Reduce PMS symptoms during the luteal phase (the second half) of the menstrual cycle \n There is a little bit of controversy about sesame seeds and calcium, because there is a substantial difference between the calcium content of hulled versus unhulled sesame seeds.

About Near Field CommunicationAbout Near Field Communication \n Blog \n About Near Field Communication \n Near field communication, abbreviated NFC, is a form of contactless communication between devices like smartphones or tablets. Contactless communication allows a user to wave the smartphone over a NFC compatible device to send information without needing to touch the devices together or go through multiple steps setting up a connection. Fast and convenient, NFC technology is popular in parts of Europe and Asia, and is quickly spreading throughout the United States. \n Near field communication maintains interoperability between different wireless communication methods like Bluetooth and other NFC standards including FeliCa -- popular in Japan -- through the NFC Forum. Founded in 2004 by Sony, Nokia, and Philips, the forum enforces strict standards that manufacturers must meet when designing NFC compatible devices. This ensures that NFC is secure and remains easy-to-use with different versions of the technology. Compatibility is the key to the growth of NFC as a popular payment and data communication method. It must be able to communicate with other wireless technologies and be able to interact with different types of NFC transmissions. \n The technology behind NFC allows a device, known as a reader, interrogator, or active device, to create a radio frequency current that communicates with another NFC compatible device or a small NFC tag holding the information the reader wants. Passive devices, such as the NFC tag in smart posters, store information and communicate with the reader but do not actively read other devices. Peer-to-peer communication through two active devices is also a possibility with NFC. This allows both devices to send and receive information. \n Both businesses and individuals benefit from near field communication technology. By integrating credit cards, subway tickets, and paper coupons all into one device, a customer can board a train, pay for groceries, redeem coupons or store loyalty points, and even exchange contact information all with the wave of a smartphone. Faster transaction times mean less waiting in line and happier customers. Fewer physical cards to carry around means the customer is less likely to lose one or have it stolen. \n Who's currently in on the action with NFC technology and mobile payments? Google has launched Google Wallet that supports MasterCard PayPass, PayPal offers money transfers between smartphones, and other companies are expected to follow suit. As the technology grows, more NFC compatible smartphones will be available and more stores will offer NFC card readers for customer convenience.

Most Subaru models have used the Symmetrical All Wheel Drive drive-train layout since 1972. The flat/boxer engine and all-wheel-drive became standard equipment for mid-size and smaller cars in most international markets by 1996, and is now standard in most North American market Subaru vehicles. The lone exception is the BRZ, introduced in 2012, which uses the boxer engine but instead uses a rear-wheel-drive structure. Subaru also offers turbocharged versions of their passenger cars, such as the Impreza WRX and the Legacy 2.5GT. The 2.5XT trims of the Outback and Forester also include a turbocharged engine. \n In Western markets, the Subaru brand has traditionally been popular among a dedicated core of buyers. Marketing is targeted towards a specific niche centered on those who desire the company's signature drive train.  \n Subaru is the Japanese name for the Pleiades star cluster M45, or \"The Seven Sisters\" (one of whom tradition says is invisible – hence only six stars in the Subaru logo), which in turn inspires the logo and alludes to the companies that merged to create FHI.  \n History \n Fuji Heavy Industries started out as The Aircraft Research Laboratory in 1915, headed by Chikuhei Nakajima. In 1932, the company was reorganized as Nakajima Aircraft Company, Ltd and soon became a major manufacturer of aircraft for Japan during World War II. At the end of the Second World War Nakajima Aircraft was again reorganized, this time as Fuji Sangyo Co, Ltd. In 1946, the company created the Fuji Rabbit motor scooter with spare aircraft parts from the war.  In 1950, Fuji Sangyo was divided into 12 smaller corporations according to the Japanese Government's 1950 Corporate Credit Rearrangement Act, anti-zaibatsu legislation. Between 1953 and 1955, four of these corporations and a newly formed corporation decided to merge to form Fuji Heavy Industries. These companies were: Fuji Kogyo, a scooter manufacturer; coachbuilders Fuji Jidosha; engine manufacturers Omiya Fuji Kogyo; chassis builders Utsunomiya Sharyo and the Tokyo Fuji Dangyo trading company.  \n Kenji Kita, CEO of Fuji Heavy Industries at the time, wanted the new company to be involved in car manufacturing and soon began plans for building a car with the development code-name P-1. Mr. Kita canvassed the Company for suggestions about naming the P1, but none of the proposals was appealing enough. In the end he gave the car a Japanese name that he had \"been cherishing in his heart\": Subaru, which is the name of the Pleiades star cluster in Japanese. The first Subaru car was named the Subaru 1500.  Only twenty P1s were manufactured owing to multiple supply issues. From 1954 to 2008 the company designed and manufactured dozens of vehicles including the 1500 (1954), the tiny air-cooled 360 (1958), the Sambar (1961), the 1000 (which saw the introduction of the Subaru boxer engine in 1965), the R-2 (1969), the Rex and the Leone (1971), the BRAT (1978), Alcyone (1985), the Legacy (1989), the Impreza (1993), the Forester (1997), the Tribeca (2005), the Exiga (2008), and the BRZ (2012). \n Major shareholders \n Nissan acquired a 20.4% stake in Fuji Heavy Industries, Subaru's parent company, in 1968 during a period of government-ordered merging of the Japanese auto industry in order to improve competitiveness under the administration of Prime Minister Eisaku Sato.

The city is located on the island of montreal, which took its name from the same source as the city and a few much smaller Peripheral Island, the largest of which is Ile Bizard. Ile Bizard is an island near the island of Montreal in the Hochelaga Archipelago region. Historically named IIe Bonaventure by 1723 it had come to be named lle Bizard, after Jacques Bizard, to whom it was conceded as a Tieft in 1678. Evidence demonstrates that various nomadic First Nations native people occupied the island of Montreal for at least 2,000 years before the arrival of Europeans.

He is a very popular exhibit at the National Railway Museum and is very well looked after. It is 1 of 6 surviving A4s. \n Contents \n [ show ] \n Bio \n Mallard was built on 3 March 1938, at Doncaster, where his cousins Gordon , Flying Scotsman , Green Arrow , and Flying Thistle were built as well as his brother, Spencer . On the 3rd of July that year, while undergoing tests, he established a world speed record of 126 mph. He was renumbered to 22 by Edward Thompson's number scheme in 1946, then E22 in the Locomotive Exchange Trials and finally to 60022 in British Railways days. \n After the decline of steam, Mallard was immediately preserved and put on display at the Museum of British Transport in Clapham, London. In 1975 he was taken to the National Railway Museum, where he sat until 1986, when he was overhauled and taken onto the main line. In 1988, the 50th anniversary of his record, he was retired and put back on display. He hasn't run since. \n It was announced in March 2010 that Mallard was to be moved to Locomotion, the National Railway Museum in Shildon, on 23 June 2010. He was pulled by the brand new steam locomotive Tornado; his departure from the museum was a result of the planned redevelopment of the NRM's Great Hall, which was cancelled due to unsuccessful funding. \n Mallard returned to York in July 2011. He was due to travel to the DB Museum in Nuremberg, Germany for a speed exhibition later in the year, but due to expenses, the event was cancelled.

{"question": "What word makes new words as a prefix with the words cover, line, code and ship?", "answers": ["hard"], "context": "Line codeIn telecommunication, a line code is a code chosen for use within a communications system for transmitting a digital signal down a line. Line coding is often used for digital data transport.  Some line codes are digital baseband modulation or digital baseband transmission methods, and these are baseband line codes that are used when the line can carry DC components. \n Line coding  \n Line coding consists of representing the digital signal to be transported, by a waveform that is optimally tuned for the specific properties of the physical channel (and of the receiving equipment). The pattern of voltage, current or photons used to represent the digital data on a transmission link is called line encoding. The common types of line encoding are unipolar, polar, bipolar, and Manchester encoding. \n For reliable clock recovery at the receiver, one usually imposes a maximum run length constraint on the generated channel sequence, i.e., the maximum number of consecutive ones or zeros is bounded to a reasonable number. A clock period is recovered by observing transitions in the received sequence, so that a maximum run length guarantees such clock recovery, while sequences without such a constraint could seriously hamper the detection quality. \n After line coding, the signal is put through a \"physical channel\", either a \"transmission medium\" or \"data storage medium\".   \n Sometimes the characteristics of two very different-seeming channels are similar enough that the same line code is used for them. The most common physical channels are: \n * the line-coded signal can directly be put on a transmission line, in the form of variations of the voltage or current (often using differential signaling). \n * the line-coded signal (the \"baseband signal\") undergoes further pulse shaping (to reduce its frequency bandwidth) and then modulated (to shift its frequency) to create an \"RF signal\" that can be sent through free space. \n * the line-coded signal can be used to turn on and off a light source in free-space optical communication, most commonly used in an infrared remote control. \n * the line-coded signal can be printed on paper to create a bar code. \n * the line-coded signal can be converted to magnetized spots on a hard drive or tape drive. \n * the line-coded signal can be converted to pits on an optical disc. \n Some of the more common or binary line codes include: \n Each line code has advantages and disadvantages. The particular line code used is chosen to meet one or more of the following criteria: \n * Minimize transmission hardware \n * Facilitate synchronization \n * Ease error detection and correction \n * Minimize spectral content \n * Eliminate a dc component \n Disparity  \n The disparity of a bit pattern is the difference in the number of one bits vs the number of zero bits. The running disparity is the running total of the disparity of all previously transmitted words.  \n Unfortunately, most long-distance communication channels cannot transport a DC component. The DC component is also called the disparity, the bias, or the DC coefficient. The simplest possible line code, unipolar, gives too many errors on such systems, because it has an unbounded DC component. \n Most line codes eliminate the DC component such codes are called DC-balanced, zero-DC, DC-free, zero-bias, DC equalized, etc. \n There are three ways of eliminating the DC component: \n * Use a constant-weight code. In other words, each transmitted code word is corrected such that every code word that contains some positive or negative levels also contains enough of the opposite levels, such that the average level over each code word is zero. For example, Manchester code and Interleaved 2 of 5. \n * Use a paired disparity code. In other words, the transmitter has to make sure that every code word that averages to a negative level is paired with another code word that averages to a positive level. Therefore, it must keep track of the running DC buildup, and always pick the code word that pushes the DC level back towards zero.

{"question": "What animal is traditionally seen in the branding of Fox's Glacier Mints?", "answers": ["polar bear"], "context": "Fox's Glacier MintsFox's Glacier Mints are the leading, branded boiled mint in the UK. They have been manufactured by Fox's Confectionery in Leicester since 1918. The mints were developed by Eric Fox, one of the original founders of Fox's Confectionery. Since 1922 the mints have been sold with the Peppy the polar bear icon. Peppy is typically depicted as though standing on one of the mints. Glacier Mints resemble miniature blocks of ice and are clear and translucent. Companion products are Fox's Glacier Fruits and Fox's Glacier Dark. \n There is no connection with Fox Glacier in New Zealand.  On Impulse - Packaging TodayOn Impulse - Packaging Today \n On Impulse \n 4 December 2002 \n Competition in the confectionery market has reached boiling point and is forcing the big brands to provide added value to their products and the packaging in which they come. Today, the impulse purchase sector and promotions play a far more significant role in developing brand loyalty. Rodney Abbott  reports \n Do you remember those happy carefree childhood days when you spent your hard-saved pennies or shillings on sweets at the corner shop? I do and I am going back over half a century – which is why I refer to pennies and shillings. Even then the shopkeeper's display was sufficiently expansive to keep my mind occupied for several minutes before I could make up my mind exactly what I wanted to buy. \n Today, supermarkets and specialist confectioners, even confectionists tobaconistsand news agents, offer a mind boggling array of products that makes it almost impossible to finalise a choice without undertaking an inventory. The battle for brand supremacy is fierce and the confectionery supplier has to find increasingly innovative and cost-effective pack and marketing concepts to move products off the shelf. \n According to market analysts Nielsen, the sugar confectionery market [mints, fruits, gums, traditional sweets etc.] is worth £1036M. The mint market alone is worth £146M and the fruits market is worth a massive £378M. Both of those markets have been growing at 1% and 4%, respectively, over the last year. \n I sought timely refuge at one of the most British of confectionery suppliers – Leicester-based Fox's – which is so proud of its 105-year old heritage. \n Mind you, the company has seen some changes in it's history, having been taken over by Rowntree, Nestlé and, more recently, Northern Foods which has just acquired Paynes – renown for its Poppets and Just Brazils. \n Since the arrival of Northern Foods, the company has not let the grass grow under its feet. \n Since the start of the year, it has put Fox's back on TV and undertaken various on pack promotions. Last month, it relaunched the brand in a bid to take it forward. \n I asked brand manager Emma Gilbert to explain the reasoning behind the relaunch, which was preceded by careful market research with small but focused consumer groups through packaging designers Siebert Head. \n \"Loyal consumers – adults aged 35 and above – allied Fox's with Glacier Mints, a strong brand name. While they recognised the mint as a quality product, they didn't think that the former packaging reflected that quality and heritage of the brand. \n \"In fact, the research disclosed that the three basic elements of the branding were almost disjointed, all fighting for the consumer's attention. Above the image of Peppy the famous polar bear was the brand Fox's. Below Peppy were the words Glacier Mints. While the image of Peppy was regarded as important, even more key was the brand name 'Fox's'.\" \n Fox's Glacier Fruits were less well known than the mint, even though the brand has been around since the middle 50s and consumers were saying that they wanted added value from the fruits. \"The product just didn't stand out from other products on the market,\" admitted Emma. \n Armed with this information Fox's added real fruit juice, took out artificial colours and followed market trends to provide products with added benefits. \n Since the majority of consumers said that their favourite sweets were either strawberry or blackcurrant flavoured, Fox's has also created a new product", "parametric_answer": "fox", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom and Germany.  The largest and most important cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, The Hague and Rotterdam. Amsterdam is the country's capital,  while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament.  The port of Rotterdam is the largest port in Europe – as large as the next three largest combined – and was the world's largest port between 1962 and 2004.  The name Holland is also frequently used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. \n \"Netherlands\" literally means \"lower countries\", influenced by its low land and flat geography, with only about 50% of its land exceeding one metre above sea level.  Most of the areas below sea level are man-made. Since the late 16th century, large areas (polders) have been reclaimed from the sea and lakes, amounting to nearly 17% of the country's current land mass. With a population density of 408 people per km2 – 505 (July 2016) if water is excluded – the Netherlands is a very densely populated country. Only Bangladesh, South Korea, and Taiwan have both a larger population and a higher population density. Nevertheless, the Netherlands is the world's second-largest exporter of food and agricultural products, after the United States.   This is partly due to the fertility of the soil and the mild climate. The Netherlands was the third country in the world to have an elected parliament, and since 1848 it has been governed as a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, organised as a unitary state. The Netherlands has a long history of social tolerance and is generally regarded as a liberal country, having legalised abortion, prostitution and euthanasia, while maintaining a progressive drugs policy. In 2001, it became the world's first country to legalise same-sex marriage. \n The Netherlands is a founding member of the EU, Eurozone, G-10, NATO, OECD and WTO, and a part of the trilateral Benelux Union. The country is host to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and five international courts: the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Court and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. The first four are situated in The Hague, as is the EU's criminal intelligence agency Europol and judicial co-operation agency Eurojust. This has led to the city being dubbed \"the world's legal capital\".  The Netherlands is also a part of the Schengen Area. The Netherlands has a market-based mixed economy, ranking 17th of 177 countries according to the Index of Economic Freedom.  It had the thirteenth-highest per capita income in the world in 2013 according to the International Monetary Fund. In 2013, the United Nations World Happiness Report ranked the Netherlands as the seventh-happiest country in the world, reflecting its high quality of life.  \n Etymology \n The Netherlands in its entirety is often referred to by the much older designation \"Holland\" (meaning holt land, or wood land), though this refers only to North and South Holland, two of the nation's twelve provinces, formerly a single province and earlier the County of Holland. This originally Frankish county emerged from the dissolved Frisian Kingdom and was, after the decline of Brabant, economically and politically the most important county in the region. Because of this importance and the emphasis on Holland during the Anglo-Dutch Wars in the 17th and 18th century, Holland served as a pars pro toto for the entire country in English, and is considered either incorrect,   informal,  or on occasion opprobrious, depending on the context, but is more acceptable when referring to the national", "parametric_answer": "china", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

It may have come from the Latin pix meaning “pitch” or Greek pitta, but others say that it originated in a Langobardic  word bizzo meaning “bite.” \n Where did the dish itself emerge? The common belief is that Italians invented pizza, but a baked bread with toppings has many other precursors in other cuisines. Italy’s version of the dish, especially from Naples, is the one we are most familiar with, though pissaladière from Provence, coca from Catalan, and lahma bi ajeen from the Middle East all bear a remarkable resemblance to pizza. \n Supposedly, this archetypal pizza, an open-faced pie slathered in tomato sauce and mozzarella, was ushered in by the baker Raffaele Esposito in Naples. In 1889, he made a patriotic pie topped with mozzarella, basil, and tomatoes, ingredients the colors of the Italian flag, in honor of King Umberto and Queen Margherita’s visit. It is rumored the Queen enjoyed the pie, and thus, it became known as a Margherita. \n In the US, Italian immigrants sold pizza in their stores, and the first pizzeria was opened in 1905 by Gennaro Lombardi at 53 1/3 Spring Street in New York City, but pizza did not truly not catch on stateside until World War II. Stationed in Italy, many American and European soldiers tasted pizza, and brought an appetite for this now-ubiquitous dish home with them. \n Where’s your favorite slice from?

As we cannot know the date when the first pizza was invented ,we can only speculate who invented pizza. \n Pizza, as we know it today, is a bread crust covered with a tomato base and then flavored with other toppings. Yet tomatoes did not appear on European menus until the Sixteenth Century, when they were brought over from the New World by the Spanish conquistadors. Pizza as we know it today, with a crust, tomato and other toppings, was even later in history; it did not originate until the eighteenth Century in Naples . \n Italian folklore claims that the first pizza was Italian, and it is certain that in ancient times the ancient Greeks and Romans had a type of unleavened bread, topped with a flavor before being baked. We know from historical writings that the Greek pizza was merely vegetables, but the origin of the pizza in Italy was more sophisticated. It was topped with pork scraps, olives and the sweet desserts with honey, raisins and pine nuts. Some of those sweet dessert pizza recipes have been enshrined in pizza history and are still used in Italy today. \n Italian pizza history \n The precise history of the pizza and its origin will never be known, but here is what we know about the Italian pizza history: \n The history of pizza goes back to the time of Virgil, who died in the first Century BC, but not before writing down a pizza recipe for posterity. \n Around 1000 AD the word �picea� started to appear in historical records in Italy , it was a circle of dough and the topped with a variety of fillings then baked.

Although the saeta is not strictly flamenco, it has all the spontaneity of flamenco, and has been added to the flamenco repertoire of many jondo singers. \n Cante jondo means “deep song,” and these are the styles of which most of the other forms derive. \n Flamenco is made up of four elements, Cante-Voice, Baile-Dance, Toque-Guitar, and the Jaleo, which roughly translated means “hell raising” and involves the handclapping, foot stomping, and shouts of encouragement. \n It whichever way jaleo presents itself, it is performed by the audience as well as the artiste and anyone else who feels the urge to participate. \n The handclapping or Palmas is an art in itself, and although it may look easy, it is not, and the palmeros will weave intricate rhythms around the bases of the song, and in the tablaos this is used in conjunction with the zapateado. \n The zapateado is the tap dance style of footwork, the dancers show piece where he will demonstrate his skill with his feet, and the noise created by this and the palmeros will be ringing in your ears long after you have left the tablao. \n The addition of the guitar is surrounded in apparent mystery as the exact date is not known, but gradually the guitar was introduced as an accompanying instrument for flamenco. \n Another important component of flamenco is the element known as duende, and this is shrouded in as much mystery as flamenco itself. \n Writers and poets over the years have given duende a magical and mysterious \n meaning, a spiritual significance that goes beyond human understanding. \n The poet Federico Garcia Lorca romanticized duende saying, “Duende could only be present when one sensed that death possible.” \n Many will say that duende can only be experienced in certain surroundings like an intimate flamenco session where a singer will be possessed by the dark tones of the song and the spirit will enter the mind and soul of anyone who opens up to it. \n “Duende a strange presence that everybody senses but no philosopher can explain ,” or, “All that has dark sounds has duende.” \n What ever you believe, duende does exist, and to experience it, is one of the wonders of this mystical art. \n Many believe flamenco to be the invention of the gypsies, and although they have been the main protagonists of the art, they are not its sole creators. \n Flamenco song can be broken down into two categories- Cante gitano, gypsy songs, and Cante andaluz, andalucian songs. \n When the gypsies arrived in Andalucia from India around 1425, they brought with them many song and dance styles that have strong Indian connections.

{"question": "\"\"\"Serpula Lacrymans\"\" is the technical name for which decay of seasoned timber caused by a fungi that consume the cellulose of wood, leaving a soft skeleton which is readily reduced to powder ?\"", "answers": ["dry rot"], "context": "Serpula lacrymansSerpula lacrymans is one of the fungi that causes damage to timber referred to as dry rot. It is a basidiomycete in the order Boletales. \n Taxonomy \n The species was first described under the name Boletus lacrymans by Franz Xavier von Wulfen in 1781. It was transferred to the genus Serpula by Petter Karsten in 1884. \n The specific epithet is derived from the Latin words serpula for \"creeping\" (as in a serpent) and lacrymans, meaning \"making tears\". \n Environment \n Serpula lacrymans has a preference for temperatures of 21 to but can survive any temperature from 3 to. It is not clear how much light is needed to promote Serpula lacrymans growth. In terms of aeration Serpula lacrymans often grows near ventilation shafts which shows a preference for concentrated oxygen. A moisture content of 30 to 40 percent is its ideal level in wood to promote fruit body formation. It appears that Serpula lacrymans requires an environment where both inorganic and organic materials are present. The fungus uses calcium and iron ions extracted from plaster, brick, and stone to aid the breakdown of wood, which results in brown rot. \n Distribution \n Although it is a common indoor biodeterioration agent, it has only been found in a few natural environments, the Himalayas, Northern California, the Czech Republic and east Asia. A recent study on the evolutionary origin and spread of this species using genetic markers (amplified fragment length polymorphisms, DNA sequences and microsatellites) on a worldwide sample of specimens suggested the existence of two main lineages, a nonaggressive lineage found in North America, and an aggressive lineage found on all continents, both in natural environments and buildings. \n Impact on structures \n Serpula lacrymans is considered to be the most damaging destroyer of indoor wood construction materials in temperate regions. \n \"In the United Kingdom alone, money spent by building owners rectifying damage caused by dry rot was at least 150 million pounds per annum.\"  LumberLumber (American English;  timber in Australian English, British English, Hiberno-English, and New Zealand English ) is wood that has been processed into beams and planks, a stage in the process of wood production. \n Lumber may be supplied either rough-sawn, or surfaced on one or more of its faces. Besides pulpwood, rough lumber is the raw material for furniture-making and other items requiring additional cutting and shaping. It is available in many species, usually hardwoods; but it is also readily available in softwoods, such as white pine and red pine, because of their low cost.  Finished lumber is supplied in standard sizes, mostly for the construction industry—primarily softwood, from coniferous species, including pine, fir and spruce (collectively spruce-pine-fir), cedar, and hemlock, but also some hardwood, for high-grade flooring. \n Lumber is mainly used for structural purposes but has many other uses as well. It is classified more commonly as a softwood than as a hardwood, because 80% of lumber comes from softwood.  \n Terminology \n In Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and Britain, the term timber describes sawn wood products, such as floor boards. In the United States and Canada, generally timber describes standing or felled trees, before they are milled into boards, which are called lumber. \n Timber there  also describes sawn lumber not less than 5 inches (127 mm) in its smallest dimension.  The latter includes the often partly finished lumber used in timber-frame construction. \n In the United Kingdom, the word lumber is rarely used in relation to wood, and timber is almost universally used in its place; but lumber has several other meanings in Britain, including unused or unwanted items. \n Remanufactured lumber \n Remanufactured lumber is the result of secondary or tertiary processing/cutting of previously milled lumber. Specifically, it is lumber cut for industrial or wood-packaging use. Lumber is cut by ripsaw or resaw to create dimensions that are not usually processed by a primary sawmill. \n Resawing is the splitting of 1-inch through 12-inch hardwood or softwood lumber into two or more thinner pieces of full-length boards.

{"question": "What language was first to be represented in dictionaries and related language theory?", "answers": ["chineſe", "chinese"], "context": "LanguageLanguage is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. \n Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky. \n Estimates of the number of languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000. However, any precise estimate depends on a partly arbitrary distinction between languages and dialects. Natural languages are spoken or signed, but any language can be encoded into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli – for example, in whistling, signed, or braille. This is because human language is modality-independent. Depending on philosophical perspectives regarding the definition of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, \"language\" may refer to the cognitive ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules. All languages rely on the process of semiosis to relate signs to particular meanings. Oral and sign languages contain a phonological system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or morphemes, and a syntactic system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances. \n Human language has the properties of productivity, recursivity, and displacement, and relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of animal communication. Language is thought to have originated when early hominins started gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to form a theory of other minds and a shared intentionality.   This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the human brain, but especially in Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Humans acquire language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently when they are approximately three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched in human culture. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group identity, social stratification, as well as social grooming and entertainment. \n Languages evolve and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family. The Indo-European family is the most widely spoken and includes languages such as English, Russian, and Hindi; the Sino-Tibetan family, which includes Mandarin and the other Chinese languages, and Tibetan; the Afro-Asiatic family, which includes Arabic, Somali, and Hebrew; the Bantu languages, which include Swahili, and Zulu, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout Africa; and the Malayo-Polynesian languages, which include Indonesian, Malay, Tagalog, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout the Pacific. The languages of the Dravidian family that are spoken mostly in Southern India include Tamil and Telugu.  Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of the 21st century will probably have become extinct by the year 2100. \n Definitions \n The English word language derives ultimately from Proto-Indo-European  \"tongue, speech, language\" through Latin lingua, \"language; tongue\", and Old French language.  The word is sometimes used to refer to codes, ciphers, and other kinds of artificially constructed communication systems such as formally defined computer languages used for computer programming", "parametric_answer": "latin", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

She achieved unprecedented success with her Callanetics exercises. Her 9 books all became international best-sellers and the video series that followed went on to sell over 6 million copies. Pinckney's first video release \"Callanetics: 10 Years Younger In 10 Hours\" outsold every other fitness video in the US. Within 3 years it had pushed Jane Fonda into second place on the all-time individual best-selling fitness video chart and it remains the all-time fitness bestseller in both the US and UK.  \n Early life \n Pinckney was born on September 26, 1939. Born as Barbara Biffinger Pfeiffer Pinckney, she grew up in Savannah, Georgia in the deep south of the United States. Going back nine generations her family were instrumental in founding South Carolina. They were explorers and adventurers and even helped draft the Constitution of United States. She was born with spinal curvatures, one hip higher than the other and severely turned-in feet. She was forced to wear leg braces for seven years and in an effort to correct her alignment spent the next decade studying classical ballet. She rebelled against her upbringing, got suspended from every school she attended and spent her days dreaming of traveling and exploring the world. \n Eleven years around the world \n By the time she reached 21, Pinckney had become increasingly bored and restless with her well-bred southern lifestyle. Her adventurous ancestry was bringing out the traveller in her and after two years of college she felt the time had come for a major change. Her father had always insisted that she finish college before she even considered traveling abroad. He was sure that she could not live without his support for more than a couple of months. This only made Callan more determined to strike out on her own. She wanted to see foreign lands and experience life and people. No college education could offer her that, so she planned her escape one morning in 1961. As the sun was rising she grabbed her passport and threw her tightly packed suitcase from the second- story window of her parent’s home. She climbed out after it and ran across the street to a waiting car. She jumped in and asked her friends to drive her to the bus depot. From there she headed for Wilmington in North Carolina. Pinckney knew there was a freighter leaving for Germany that day and without a second thought she stepped on board and started her adventure. \n Pinckney didn’t know what to expect when she arrived in Bremerhaven, West Germany. She had no particular plans. Her dream was to see the world. For nearly a year Callan travelled across Europe. Her home was an old Volkswagen that she borrowed from a friend. Sleeping in it meant she could save money to prolong her travels. She took odd jobs whenever she needed and truly immersed herself in the culture and lifestyle of the country she was in. \n When Pinckney reached London, winter was approaching. Without a work permit, the only jobs she could get were hard manual labour. She would shovel coal and snow for eight hours for little more than $3 a day. And with no central heating in her apartment she would eat digestive biscuits with jam and copious amounts of starchy food to insulate her body in fat. To keep herself warm and awake whilst working she would get through 40 cups of heavily sugared tea each day. When Pinckney left the US she weighed 105 lb. Within a few months of reaching London her weight had pushed up to 129 lb. With her petite frame and at a height of only 5’1” her body was really starting to suffer. \n Pinckney started exploring the possibility of leaving Europe and travelling further afield. She had heard people in London talking about Africa and she set her heart on visiting there next.

Here at the farm, we love an evening with a tasty raclette. \n image by rachelinlux.com \n   \n Raclette is a semi firm meltable cow’s milk cheese that has given its name to a time-honored meal born in the mountains of Switzerland. Historically, Swiss cow herders would take a wheel of raclette with them when moving cows to and from the mountain pastures. Around the evening camp fire, they would place a part of the wheel close to the fire and, when it reached the perfect softness, scrape the melted layer onto bread for a nourishing, warm meal. (The term raclette derives from the French word racler, meaning “to scrape,”) \n At the home hearth, a cheese wheel is cut in half or quarters, depending on the number of guests, and placed with its face close to the fire so it begins to soften and melt. The melted cheese is scraped from the wheel onto plates and served, traditionally, with bread, small firm potatoes, tiny gherkins, pickled onions, and cured meats. \n In Switzerland, raclette was typically served with tea or other warm beverages. However a dry fruity white wine, such as the traditional Savoy wine, a Reisling or Pinot Gris is also a good match. (Take note that local lore cautions that other drinks, water for example, will cause the cheese to harden in the stomach, leading to indigestion. So they say.) \n For the hearth-less, there are small electric table-top grills with small trays for melting the slices of cheese. Generally the grill is placed over a hot plate or griddle that will keep the cheese warm.

{"question": "Hewer is an old occupational name for which trade?", "answers": ["miners", "miner"], "context": "HewerA hewer ( or Häuer) is a miner who loosens rock and minerals in a mine. In medieval mining in Europe a Hauer was the name given to a miner who had passed his test (Hauerprüfung) as a hewer.  \n Training  \n In Europe in former times, before he could become a hewer, the miner had to learn to be a \"sorter boy\" (Scheidejunge), identifying ores and separating the ore from the gangue. After that he would continue his training in the pit itself. Here, he had to learn further skills, initially as a putter (Hundtstößer literally \"truck pusher\"), transporting material around the mine in wagons. Only afterwards could he learn the skills, as an apprentice hewer (Lehrhäuer), that he would later need as a hewer.  This form of training, the acquisition of knowledge by experience, was practised in mining until the First World War.  \n From the 1920s, the training of hewers was legally regulated as a result of union demands. Because, in the meantime, many skills required special knowledge, other tradesmen were gradually employed in mining and in the pits: initially metalworkers and, later, electricians. Following training and passing exams, the craftsman had to gain practical experience in order to sit for his hewer examination. This comprised a theoretical and a practical element.  \n The hewer exam could be taken once the miner was 20 years old. Between his apprenticeship as a sorter boy and the exam, the trainee hewer thus had at least two years of practical experience. After passing the hewer's exam there was a \"graduation\" event (Lossprechung).  \n Hierarchy  \n An apprentice hewer was placed under a hewer and had to work under his direction. In the dressing area of the mine, old, former hewers were responsible for supervising the sorter boys. The hewer reported to the mine foreman or supervisor, the Steiger, also called the Dinghauer in some mines, or in smaller pits, the Hutmann.  \n The hewer was held in particular esteem, by the other miners in the pit, even though he actually had no authority over them. The Steiger, who were important officials in the early days of state mining, later became just ordinary employees. \n Promotion  \n Depending on diligence, skill and suitability, a hewer could be promoted to Hutmann or Steiger. Even an appointment as shift foreman (Schichtmeister), to the council of aldermen or jurates (Berggeschworenen) or as mine manager (Bergmeister) was possible.  At the end of the 18th century, pit and operational officials were legally required to undertake engineering training at a mining academy or mining school. For this reason, the training of a Steiger could no longer be carried out simply through on the job training. \n Hewers with many years of experience, the ability to lead men and who had sufficient mining and technical skills, could be promoted to the rank of supervisor (Aufsichtshauer) or senior hewer (Oberhauer). They were not, however, supervisory staff in the mining legal sense, but had the role of a team foreman. \n If a hewer proved to be particularly expert, he would be appointed as a \"master hewer\" (Meisterhauer). He was then responsible for the technical training of junior miners. For this, the master hewer, was specially trained in a preparatory course, which culminated with an in-house examination. Master hewers reported to the mining authority. \n A particularly experienced hewer who had worked for over 10 years and was at least 35 years old, could, if suitable, be appointed as a \"leading hewer\" (Fahrhauer). In order to achieve this he had to be deemed professionally suitable. His professional suitability was assessed on a so-called leading hewer's course (Fahrhauerkurs), which also acted as a certificate of proficiency. Leading hewers were responsible persons in the sense of the Federal Mining Law (Bundesberggesetz) and were given a written order of authority (Bestellschreiben).  \n Hours of work and wages  \n The working hours of the hewers varied from region to region and ranged between", "parametric_answer": "blacksmith", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

Together with two bus-loads of passengers I got my first look at the Canal from on land, thanks to an excursion that took us to the new and old Gatun locks. \n Celebrity Infinity \n A swanky visitor centre has opened months before the expanded waterway is ready to accommodate its first ships. There’s an air-conditioned cinema showing an informative film, a reasonably-priced souvenir shop, and an extensive bar and restaurant. \n The real attractions are the viewing areas; from one we saw Holland America Lines’ Zuiderdam at anchor in Gatun Lake. The ship was not making a full transit of the canal; it had entered from Colon earlier in the morning and its passengers were being tendered ashore for excursions. They would rejoin the ship back in port later in the day. \n It was a steamy, misty dawn next morning as the Infinity left the port of Colon and approached the canal entrance from Limon Bay. Three Panama pilots came on board to supervise the navigation and my fellow passengers crowded the helipad at the bow and climbed to the uppermost decks to be in prime viewing position for our entry into the first of the three Gatun locks. \n A low-tech, neon-lit arrow indicated which of the two parallel channels we should take. Two men in a tiny rowing boat made their way from the lock side delivering ropes tied to steel cables. \n It all seemed disarmingly primitive until those cables were attached to gleaming electric locomotives costing £1.2 million each. Their task was not to pull us through – ships use their own power – but to make sure the ship’s sides did not scrape against the concrete walls. A crowd of spectators taking their own turn to watch were treated to a levitation trick worthy of any David Blaine illusion; 22 million gallons of water flooded into the lock in less than 10 minutes without the need for pumps or any mechanical aid, lifting Infinity and a container ship in the second channel alongside, as if by magic. After taking more than an hour to be raised through the locks, we emerged into Gatun Lake and for the next few hours threaded our way between luxuriant islands and rainforest national parks. The wide open spaces are most un-canal-like and yet the lake, containing some of the 10 feet of rain which falls each year, is what makes the Panama Canal possible. \n By now the humid 94-degree heat was proving too much for many of the passengers, who retreated from the outer decks to the air-conditioned comfort inside Infinity. I remained on deck, transfixed by the passing scenery and some of the curiosities. \n On one bank, just past a viaduct carrying trains from the trans-Panama Railway over the water, we could see the infamous El Ranacer prison, where ex-president Manuel Noriega is held after being convicted of drug trafficking and murder. \n We entered the Culebra Cut, a gorge carved 100 years ago by dynamite and steam shovels through the mountains of the continental divide.

Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), affect the energy balance of the global atmosphere in ways expected to lead to an overall increase in global average temperature, known as global warming (see also greenhouse effect ). According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , established by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization in 1988, the long-term effects of global warming would include a general rise in sea level around the world, resulting in the inundation of low-lying coastal areas and the possible disappearance of some island states; the melting of glaciers , sea ice , and Arctic permafrost ; an increase in the number of extreme climate -related events, such as floods and droughts , and changes in their distribution; and an increased risk of extinction for 20 to 30 percent of all plant and animal species. The Kyoto Protocol committed most of the Annex I signatories to the UNFCCC (consisting of members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and several countries with “economies in transition”) to mandatory emission-reduction targets, which varied depending on the unique circumstances of each country. Other signatories to the UNFCCC and the protocol, consisting mostly of developing countries, were not required to restrict their emissions. The protocol entered into force in February 2005, 90 days after being ratified by at least 55 Annex I signatories that together accounted for at least 55 percent of total carbon dioxide emissions in 1990. \n Similar Topics \n Good Friday Agreement \n The protocol provided several means for countries to reach their targets. One approach was to make use of natural processes, called “sinks,” that remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The planting of trees, which take up carbon dioxide from the air, would be an example. Another approach was the international program called the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which encouraged developed countries to invest in technology and infrastructure in less-developed countries, where there were often significant opportunities to reduce emissions. Under the CDM, the investing country could claim the effective reduction in emissions as a credit toward meeting its obligations under the protocol. An example would be an investment in a clean-burning natural gas power plant to replace a proposed coal-fired plant. A third approach was emissions trading , which allowed participating countries to buy and sell emissions rights and thereby placed an economic value on greenhouse gas emissions. European countries initiated an emissions-trading market as a mechanism to work toward meeting their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. Countries that failed to meet their emissions targets would be required to make up the difference between their targeted and actual emissions, plus a penalty amount of 30 percent, in the subsequent commitment period, beginning in 2012; they would also be prevented from engaging in emissions trading until they were judged to be in compliance with the protocol.

In British English, the term jumper describes what is called a sweater in American English. Also, in more formal British usage, a distinction is made between a pinafore dress and a pinafore. The latter, though a related garment, has an open back and is worn as an apron. In American English, pinafore always refers to an apron. \n A sundress, like a jumper, is sleeveless and collarless; however, such articles are not worn over a blouse or sweater, and are of distinctly different cuts and fashions. The apron dress may be viewed as a special case of the jumper. If the design of the dress is directly inspired by an apron (having a bib in front and ties in the back, for example), the garment is typically described as an apron dress.  nouns - What's the difference between a jumper, a pullover ...nouns - What's the difference between a jumper, a pullover, and a sweater? - English Language & Usage Stack Exchange \n What's the difference between a jumper, a pullover, and a sweater? \n up vote 17 down vote favorite \n 2 \n Following on from a recent question , in Australia we have the word jumper for a knitted long-sleeved garment, typically woollen and long-sleeved. \n When cosuming foreign media I always assumed the terms pullover and sweater were the names of the same garment in either Britain or America but was never clear.

In Massekhet Soferim (10:8), a late geonic work, we read that a minyan is required for the recitation of certain prayers–but, it is added, “our Sages in Palestine recite these prayers in the presence of seven . . . and some say even in the presence of only six.” The practice of the Palestinians did not prevail, however. The rule of the Babylonian Jews was adopted everywhere, and a full quorum of ten men has been required for public prayer. \n It has also been argued whether one may include in the minyan a boy under 13 when only one person is lacking for the quorum. \n The authorities never agreed in this respect.

{"question": "Introduced in 1894 and one of the world's oldest trademarks, Bibendum is better known as what?", "answers": ["bibendum"], "context": "Michelin and the history of the Michelin-Bibendum logoMichelin and the history of the Michelin-Bibendum logo \n   \n Who or what is Michelin? \n Michelin full name: SCA Compagnie Générale des établissements Michelin, is a tyre manufacturer based in Clermont-Ferrand in the Auvergne région of France. It is one of the two largest tyre manufacturers in the world along with Bridgestone. In addition to the Michelin brand, it also owns the BFGoodrich, Taurus, Riken, Kormoran and Uniroyal (in North America) tyre brands. It is also notable for its Red and Green travel guides, its roadmaps, the Michelin stars that the Red Guide awards to restaurants for their cooking, and for its company mascot Bibendum, colloquially known as the Michelin Man. \n The Michelin logo - Bibendum \n Bibendum, commonly referred to as the Michelin Man, is the symbol of the Michelin tyre company. Introduced at the Lyon Exhibition of 1894 where the Michelin brothers had a stand, Bibendum is one of the world's oldest trademarks. The slogan Nunc est bibendum (Now is the time to drink) is taken from Horace's Odes (book I). He is also referred to as Bib or Bibelobis. \n While attending the Universal and Colonial Exposition in Lyon in 1894, Edouard and André Michelin noticed a stack of tires that suggested to Edouard the figure of a man without arms. Four years later, André met French cartoonist Marius Rossillon, popularly known as O'Galop, who showed him a rejected image he had created for Munich brewery—a large, regal figure holding a huge glass of beer and quoting Horace's phrase \"Nunc est bibendum\". André immediately suggested replacing the man with a figure made from tires. Thus O'Galop transformed the earlier image into Michelin's symbol. Today, Bibendum is one of the world's most recognised trademarks, representing Michelin in over 150 countries. \n The 1898 poster showed him offering the toast Nunc est bibendum!!.. to his scrawny competitors with a glass full of road hazards, with the title and the tag C'est à dire: À votre santé. Le pneu Michelin boit l'obstacle (\"That is to say, to your health. The Michelin tire drinks up obstacles\"). The implication is that Michelin tires will easily take on road hazards. The company used this basic poster format for fifteen years, adding its latest products to the table in front of the figure. It is unclear when the word \"Bibendum\" came to be the name of the character himself. At the latest, it was in 1908, when Michelin commissioned Curnonsky to write a newspaper column signed \"Bibendum\". \n Since 1912, tires have taken on a black appearance because carbon is added as a preservative and strengthener to the base rubber material. Before then, tires took on a gray-white or light, translucent beige colour. This helps explain why Bibendum is white, though modern tires are black. \n The name of the plump tire-man has entered the language to describe someone obese or wearing comically bulky clothing. (e.g. \"How can I wrap up warm without looking like the Michelin Man ?\") \n Bibendum's shape has changed over the years. O'Galop's logo was based on bicycle tires, wore pince-nez glasses with lanyard, and smoked a cigar. By the 1980s, Bibendum was being shown running, and in 1998, his 100th anniversary, a slimmed-down version became the company's new logo. He had long since given up the cigar and pince-nez. The slimming of the logo reflected lower-profile, smaller tires of modern cars. Bib even had a similar-looking puppy as a companion when the duo were CGI animated for recent American television advertisements. \n A history of the emblem was written by Olivier Darmon and published in 1997: Le grand siècle de Bibendum; Paris: Hoëbeke. \n    Creepy Michelin Man Evolves into Cuddly Mascot - PetroliciousCreepy Michelin Man Evolves into Cuddly Mascot • Petrolicious \n April 25, 2013 \n 1 comments \n Introduced in 1894, the Michelin Man, or Bibendum as he’s properly known, is among the world’s oldest trademarks.

One Barclays trader wrote in electronic chats: “If you aint cheating, you aint trying.” \n Barclays has fired eight employees as part of its settlement with New York’s Department of Financial Services , and has agreed a separate $115m fine with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission for manipulating ISDAfix, a dollar benchmark used to price certain financial products. \n Benjamin Lawsky, the head of the DFS, who revealed on Wednesday that he will step down from the job after four years, said: “Put simply, Barclays employees helped rig the foreign exchange market. They engaged in a brazen ‘heads I win, tails you lose’ scheme to rip off their clients.” \n The four US regulators and the FCA levied $5.7bn in fines directly for manipulating foreign exchange benchmarks. Additionally, UBS and Barclays were ordered to pay $263m to the Department of Justice because their activity violated agreements signed when the banks were fined for Libor rigging. \n Barclays, RBS, Citigroup and JP Morgan also took the unprecedented step of pleading guilty to conspiring to fix prices, while UBS, which co-operated with the US investigation, pleaded guilty to a separate charge of wire fraud related to Libor. \n The banks were accused of failings that meant their traders were able to club together to rig FX markets as late as 2013 – the year after the Libor scandal broke. Authorities said they had identified instances of market rigging occurring as early as 2007. \n Despite the huge fines, which take combined penalties over foreign exchange manipulation to $10bn, shares in the banks surged on investors’ relief that they were not larger. \n • Q&A: Why are the banks being fined for foreign exchange rigging? \n Barclays rose more than 3pc, adding £1.48bn to the bank’s value – almost as much as it was forced to pay. The bank had set aside more than £2bn in relation to the probes, while it was not judged to have breached a deferred prosecution agreement with the DoJ. \n RBS, which is 80pc owned by the taxpayer, rose 1.78pc. The bank had set aside £704m for potential fines but its penalties on Wednesday totalled just £430m. \n Barclays’ total fines related to currency rigging are the biggest out of the seven banks to have been penalised, and it is still being pursued by the DFS over potential electronic rigging of currency benchmarks. \n The regulator is investigating whether the bank’s employees set up automated systems to manipulate markets. \n “While today’s action concerns misconduct in spot trading, there is additional work ahead. The Department’s investigation of electronic foreign exchange trading – which makes up the vast majority of transactions in this market – will continue,” Mr Lawsky said. \n The DFS does not regulate the other banks involved and thus fined only Barclays, but", "parametric_answer": "libor", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

Crease well before re-opening the sheet. \n A standard 6-inch by 6-inch (15-cm by 15-cm) square of origami paper works well for this, but any size paper can be used as long as it is a perfect square with four even sides. \n When you begin, the paper should look like a diamond instead of a square. The pointed corners should face the top and bottom, not the flat edges. \n You must open the sheet of paper back up so that it returns to its original square or diamond shape before proceeding further. \n 2 \n Fold the square in half in the opposite direction. Fold the left point over so that it meets the right point. Crease the paper well before unfolding it back into its original shape. \n After this step, you should be faced with a diamond that has two perpendicular crease marks. One should go from top to bottom and the other from side to side. The two crease marks should intersect in the center of the paper. \n 3 \n Bring the top point down to the center. Fold the top of the sheet so that the top point meets the center of the paper. \n The center of the paper should be the point at which the two crease marks intersect. \n Crease the upper portion of the paper well and do not unfold. \n 4 \n Bring the bottom point up to the top edge. Fold the bottom of the paper up so that the bottom point meets the newly-created upper edge. \n Crease well and do not unfold. \n The bottom point should completely cover the folded top point. It should also meet the upper edge in the middle of the upper edge fold. \n Note that there should now be a total of six points: three on the left and three on the right. \n 5 \n Fold the right and left sides to the center crease. Fold the lowest right-hand corner up so that it meets the middle of the upper edge. Repeat this fold with the lowest left-hand corner, bringing it together with the fold made on the right. \n The bottom edge created by the previous step should now be folded in two parts that meet together above the vertical center of the paper. \n Crease both sides well and do not unfold. \n 6 \n Turn the heart over. Flip the rough heart shape over to the other side.

{"question": "Pandalus borealis is more commonly called (and officially named by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization)?", "answers": ["northern shrimp", "pandalus borealis"], "context": "Pandalus borealisPandalus borealis is a species of caridean shrimp found in cold parts of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The FAO refers to them as the northern prawn. Other common names include pink shrimp, deepwater prawn, deep-sea prawn, great northern prawn, ' and northern shrimp. \n Distribution \n P. borealis lives at depths of 20 -, usually on soft muddy bottoms,  in waters with a temperature of 0 -.  The distribution of the nominate subspecies P. b. borealis in the Atlantic ranges from New England, Canada's eastern seaboard (off Newfoundland and Labrador and eastern Baffin Island in Nunavut), southern and eastern Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard, Norway and the North Sea as far south as the English Channel. In the Pacific, P. b. eous is found from Japan, through the Sea of Okhotsk, across the Bering Strait, and as far south in North America as Washington state. \n Physiology \n In their 8-year lifespan, males can reach a length of 120 mm, while females can reach 165 mm long. \n The shrimp are hermaphroditic. They start out male, but after a year or two, their testicles turn to ovaries and they complete their lives as females.  \n Commercial fishing \n P. borealis is an important food resource, and has been widely fished since the early 1900s in Norway, and later in other countries following Johan Hjort's practical discoveries of how to locate them. In Canada, these shrimp are sold peeled, cooked and frozen in bags in supermarkets, and are consumed as appetizers. \n Northern shrimp have a short life, which contributes to a variable stock on a yearly basis. However, the species is not considered overfished due to a large amount reported and a large amount harvested. \n In Canada, the annual harvest limit is set to 164,000 tonnes (2008). The Canadian fishery began in the 1980s and expanded in 1990s. \n In 2013 the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission determined that stocks of P. borealis were too low and shut down the New England fishery. This was the first cancellation in 35 years.  \n Uses \n Beyond human consumption, shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP), an enzyme used in molecular biology, is obtained from Pandalus borealis, and the species' carapace is a source of chitosan, a versatile chemical used for such different applications as treating bleeding wounds, filtering wine or improving the soil in organic farming.

{"question": "From which European country does Limburger cheese originate?", "answers": ["belgium", "belgian"], "context": "Cheeses of Germany and Austria - How To Cooking Tips ...Cheeses of Germany and Austria - How To Cooking Tips - RecipeTips.com \n Cheeses of Germany and Austria \n Cheeses of Germany and Austria \n Allgauer Emmentaler \n Allgauer Emmentaler is a German cow's milk cheese that is much like Swiss Emmental. It is characterized by large holes throughout the cheese and a texture that is somewhat hard. The flavor is rich and slightly sweet. The cheese is often served as a snack or used for sandwiches and for cooking. \n Bruder Basil \n Bruder Basil is a cow's milk cheese from Germany. It has a firm texture and a dark brownish colored natural rind. The cheese is pale yellow and contains very small random holes throughout. The flavor is rich with a slight smokiness. It is produced in small brick shapes that are covered with wax. Bruder Basil is excellent for grilling and for serving on sandwiches, and it is often served simply as a snack or an appetizer. \n Cambozola \n A cheese native to Germany and Austria, Cambozola is basically a combination of Camembert cheese and Gorgonzola cheese, thus the name, which also can be spelled, Cambazola. Soft and spreadable, Cambozola is made from cow's milk with cream added, which forms a cheese that is rich and creamy. The smooth interior contains a few blue veins running throughout, which gives the otherwise mild and somewhat mellow flavor of the cheese a hint of spiciness. The exterior of the cheese is coated with an outer white mold during production. \n Considered to be a type of blue-brie cheese, Cambozola is well suited for salads and appetizers. It is often served with sliced meats and sausages. It can be also added to sauces as a flavorful touch. When served as is, Cambozola should be allowed to reach room temperature to achieve its optimum flavor. \n Farmhouse \n Farmhouse is a term that is commonly applied to any of the different types of European cheeses that are made by traditional cheese making methods and are produced from the raw milk of animals, such as cows, goats, and sheep that are raised on small regional farms, mountain chalet farms, or mountain huts. The quantities of cheese produced from farmhouse methods are small. When approved for production by the European AOC (Appellation d'Origine Controlee) the cheese is categorized as a \"fermier\" or \"farmhouse\" variety. Although this term originated in Europe, it is also often used to classify American varieties of cheese. \n Farmstead \n The term, Farmstead Cheeses, refers to cheeses made with milk collected from a group of farms that are located within close proximity to where the cheese is produced. Typically, the owners of the farms raise their animals on similar grasses, in similar areas, and with similar methods to produce the milk that is used in the production of the cheese. A similar term often associated with European cheeses is farmhouse cheese,referring to cheeses produced in lower volumes and made on individual farms that are situated in valleys, mountainous areas, or the meadowlands of Europe. \n Limburger \n Limburger cheese was first produced by the Trappist monks in Belgium in the early 18th century. Today, Limburger is produced throughout the world, but it is most often found in the U.K., U.S., and Germany-especially Germany, where it is so popular that it is often thought of as a cheese of German origin. \n Limburger is a cow's milk cheese produced in wheels, blocks, or wedges of cheese. Covered with a thin edible rind that is light ivory to reddish brown in color, the paste of the Limburger cheese is white, smoothly textured, and sharp or salty tasting. Limburger cheese is soft-ripened for three to four months using coryneform bacteria. The bacteria combine with the acids in the cheese to produce molecules that contribute significantly in providing Limburger with its most famous characteristic—its pungent aroma. \n Most often, Limburger cheese goes well with hearty meats; robust red wines or dark beers; and earthy brown breads, such as rye or heavy wheat breads. It may also be combined with crackers, fruits, raw onions, salty fish, and nuts when served as an appetizer. \n Munster", "parametric_answer": "germany", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

{"question": "On a standard English QWERTY keyboard the % (percent) sign is above the number?", "answers": ["5"], "context": "6 Non-QWERTY Keyboard Layouts | Mental Floss6 Non-QWERTY Keyboard Layouts | Mental Floss \n 6 Non-QWERTY Keyboard Layouts \n ThinkStock/Erin McCarthy \n Like us on Facebook \n How did the keys on your keyboard wind up in the QWERTY configuration? You can thank Christopher Latham Sholes. He was a typewriter inventor who used a top row layout of letters eerily similar to today’s QWERTY set-up for his Sholes & Gilden Typewriter. That design was sold to the Remington Typewriter company in 1873, which tweaked the design slightly to one we largely see today. \n But not everyone uses QWERTY keyboards! Here are six alternative layouts. \n 1. AZERTY \n Wikimedia Commons \n There are some quirky QWERTY layouts that use largely the same base as Sholes’ original keyboard adapted by Remington, but switch a few keys. AZERTY, used in French-speaking countries across Europe and Africa, is one such version. \n As its name suggests, it switches Q for A and W for Z in the top line. On the right hand side of the second line of letters, the semi colon key is swapped for the M key. In English-speaking western countries using the QWERTY layout, the numbers row on the top of the keyboard are used predominately as numbers (with symbols made by holding down the shift key), but in France the idea is reversed: That’s primarily your accent row, while holding down shift and hitting a key will give you a number. \n 2. QWERTZ \n Wikimedia Commons \n QWERTZ is another slight tweak on the tried-and-tested QWERTY layout. Used predominately in central Europe (Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, and other nearby nations), QWERTZ is not necessarily one single layout: country-by-country variations exist that are tailored to better match the needs of that area’s particular linguistic nuances. \n 3. Dvorak \n Wikimedia Commons \n Though Dvorak may sound like another string of letters, it’s in fact the surname of this keyboard layout’s inventor, August Dvorak. The inventor felt, when he patented his design in 1936, that QWERTY was uneconomical and uncomfortable—and therefore wasn’t the perfect layout. Dvorak believed that his layout was more efficient, and studies seem to agree. \n People using QWERTY keyboards only make 32 percent of strokes on the “home row” (where your fingers naturally rest on a keyboard). For Dvorak, that rises to 70 percent. And likewise, most people are right handed: Dvorak accounts for that, making more than half the strokes right handed. QWERTY calls on people to use their left hands more. But save for a few eager practitioners, Dvorak is the lesser-known layout. \n 4. Colemak \n Wikimedia Commons \n The Colemak keyboard layout is meant to appease those who are uncomfortable with QWERTY but don’t feel like adopting a whole new layout. Instead, it makes 17 changes to key layout, and also does away with the Caps Lock key. It's replaced with a second backspace key, for those of you who make double the amount of mistakes. \n 5. Maltron \n Wikimedia Commons \n The Maltron keyboard may, at first, seem utterly daunting. Rather than a single rectangular grouping of letter-based keys, Maltron produces two square sets of letters, both of which flank a number pad in the middle. The left hand square of letters has the unusual combination of ANISF as its home row, while the right hand square’s home row is set out in the DTHOR combination. \n 6. JCUKEN \n Wikimedia Commons \n For some countries—and some languages—QWERTY just won’t cut it. Russian, for example, uses the Cyrillic alphabet, which is wholly different from the Latin-based English alphabet. Since 1917 (when Russia reformed its alphabet to remove some letters), JCUKEN has been the default layout for Russian keyboards. It’s wholly memorable, for those of you keen to try it out: its home row reads FYWAPROLDV.  QWERTYQWERTY is a keyboard layout for the Latin script. The name comes from reading the first six keys appearing on the top left letter row", "parametric_answer": "QWERTY", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}
{"question": "Glen Moy and Autumn Bliss are varieties of which fruit?", "answers": ["raspberries", "raspberry"], "context": "Autumn Fruiting Raspberries: keeping up with ... - Fruit ForumAutumn Fruiting Raspberries: keeping up with the Joans  - Joan Morgan's Fruit Forum \n Autumn Fruiting Raspberries: keeping up with the Joans \n Joan Squire raspberry \n Derek Jennings, the well known raspberry breeder responsible for all the Glen varieties which were named after the Scottish Glens that Derek had walked, describes his more recent successes produced during his 'retirement' in Kent. \n After years of breeding summer-fruiting raspberries in Scotland it was difficult for me to give up the job when I `retired`. So I formed a partnership with a leading Kent fruit grower and, since I needed a change, took up the breeding of the autumn-fruiting kind. At this time autumn-fruiting, i.e.primocane-fruiting, raspberries; were only just beginning to become popular. Autumn Bliss, launched by East Malling in 1983, was a big advance in earliness and fruit size, but to many growers autumn-fruiting still meant old varieties like Heritage, Zeva or September Red, which either crop late or have poor fruit qualities. A broadening of the gene base was needed and the obvious way to achieve it was to transfer genes from the summer-fruiting kinds. This approach tends to lead to late cropping, and so breeders worldwide were making much use of Autumn Bliss. My Australian collaborator, for example, had success with the cross Autumn Bliss x Glen Moy. Varieties like Glen Moy and several of my best summer-fruiting selections produce a very late autumn crop as well and I began crossing the best of them with the earliest available autumn-croppers. \n Another change was that I could name my varieties after the ladies in the family rather than after Scottish Glens. My first success was Joan Squire. It can be described as a second early and its fruit suited most but not all market outlets. It came from a cross between my Australian collaborator`s selection and the unnamed summer-fruiting selection mentioned. It became a leading variety whose use peaked in 2002 and is now declining in the face of competition from newer varieties. Growers in Chile who export raspberries over long distances to North America reported that it was not quite good enough for this purpose, so I sent them my selection 941/3 from a cross between Joan Squire and Autumn Bliss, just for them to test how it traveled over long distances. The selection has many faults and I asked them not to report them because I know them all! \n To my great surprise they think 941/3 is perfect and last year reported a production of 338 tons of it. I cannot visualise what 338 tons of raspberries look like. Maybe a small mountain? The person who promoted it in Chile is Marcela Zuniga so I named it Marcela in appreciation. It is so early that under the warm growing conditions of Chile and Mexico it gives two primocane crops a year. But we are still too concerned about its short comings to launch it in the UK. \n A selection that came from my own cross between Autumn Bliss and Glen Moy is Terri-Louise. It has exceptional fruit size but poor shelf-life and was more useful as a parent than for commercial use. Crossing it with Joan Squire gave me Joan J. Joan J. clearly illustrates the different priorities of the supermarkets and the consumers. Its very excellent size and flavour make it a clear favourite with consumers as shown by big sales of plants to amateur gardeners and to non-supermarket suppliers. Thus recent annual sales have been 76,000 plants in the UK and 67,000in the USA. But the supermarkets feel that its slight tendency to darken when very ripe and a slightly weak skin strength reduce its shelf-life and they have all refused to accept it. \n In parallel with Joan J. we have Joan Irene (the same Joan using her middle name). This came from a progeny of Joan J. and has been less successful, though it surprised us by attaining popularity in Chile for its early summer crop. No doubt it is a mistake not to assess autumn fruiters for their summer crops as well or, more importantly, for `double` cropping, i.e.an autumn crop at the tips of the", "parametric_answer": "apples", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

{"question": "What gemstone is The Moonstone in the classic novel of that name by Wilkie Collins?", "answers": ["diamond"], "context": "SparkNotes: The Moonstone: ContextSparkNotes: The Moonstone: Context \n The Moonstone \n Table of Contents \n Plot Overview \n Wilkie Collins was born William Wilkie Collins in Marylebone, London on January 8, 1824. Wilkie's father, William Collins, was a famous landscape painter. Collins was educated in England but also traveled in Europe with his family as a child. As a young man, Collins studied to become a lawyer for five years but began writing instead. He published his first book while still in law school—it was a biography of his father, which appeared in 1848 and had good reviews. \n While still a law student, Collins met the extremely popular novelist Charles Dickens. In 1852, Collins published a short story, \"A Terribly Strange Bed\" in Dickens's magazine, Household Words. Dickens and Collins soon became close friends and would collaborate on stories, travel together, and remain close until Dickens's death in 1870. Collins' first major success, The Woman in White, was serialized in another of Dickens's journals, All the Year Round, beginning in 1859. \n Collins's next several novels—No Name (1862), Armadale (1866), and The Moonstone (1868)—were all popular successes, and Collins quickly became famous. At the time of his writing of The Moonstone, however, Collins's health began to decline and would continue to weaken him until his death in 1889, though he would continue to write. For his rheumatic gout, Collins began taking laudanum, a form of opium prescribed by his doctor. Collins quickly became dependent on the drug, and the passages describing Ezra Jennings's opium addiction in The Moonstone are thought to be autobiographical. \n The Moonstone is considered to be one of Collins's best novels, and it is usually read within two traditions: sensational fiction and detective fiction. Collins himself wrote the first novel termed \"sensation\"—The Woman in White. The novels which he wrote in 1860s up to The Moonstone exist within the tradition of the sensation novel, a subgenre of the Victorian novel that was particularly popular in the 1860s. Sensation novels seemingly attempted to excite or frighten with dramatic disclosures and somewhat graphic violence. They took the horror of Gothic fiction and incorporated it within a domestic setting—instead of castles, sensation novels took place in English country estates or London houses. The subject matter of the novels often stemmed from a gripping journalistic story—Collins borrowed details of the case of The Moonstone from the Road Murder Case of 1860 (the crime was the murder of a young boy and the conviction hinged upon a missing, stained dress). He additionally borrowed details of the assault on Septimus Luker and Godfrey Ablewhite in The Moonstone from the media story of an attempted murder on a man in Northumberland Street in London in 1861. \n In addition to partaking of characteristics of the sensation fiction genre, The Moonstone also inaugurated an entirely new genre—detective fiction. In 1928, the poet and critic T. S. Eliot declared The Moonstone \"the first, the longest, and the best of the modern English detective novel.\" Though mystery stories, such as those of Edgar Allen Poe, predate The Moonstone, it was the first novel to hold an undisclosed crime and criminal as its center and to make the detection of both by professionals and amateurs alike, the process of the plot. Many of The Moonstone's elements have since become classic features of the detective novel: the eventual conviction of the least-likely suspect; a bungling investigation led by local police and taken over by a more perceptive, slightly eccentric detective; and the \"fair-play\" format by which no information is concealed from us by the narrator at any given point. \n Finally, The Moonstone was additionally unique in that it took the English colonization of India as its frame-setting and underlying subject matter. The novel begins with the battle of Seringapatam (1799), an historical event which secured the power of the English East India Company in India—the company which, in turn, ensured the England's presence and predominance in India throughout the nineteenth century.

Rick was still under contract with A & M Records due to a deal that The Strawbs had signed a couple of years earlier and was currently touring the world with Yes when the call came from A & M that they wanted a solo album from him. Recorded between Yes tours and in between the making of the Fragile and Close To The Edge albums, fellow Yes members Chris Squire, Steve Howe and Bill Bruford all eventually contributed to the making of the album. After many hours of Rick racking his brains for a subject to get his musical inspiration rolling, he was drawn to a paperback he found at an airport gift shop that chronicled the life of King Henry VIII and his wives. While reading the book, stories of the very sordid, troubled and often tragic existence many of the wives had to endure stirred melodies and musical ideas that would eventually form the basis of the album. He had finally found his concept. Later on, during a listening party at A & M headquarters, record execs proclaimed that progress on the album seemed to be going well and that they wanted to hear it again after the vocals had been added. The look of horror on their faces after Rick proclaimed that the album was indeed finished and was an instrumental keyboard based album must have been priceless. It was deemed unmarketable yet was released to try to at least sell 12,000 copies to cover recording costs. It went on to sell 15 million copies world wide. To launch the album A & M wanted Rick to perform the album in its entirety and he agreed but only if it could be at Hampton Court Palace, one of King Henry VIII's favorite palaces. Their request was denied. Fast forward some 36 years later to 2009 and Rick finally gets his wish. Backed by the English Chamber Choir, Orchestra Europa and the English Rock Ensemble (including Rick's son Adam), the entire album was performed for 2 very special evening performances in May, 2009 at Hampton Court Palace commemorating the 500th anniversary of King Henry VIII's accession to the throne. \n In viewing the behind the scenes segment of this DVD, it's evident that literally hundreds of hours of preparation and rehearsal was required to make this one of a kind event come to fruition. With a massive stage, huge lighting effects and a cast of literally hundreds if you include the entire Orchestra Europa and English Chamber Choir, Rick Wakeman finally brings his life-long dream to life. Beaming as he takes the stage in a king's robe from the Tudor era, he is flanked by the \"Six Wives\" in full period costume. Getting underway with a medley entitled Tudorture 1485, this piece of music links together all the main themes of the tracks Catherine of Aragorn, Kathryn Howard, Jane Seymour, Katherine Parr, Anne Of Cleaves and Anne Boleyn.

National Teams from over 209 “nations” around the world compete in qualification tournaments over three years, with only 32 teams allowed to progress through to compete in the Soccer World Cup finals. FIFA has more members than the UN, as it recognises 23 non-sovereign entities as nations, including places such as Palestine and Scotland. \n FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association), the international governing body of the Soccer World Cup, was founded in 1904. Initial attempts to organise international matches outside of the Olympics were dismal until 2009 when Sir Thomas Lipton (founder of the Lipton tea brand) organised the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy soccer tournament in Turin, Italy. Sometimes described as the first Soccer World Cup, the competition featured professional teams (but not national sides) from Italy, Germany and Switzerland. The English Football Association chose not to participate, so Sir Thomas Lipton invited an amateur side from England, West Auckland. West Auckland went on to win the competition, and did the same again in 1911. \n The World Cup Trophy. Image: Meed. \n In 1914, FIFA became the body responsible for managing soccer competitions at the Olympics, where soccer had become an official sport in 1908. At the 1920 Olympics, the first genuine intercontinental football competition occurred, with Egypt competing alongside thirteen European teams. Belgium won that year, with Uruguay taking out the next two (1924 and 1928). \n On the 28th of May, 1928, FIFA made the decision to host their own Soccer World Cup independently of the Olympics. As Uruguay were reigning Olympic champions, and 1930 represented their centenary of independence, they were named host country for the first Soccer World Cup in 1930. Thirteen nations took part in the initial Soccer World Cup; 7 from South America, 2 from North America and 4 from Europe: \n Argentina \n Romania \n Yugoslavia \n The first goal in Soccer World Cup history was scored by Lucien Laurent of France against Mexico, who they defeated 4-1. Host Uruguay was the first nation to win the Soccer World Cup, defeating Argentina 4-2 in front of a crowd 93,000 strong. \n Soccer was dropped from the 1932 Olympic Games (held in Los Angeles) due to the relatively low popularity of the sport in the host nation. It returned in the 1936 Olympics at Berlin, but by this point the Soccer World Cup organised by FIFA was the leading international competition. \n The Soccer World Cup has been held every four years since it began in 1930, with the exception of 1942 and 1946 as a result of World War II. The current Soccer World Cup champions are Spain, who won the 2010 Soccer World Cup in South Africa. The 1934 and 1938 Soccer World Cup tournaments were held in Italy and France respectively. Brazil was the only South American country to compete at both, seizing third place overall in 1938. \n The Soccer World Cup is one of the world’s most popular sporting events, with over 700 million people tuning in for the final.

Kinda like ‘arugula’. (you just said that out loud didn’t you?) The name derives from a Dutch word, vierdekijn (VEERD-kin), which means ‘fourth’. It’s an Old English unit of measurement, and amounts to about a quarter (fourth) of a full barrel. How much is a quarter barrel? Well obviously that depends a lot on the size of the barrel. \n \"can I interest you in a bit of firkin?\" \n The English have been using the firkin as a measurement for all kinds of things for hundreds of years. British records dating back to the early 1400’s list statutes for how much a firkin actually holds. The product being weighed or measured dictated the barrel size, and thus, the firkin size. In other words, firkins are fickle. A firkin of fish was 21 gallons; a firkin of soap, honey, or butter was around 8 gallons. (sadly, our research turned up no information on the size of a firkin of gherkins.) And, proving that the Brits have always been pretty serious about their suds, they had separate firkin measurements for beer and ale: a beer firkin was 9 gallons, an ale firkin 8 gallons. And those are imperial gallons, slightly larger than U.S. gallons (insert your own buxom British girls joke here). \n Firkin of soap. Not nearly as tasty. \n It really gets fun when you start looking at other forms of measurement from that era. A firkin was the smallest unit of liquid measurement where the barrel was concerned. It took 2 firkins to make a kilderkin, 4 to make a barrel, and 6 to make a hogshead. I can just see being in line at the beer store back then. “Can I get a couple of firkins to fill up my hogshead?” It just sounds dirty. \n OK but where does the tap go? \n Today’s craft beer firkins are 9 imperial gallons, 10.8 U.S. gallons. In brew-speak, about 72 pints of beer. Craft breweries like firkins for several reasons (outside of the fact everyone snickers every time someone says ‘firkin’); they allow for experimentation with existing beers, are naturally carbonated from being sealed in the firkin prior to the completion of fermentation, and are not pasteurized. That not only guarantees freshness when consumed, but allows for some interesting and subtle flavor changes since the brew’s yeast is still active. \n So don’t be a kilderkin. Get your firkin hoghead over to the pub and sample a barrel of cask-conditioned beer. And let us know what you think. \n Share this:  Pints, gallons, firkins, barrels and more!Pints, gallons, firkins, barrels and more! \n The style of glass on the left - with  the fetching bulge part way down - \n is referred to as Nonic.  \n Then there's the      standard straight-sided type. \n Other commonly  available styles are the Tulip . . . \n   \n .  . . and the Dimple \n If you want to strike up an  interesting - and long lasting - discussion in a pub, simply ask a couple of the  locals which shape of beer glass is best.  That should while away a few  happy (or possibly heated!) hours.  \n And if conversation flags you can  always ask them if  beer should be served with a good head of foam . . . \n So if beer comes in casks, don't  they use barrels any more? \n   \n Well, yes and no . . .

{"question": "Which Verdi opera is also a popular acronym used in the advertising and selling professions?", "answers": ["aïda", "aida"], "context": "Giuseppe VerdiGiuseppe Fortunino Francesco Verdi (; 9 or 10 October 1813 – 27 January 1901) was an Italian opera composer. \n Verdi was born near Busseto to a provincial family of moderate means, and developed a musical education with the help of a local patron.  Verdi came to dominate the Italian opera scene after the era of Bellini, Donizetti and Rossini, whose works significantly influenced him, becoming one of the pre-eminent opera composers in history. \n In his early operas Verdi demonstrated a sympathy with the Risorgimento movement which sought the unification of Italy. He also participated briefly as an elected politician. The chorus \"Va, pensiero\" from his early opera Nabucco (1842), and similar choruses in later operas, were much in the spirit of the unification movement, and the composer himself became esteemed as a representative of these ideals. An intensely private person, Verdi however did not seek to ingratiate himself with popular movements and as he became professionally successful was able to reduce his operatic workload and sought to establish himself as a landowner in his native region. He surprised the musical world by returning, after his success with the opera Aida (1871), with three late masterpieces: his Requiem (1874), and the operas Otello (1887) and Falstaff (1893). \n His operas remain extremely popular, especially the three peaks of his 'middle period': Rigoletto, Il trovatore and La traviata, and the bicentenary of his birth in 2013 was widely celebrated in broadcasts and performances. \n Life \n Childhood and education \n Verdi, the first child of Carlo Giuseppe Verdi (1785–1867) and Luigia Uttini (1787–1851), was born at their home in Le Roncole, a village near Busseto, then in the Département Taro and within the borders of  the First French Empire following the annexation of the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza in 1808. The baptismal register, prepared on 11 October 1813, lists his parents Carlo and Luigia as \"innkeeper\" and  \"spinner\" respectively.  Additionally, it lists Verdi as being \"born yesterday\", but since days were often considered to begin at sunset, this could have meant either 9 or 10 October. Verdi himself, following his mother, always celebrated his birthday on 9 October. \n Verdi had a younger sister, Giuseppa, who died aged 17 in 1833. From the age of four, Verdi was given private lessons in Latin and Italian by the village schoolmaster, Baistrocchi, and at six he attended the local school. After learning to play the organ, he showed so much interest in music that his parents finally provided him with a spinet. Verdi's gift for music was already apparent by 1820–21 when he began his association with the local church, serving in the choir, acting as an altar boy for a while, and taking organ lessons. After Baistrocchi's death, Verdi, at the age of eight, became the official paid organist. \n The music historian Roger Parker points out that both of Verdi's parents \"belonged to families of small landowners and traders, certainly not the illiterate peasants from which Verdi later liked to present himself as having emerged... Carlo Verdi was energetic in furthering his son's education...something which Verdi tended to hide in later life... [T]he picture emerges of youthful precocity eagerly nurtured by an ambitious father and of a sustained, sophisticated and elaborate formal education.\" \n In 1823, when he was 10, Verdi's parents arranged for the boy to attend school in Busseto, enrolling him in a Ginnasio—an upper school for boys—run by Don Pietro Seletti, while they continued to run their inn at Le Roncole. Verdi returned to Busseto regularly to play the organ on Sundays, covering the distance of several kilometres on foot. At age 11, Verdi received schooling in Italian, Latin, the humanities, and rhetoric. By the time he was 12, he began lessons with Ferdinando Provesi, maestro di cappella at San Bartolomeo, director of the municipal music school and co-director of the local Società Filarmonica (Philharmonic Society).

Unusually, she mastered both the Spanish style of bullfighting — in which the matador (or, in her case, matadora) is on foot — and the Portuguese, in which the bullfighter is on horseback and is known as a rejoneador or rejoneadora. \n She would sometimes mix both styles in the same fight, squaring up to the bull first on foot, then on horseback, and finally making the kill, once again on foot. \n Known as “La Diosa Rubia” (or “The Blonde Goddess”), she became famous for her skills, reportedly killing more than 750 bulls during her career in Europe, Central America and South America. In Spain, in 1949, Conchita Cintrón was at the centre of one of the most dramatic moments in bullfighting history, when she approached the president’s box and asked permission to break the Spanish law that forbids a woman from dismounting from her horse and fighting the bull on foot. Her request was refused. \n Despite this rebuff, she dismounted, and rushed the unsuspecting young understudy assigned to kill her bull, grabbing his sword and preparing for the kill. Then she dramatically let the sword drop to the sand. When the bull charged, Conchita Cintrón simulated the kill by stroking the beast on the shoulders as it thundered by. \n As the cheering audience erupted she walked calmly away, only to be arrested at the ringside; but with the crowd about to riot in protest, she was pardoned and released. As Orson Welles noted in his introduction to Conchita Cintrón’s autobiography, Memoirs of a Bullfighter (1962), the matadora’s career “ended in a single burst of glorious criminality. You can’t keep a lady waiting forever, and there came an afternoon when she decided that she’d waited long enough.” \n Concepçíon Cintrón Verrill was born on August 9 1922 in Antofagasta in northern Chile to a Puerto Rican father and an American mother. After fighting in Spain, she made her debut in Portugal in 1945. \n She went on to fight in more than 400 events in Portugal, Spain and several countries in South America before retiring at the age of 27. \n During a visit to Los Angeles in 1941, Conchita Cintrón defended her participation in bullfighting, a practice that most Americans found abhorrent. “Would a bull who will be killed in the slaughterhouse by a hammer not rather die gallantly?” she asked a reporter. “Is it not better to give the bull a chance for his life, a sporting chance?” \n Conchita Cintrón was seriously injured in 1949 at Guadalajara, Mexico, when a bull gored her in the thigh. After being carried to the ring’s infirmary, she broke away from the medical team treating her, returned to the ring and killed the bull. She then fell unconscious and was rushed into emergency surgery. \n In retirement she married a Portuguese, Francisco de Castelo Branco. They made their home in Lisbon, where she raised show dogs and eventually took Portuguese citizenship. \n Conchita Cintrón, who died on February 17, is survived by a son. \n    The Daily Undertaker, The Variety and Importance of RitualThe Daily Undertaker: Conchita Cintron, Pioneering Female Bullfighter, dies at age 86 \n Conchita Cintron, Pioneering Female Bullfighter, dies at age 86 \n http://www.ladepeche.fr/ \n Conchita Cintron \n Conchita Cintron, who has died of a heart attack aged 86, broke into the male-dominated sport of bullfighting at the age of 13 and became one of the world's first famous woman matadors. \n Cintron, was a Peruvian who became known as La Diosa Rubia, or The Blonde Goddess.

In contemporary use, the at sign is most commonly used in email addresses. \n It was not included on the keyboard of the earliest commercially successful typewriters, but was on at least one 1889 model[http://www.shadycharacters.co.uk/2011/08/the-symbol-part-2-of-2/ \"The @-symbol, part 2 of 2\"], [http://www.shadycharacters.co.uk/ Shady Characters ⌂ The secret life of punctuation] and the very successful Underwood models from the \"Underwood No. 5\" in 1900 onward. It is now universally included on computer keyboards. The mark is encoded at . \n The fact that there is no single word in English for the symbol has prompted some writers to use the French arobase  or Spanish and Portuguese arroba, or to coin new words such as asperand,[http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2010/mar/28/moma-asperand-ray-tomlinson-design \"New York's Moma claims @ as a design classic\"], Jemima Kiss, 28 March 2010, The Observer ampersat   and strudel), but none of these have achieved wide usage. \n History \n Origin theories \n The earliest yet discovered reference to the @ symbol is a religious one; it features in a Bulgarian translation of a Greek chronicle written by Constantinos Manasses in 1345 (See Figure left). Held today in the Vatican Apostolic Library,  it features the @ symbol in place of the capital letter alpha 'A' in the word Amen. Why it was used in this context is still a mystery. \n In terms of the commercial character of the at sign, there are several theories pending verification. \n * One theory is that the symbol developed as a mercantile shorthand symbol of \"each at\"—the symbol resembling a small \"a\" inside a small \"e\"—to distinguish it from the different \"at\" (symbolized by the mere letter \"a\") or \"per.\" For example, the cost of \"12 apples @ $1\" would be $12, whereas the cost of \"12 apples at $1\" would be $1—a crucial and necessary distinction. \n * Another theory is that medieval monks abbreviated the Latin word  (at, toward, by, about) next to a numeral. One reason for this abbreviation was that it saved space and ink. Since thousands of pages of biblical manuscripts were copied onto expensive papyrus or hides, and the words at, toward, by and about repeated millions of times throughout the pages, a considerable amount of resources could be spared this way. A theory concerning this graphic puts forward the idea that the form derives from the Latin word ad,, using the older form of lower case d : ∂, which persists as the partial derivative symbol. \n * It has been theorized that it was originally an abbreviation of the Greek preposition ανά (transliterated ana), meaning at the rate of or per. \n * Another theory is that it derives from the Norman French \"à\" meaning \"at\" in the \"each\" sense, i.e. \"2 widgets à £5.50 = £11.00\", comes the accountancy shorthand notation in English commercial vouchers and ledgers to the 1990s, when the email usage overtook the accountancy usage. It is also used like this in Modern French, Swedish or Czech; in this view, the at-symbol is a stylised form of à that avoids raising the writing hand from the page in drawing the symbol; this compromise between @ and à in French handwriting is found in street market signs. \n History \n Whatever the origin of the @ symbol, the history of its usage is more well-known: it has long been used in Spanish and Portuguese as an abbreviation of arroba, a unit of weight equivalent to 25 pounds, and derived from the Arabic expression of \"a quarter\" (الربع pronounced ar-rubʿ).  An Italian academic claims to have traced the @ symbol to the 16th century, in a mercantile document sent by Florentine Francesco Lapi from Seville to Rome on May 4", "parametric_answer": "comma", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

I have always had an interest in wildlife and this prompted me to do a degree in Ecology. As well as birds, I am particularly interested in invertebrates, reptiles and amphibians. \n Sent in by Phil Greenwood, Birstall, West Yorkshire \n Technically, the most common bird in the world is the domestic chicken, with around 50 billion birds. However, the most common wild bird is thought to be the red-billed quelea. They are sparrow-sized birds with brown bodies and the males have a red bill with variable face markings. \n This species is found in sub-Saharan Africa. They are members of the weaver family and there are thought to be about 1.5 billion breeding birds. They are very social and some flocks can be in the millions. They feed on seed and, because of their numbers, can damage crops. \n The most common bird in the UK is the wren. There are thought to be around 8.5 million breeding territories in the UK. This may surprise some people because they are not as regularly seen as woodpigeons or house sparrows, for example. \n However, wrens are very widespread throughout the UK and inhabit a wide range of habitats. They like to stay close to cover so don't often come onto feeders but can easily be heard as they have a very loud song for a small bird. \n How you can help  What is the most common bird in the world? | Reference.comWhat is the most common bird in the world? | Reference.com \n What is the most common bird in the world? \n A: \n Quick Answer \n The most common domesticated bird in the world is the domesticated chicken, and the most common wild bird is the house sparrow. As of 2011, there were 50 billion chickens and 1.5 billion house sparrows in the world. \n Full Answer \n Birds are the only direct descendants of dinosaurs living today. House sparrows are thought to have existed more than 100,000 years ago, and scientists believe that this type of bird interacted frequently with humans 10,000 to 20,000 years ago. They can now be found in every part of the world, including the Americas, Africa and Europe. \n Adult house sparrows eat a combination of grains and insects, while the babies eat mostly insects to help them grow. Although many farmers consider them pests because they make a meal out of crops, without the house sparrow, the insects on the crops would destroy more plants than the sparrows ever could.

[1] Although Pluto was discovered in 1930, limited information on the distant object delayed a realistic understanding of its characteristics. Pluto is the second largest known dwarf planet and tenth largest orbiting the Sun . From its time of discovery in 1930 to 2006 it was considered to be the ninth planet in the solar system, but because additional objects have been discovered including Eris which is 27% more massive, the IAU reclassified Pluto and the other objects as dwarf planets. [2]  SunThe Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma,   with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.  It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. \n About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen; the rest is mostly helium, with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. \n The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on spectral class and is informally referred to as a yellow dwarf. It formed approximately 4.6 billionAll numbers in this article are short scale. One billion is 109, or 1,000,000,000.  years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense,  that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process. \n The Sun is roughly middle-aged and has not changed dramatically for over four billion years, and will remain fairly stable for more than another five billion years. However, after hydrogen fusion in its core has stopped, the Sun will undergo severe changes and become a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury, Venus, and possibly Earth. \n The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times, and the Sun has been regarded by some cultures as a deity. The synodic rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the basis of the solar calendar, which is the predominant calendar in use today. \n Name and etymology \n The English proper noun Sun developed from Old English sunne and may be related to south. Cognates to English sun appear in other Germanic languages, including Old Frisian sunne, sonne, Old Saxon sunna, Middle Dutch sonne, modern Dutch zon, Old High German sunna, modern German Sonne, Old Norse sunna, and Gothic sunnō. All Germanic terms for the Sun stem from Proto-Germanic *sunnōn. \n The English weekday name Sunday stems from Old English (Sunnandæg; \"Sun's day\", from before 700) and is ultimately a result of a Germanic interpretation of Latin dies solis, itself a translation of the Greek ἡμέρα ἡλίου (hēméra hēlíou).  The Latin name for the Sun, Sol, is not common in general English language use; the adjectival form is the related word solar.   The term sol is also used by planetary astronomers to refer to the duration of a solar day on another planet, such as Mars.  A mean Earth solar day is approximately 24 hours, whereas a mean Martian 'sol' is 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds.  \n Religious aspects \n Solar deities and Sun worship can be found throughout most of recorded history in various forms, including the Egyptian Ra, the Hindu Surya, the Japanese Amaterasu, the Germanic Sól, and the Aztec Tonatiuh, among", "parametric_answer": "neptune", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}
{"question": "What often poisonous compound, CN, found in fruit seeds and stones, named from Greek for dark blue, comprises Carbon and Nitrogen?", "answers": ["cyanide", "cyanides", "cn"], "context": "CyanideA cyanide is any chemical compound that contains monovalent combining group CN. This group, known as the cyano group, consists of a carbon atom triple-bonded to a nitrogen atom.  \n In inorganic cyanides, such as sodium cyanide and potassium cyanide this group is present as the negatively charged polyatomic cyanide ion (CN−); these compounds, which are regarded as salts of hydrocyanic acid, are highly toxic.  The cyanide ion is isoelectronic with carbon monoxide and with molecular nitrogen.   \n Organic cyanides are usually called nitriles; in these, the CN group is linked by a covalent bond to a carbon-containing group, such as methyl (CH3) in methyl cyanide (acetonitrile). Because they do not release cyanide ions, nitriles are generally less toxic, or in the case of insoluble polymers such as acrylic fiber, essentially nontoxic unless burned.  \n   \n Hydrocyanic acid, also known as hydrogen cyanide, or HCN, is a highly volatile liquid used to prepare acrylonitrile, which is used in the production of acrylic fibers, synthetic rubber, and plastics. Cyanides are employed in a number of chemical processes, including fumigation, case hardening of iron and steel, electroplating, and the concentration of ores. In nature, substances yielding cyanide are present in certain seeds, such as the pit of the cherry and the seeds of apples. \n Nomenclature and etymology \n In IUPAC nomenclature, organic compounds that have a –C≡N functional group are called nitriles. Thus, nitriles are organic compounds.   \n An example of a nitrile is CH3CN, acetonitrile, also known as methyl cyanide. Nitriles usually do not release cyanide ions. A functional group with a hydroxyl and cyanide bonded to the same carbon is called cyanohydrin. Unlike nitriles, cyanohydridins do release hydrogen cyanide. In inorganic chemistry, salts containing the C≡N− ion are referred to as cyanides. \n The word is derived from the Greek kyanos, meaning dark blue, as a result of its being first obtained by the heating of the pigment known as Prussian blue. \n Occurrence and reactions \n In nature \n Cyanides are produced by certain bacteria, fungi, and algae and are found in a number of plants. Cyanides are found in substantial amounts in certain seeds and fruit stones, e.g., those of apricots, apples, and peaches.  In plants, cyanides are usually bound to sugar molecules in the form of cyanogenic glycosides and defend the plant against herbivores. Cassava roots (also called manioc), an important potato-like food grown in tropical countries (and the base from which tapioca is made), also contain cyanogenic glycosides.  \n The Madagascar bamboo Cathariostachys madagascariensis produces cyanide as a deterrent to grazing. In response, the golden bamboo lemur, which eats the bamboo, has developed a high tolerance to cyanide. \n Interstellar medium \n The cyanide radical CN· has been identified in interstellar space.  The cyanide radical (called cyanogen) is used to measure the temperature of interstellar gas clouds.  \n Pyrolysis and combustion product \n Hydrogen cyanide is produced by the combustion or pyrolysis of certain materials under oxygen-deficient conditions. For example, it can be detected in the exhaust of internal combustion engines and tobacco smoke. Certain plastics, especially those derived from acrylonitrile, release hydrogen cyanide when heated or burnt. \n Coordination chemistry \n The cyanide anion is a ligand for many transition metals.  The high affinities of metals for this anion can be attributed to its negative charge, compactness, and ability to engage in π-bonding. Well-known complexes include: \n *hexacyanides [M(CN)6]3− (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co), which are octahedral in shape.   \n *the tetracyanides, [M(CN)4]2− (M = Ni, Pd, Pt), which are square planar in their geometry; \n *the dicyanides [M(CN)2]− (M = Cu, Ag, Au), which are linear in geometry. \n Among the most important cyanide coordination compounds are the octahedrally coordinated compounds potassium ferrocyanide and the pigment Prussian blue, which are both essentially nontoxic due to the tight binding of the cyanides to a central iron atom.  \n Prussian blue", "parametric_answer": "prussic acid", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}
{"question": "What is another name for ultra-violet light?", "answers": ["black lights", "blacklight", "black light", "black light lamp"], "context": "UltravioletUltraviolet (UV) is an electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength from 10 nm (30 PHz) to 380 nm (750 THz), shorter than that of visible light but longer than X-rays. UV radiation is present in sunlight. It is also produced by electric arcs and specialized lights such as mercury-vapor lamps, tanning lamps, and black lights. Although lacking the energy to ionize atoms, long-wavelength ultraviolet radiation can cause chemical reactions and causes many substances to glow or fluoresce. Consequently, biological effects of UV are greater than simple heating effects, and many practical applications of UV radiation derive from its interactions with organic molecules. \n Suntan, freckling and sunburn are familiar effects of over-exposure, along with higher risk of skin cancer. Living things on dry land would be severely damaged by ultraviolet radiation from the Sun if most of it were not filtered out by the Earth's atmosphere.  More-energetic, shorter-wavelength \"extreme\" UV below 121 nm ionizes air so strongly that it is absorbed before it reaches the ground.   \n Ultraviolet is also responsible for the formation of bone-strengthening vitamin D in most land vertebrates, including humans. The UV spectrum thus has effects both beneficial and harmful to human health. \n Near-UV light is visible to some insects, mammals, and birds. Small birds have a fourth color receptor for ultraviolet light; this gives birds \"true\" UV vision.  Reindeer use near-UV light to see polar bears, who are poorly visible in regular light because they blend in with the snow. UV light also allows mammals to see urine trails, which is helpful for prey animals to find food in the wild. The males and females of some butterfly species look identical to the human eye but very different to UV-sensitive eyes—the males sport bright patterns in order to attract the females  Most ultraviolet rays are invisible to most humans: the lens on a human eye ordinarily filters out UVB frequencies or lower, and humans lack color receptor adaptations for ultraviolet light, so humans don’t see many of the \"light or colours\" certain animals see.  \n Under some conditions, children and young adults can see ultraviolet down to wavelengths of about 310 nm,   and people with aphakia (missing lens) or replacement lens  can also see some UV wavelengths. People who don't have lenses often report seeing ultraviolet light that looks \"whitish blue\" or \"whitish violet\". This happens because our three color receptors (red, green and blue) are all sensitive to ultraviolet light, so the light comes in as a mixture of the three receptors, with a slight nod to blue side of the spectrum. \n Discovery  \n \"Ultraviolet\" means \"beyond violet\" (from Latin ultra, \"beyond\"), violet being the color of the highest frequencies of visible light. Ultraviolet light has a higher frequency than violet light. \n UV radiation was discovered in 1801 when the German physicist Johann Wilhelm Ritter observed that invisible rays just beyond the violet end of the visible spectrum darkened silver chloride-soaked paper more quickly than violet light itself. He called them \"oxidizing rays\" to emphasize chemical reactivity and to distinguish them from \"heat rays\", discovered the previous year at the other end of the visible spectrum. The simpler term \"chemical rays\" was adopted shortly thereafter, and it remained popular throughout the 19th century, although there were those who held that these were an entirely different sort of radiation from light (notably John William Draper, who named them \"tithonic rays\"  ). The terms chemical and heat rays were eventually dropped in favour of ultraviolet and infrared radiation, respectively.   \n In 1878 the effect of short-wavelength light on sterilizing bacteria was discovered. By 1903 it was known the most effective wavelengths were around 250 nm. In 1960, the effect of ultraviolet radiation on DNA was established.  \n The discovery of the ultraviolet radiation below 200 nm, named vacuum ultraviolet because it is strongly absorbed by air, was made in 1893 by the German physicist Victor Schumann.", "parametric_answer": "uv", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}
{"question": "The pericardium is part of which organ?", "answers": ["heart"], "context": "Pericardium - man AnatomyPericardium \n Pericardium \n Human Anatomy » Body Systems » Cardiovascular System » Pericardium \n Pericardium is a fibroserous sac, which encloses the heart and roots of great vessels. It has two primary functions. Firstly, it restricts excessive movements of the heart so that injury to this vital organ of human body is avoided. Secondly, it serves as a lubricated container in which different parts of the heart can contract. \n The pericardium lies within the middle mediastinum, posterior to body of sternum and anterior to fifth to eighth thoracic vertebrae. \n The pericardium consists of two parts: fibrous pericardium and serous pericardium. \n Fibrous pericardium: \n It is the strong fibrous part of pericardium, which is attached firmly to the central tendon of diaphragm below. It fuses with the outer coats of great blood vessels that pass through it. These blood vessels are: Aorta, Superior vena cave, Inferior vena cave, Pulmonary trunk, Pulmonary veins. Fibrous pericardium is attached in front to the sternum be means of sternopericardial ligaments. \n Serous pericardium: \n This part of pericardium coats the heart and lines the fibrous pericardium on the inside. It is composed of two layers: Parietal and Visceral. \n Parietal layer of serous pericardium: \n It lines the fibrous pericardium and is reflected around the roots of great blood vessels. At the region of reflection, it becomes continuous with the visceral layer of serous pericardium, which covers the heart closely. \n Visceral layer of serous pericardium: \n This layer is closely applied to the heart and is often called the epicardium. There exists a slit like space between the parietal and visceral layers of serous pericardium. This space is known as pericardial cavity and it contains a small amount of tissue fluid called pericardial fluid. Pericardial fluid acts as a lubricant to facilitate the movements of heart. \n Pericardial sinuses: \n On the posterior surface of the heart, the reflection of the serous pericardium around the large veins form a recess called oblique sinus. There is another sinus on the posterior surface of the heart, which is called transverse sinus. Transverse sinus is in the form of a short passage that lies between the reflection of serous pericardium around the aorta and reflection around large veins. The pericardial sinuses form as a consequence of the way the heart bends during development. They don’t have any clinical significance. \n Nerve supply of the pericardium: \n Fibrous pericardium and the parietal layer of serous pericardium are supplied by phrenic nerves. The visceral layer of serous pericardium has different innervations than the parietal layer. It is innervated by branches of sympathetic trunks and vagus nerves. \n Share this page:  Pericardium | Article about pericardium by The Free DictionaryPericardium | Article about pericardium by The Free Dictionary \n Pericardium | Article about pericardium by The Free Dictionary \n http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/pericardium \n see heart heart, \n muscular organ that pumps blood to all parts of the body.

The pericardium proper consists, in turn, of an internal, serous layer and an external, fibrous layer. The epicardium, being an external membrane of the heart, directly covers and is fused to the heart muscle (myocardium). In the region where large blood vessels enter and leave the heart, the epicardium is turned back and is continuous with the pericardium proper. Between the pericardium layers is a slitlike cavity containing a small quantity of transparent pale-yellow serous fluid. The pericardium contains blood vessels, lymphatics, and numerous nerve endings and is surrounded by areolar connective tissue.

Let It Snow! Let It Snow!  Die HardDie Hard is a 1988 American action film directed by John McTiernan and written by Steven E. de Souza and Jeb Stuart. It follows off-duty New York City Police Department officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) as he takes on a group of highly organized criminals led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), who perform a heist in a Los Angeles skyscraper under the guise of a terrorist attack using hostages, including McClane's wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), to keep the police at bay. \n It is based on Roderick Thorp's 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever, the sequel to 1966's The Detective, which was adapted into a 1968 film of the same name that starred Frank Sinatra. Fox was therefore contractually obligated to offer Sinatra the lead role in Die Hard, but he turned it down. The studio then pitched the film to Arnold Schwarzenegger as a sequel to his 1985 action film Commando; he turned it down, as well, and the studio finally and reluctantly gave it to Willis, then known primarily as a comedic television actor. \n Made for $28 million, Die Hard grossed over $140 million theatrically worldwide, and was given a positive reception from critics. The film turned Willis into an action star, became a metonym for an action film in which a lone hero fights overwhelming odds, and has been named one of the best action movies ever made.   The film also ranks #29 on Empire magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.  The film's success spawned the Die Hard franchise, which includes four sequels (Die Hard 2, Die Hard with a Vengeance, Live Free or Die Hard and A Good Day to Die Hard), video games, and a comic book. \n Plot \n On Christmas Eve, New York City Police Detective John McClane arrives in Los Angeles. He aims to reconcile with his estranged wife, Holly, at the Christmas party of her employer, the fictional Nakatomi corporation. McClane is driven to the party by Argyle, an airport limousine driver. While McClane changes clothes, the party is disrupted by the arrival of Hans Gruber and his heavily armed terrorists: Karl, Franco, Tony, Theo, Alexander, Marco, Kristoff, Eddie, Uli, Heinrich, Fritz, and James. The group seizes the tower and secures those inside as hostages, except for McClane, who manages to slip away. \n Gruber singles out Nakatomi executive Joseph Takagi, and says he intends to teach the corporation a lesson for its greed. Away from the hostages, Gruber interrogates Takagi for the code to the building's vault. Gruber admits that they are using terrorism as a distraction while they attempt to steal $640 million in bearer bonds in the vault. Takagi refuses to cooperate and is murdered by Gruber. McClane, who has been secretly watching, accidentally gives himself away and is pursued by Tony. McClane manages to kill Tony, taking his weapon and radio, which he uses to contact the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). Sgt. Al Powell is sent to investigate. Gruber sends Heinrich and Marco to stop McClane, who kills them both. Powell, having been greeted by Eddie, who poses as a concierge, finds nothing strange about the building. As Powell turns to leave, McClane drops Marco's corpse onto his patrol car. After being fired upon by the terrorists, Powell summons the LAPD who surround the building.

Lizards are part of a group of animals known as reptiles. They are most closely related to snakes. In fact, some lizards, called sheltopusiks, look like snakes because they have no legs! Many lizards today resemble the ancient reptiles of the dinosaur era. Their ancestors appeared on Earth over 200 million years ago.  \n In general, lizards have a small head, short neck, and long body and tail. Unlike snakes, most lizards have moveable eyelids. There are currently over 4,675 lizard species, including iguanas, chameleons, geckos, Gila monsters, monitors, and skinks. \n Most lizards have eyelids, just like we do, that clean and protect their eyes when they blink. But some lizards, like geckos, can’t blink! Instead, they have a clear membrane that shields their eyes from dirt or bright sun and use their tongue to clean their eyes. Many lizards, such as iguanas, can see in color. Their colorful body parts allow them to communicate with each other and help them tell which are male and which are female. \n Lizards smell stuff with their tongues! Just like snakes, a lizard sticks out its tongue to catch scent particles in the air and then pulls back its tongue and places those particles on the roof of its mouth, where there are special sensory cells. The lizard can use these scent “clues” to find food or a mate or to detect enemies. \n Lizards don’t have earflaps like mammals do. Instead, they have visible ear openings to catch sound, and their eardrums are just below the surface of their skin. Even so, lizards can’t hear as well as we do, but their hearing is better than that of snakes. \n Lizards have dry, scaly skin that does not grow with their bodies. Instead, most lizards shed, or molt, their old skin in large flakes to make way for the new skin growth underneath. The exception to this is with the alligator lizard, which may shed its skin in one piece, like a snake. The scales on lizards vary, depending on their habitat. Skinks have smooth scales so mud won’t cling to them; some lizard species have bony plates, called osteoderms, under their scales for added protection against rough terrain. \n Lizards are popular prey for many types of predators, from birds of prey to snakes and carnivorous mammals. Their camouflage and ability to stay still for hours helps keep them safe. Several types of lizards are able to escape from an enemy’s grasp by breaking off part of their own tail. The tail has a weak spot just for this purpose. If a predator grabs the lizard by its tail, the tail easily comes off. It can grow back over time, although the tail won’t look quite the same. Still, it’s better than being someone else’s dinner! \n Other lizards have different ways to stay safe. Horned lizards are able to squirt blood from tiny blood vessels in their eyes to scare away or confuse a predator.

Indeed the practise of using dogs with a keen sense of smell to track prey has been traced back to ancient Egypt and many Greek and Roman influenced countries. However it is believed that the custom for a fox to be tracked, chased and often killed by trained hunting hounds (generally those with the keenest sense of smell known as ‘scent hounds’) and followed by the Master of the Foxhounds and his team on foot and horseback, originated from a Norfolk farmer’s attempt to catch a fox using farm dogs in 1534. \n Whilst foxes were widely regarded as vermin and farmers and other landowners had hunted the animals for many years as a form of pest control (both to curb their attacks on farm animals and for their highly prized fur) it wasn’t until the eighteenth century that fox hunting developed into it’s most modern incarnation and was considered a sport in its own right as a result of the decline in the UK’s deer population. \n The decline in the deer population and subsequently the sport of deer hunting, or stalking as it is also known, occurred as a consequence of the Inclosure Acts passed between 1750 –1860, particularly the Inclosure (Consolidation) Act of 1801, which was passed to clarify previous acts of inclosure. These acts meant that open fields and common land where many deer chose to breed were fenced off into separate, smaller fields to cope with the increase in the demand for farm land. The birth of the Industrial Revolution saw the introduction of new roads, railways and canals which further reduced the amount of rural land in the United Kingdom , although conversely this improvement in transport links also made foxhunting more popular and easily accessible for those living in towns and cities who aspired to the life of the country gentleman. \n For those hunters who had previously tracked deer, which required large areas of open land, foxes and hares became the prey of choice in the seventeenth century, with packs of hounds being trained specifically to hunt. England’s oldest fox hunt, which is still running today, is the Bilsdale Hunt in Yorkshire , established by George Villiers, the Duke of Buckingham in 1668. \n The sport continued to grow in popularity throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and in 1753 the 18-year-old Hugo Meynell, often called the father of modern foxhunting, began to breed hunting dogs for their speed and stamina as well as their keen scent at Quorndon Hall, his estate in North Leicestershire . The speed of his pack not only allowed for a more exciting and extended hunt, but it also meant that the hunt could begin later in the morning, which made it immensely popular with the young gentleman in his social circle amongst whom late nights were de rigueur. \n Foxhunting continued to grow in popularity throughout the nineteenth century, particularly because of the inroads made by the Great British Railway which provided rural access to the masses. Despite the banning of the sport in Germany and other European countries from 1934 onwards, foxhunting in the United Kingdom remained popular well into the twentieth century. Indeed a shortage of foxes in England led to a demand for foxes to be imported from France, Germany, Holland and Sweden. \n These days however, foxhunting in the UK is much better known for the controversial views of those who champion the sport and those that oppose it. The debate between hunters and anti-hunting campaigners, who believe the sport to be cruel and unnecessary, eventually led to a Government inquiry in December 1999 into hunting with dogs, named the Burns Inquiry after the retired civil servant Lord Burns who chaired the inquiry. \n Whilst the Burns Inquiry report noted that hunting with dogs \"seriously compromises\" the welfare of the foxes, it did not categorically state whether or not hunting should be permanently banned in the UK. As a result of the report, the Government introduced an ‘options bill', so that each House of Parliament could decide on whether the sport should be banned or subject to licensed hunting or self-regulation.", "parametric_answer": "bullfighting", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

Oscar stands 13½ inches tall and weighs 8½ lbs. \n 6. The film reel features five spokes, signifying the five original branches of the Academy: actors, directors, producers, technicians and writers. Although the statuette remains true to its original design, the size of the base varied until 1945, when the current standard was adopted. \n 7. Officially named the Academy Award of Merit, the statuette is better known by its nickname, Oscar. While the origins of the moniker are not clear, a popular story has it that upon seeing the trophy for the first time, Academy librarian (and eventual executive director) Margaret Herrick remarked that it resembled her Uncle Oscar. The Academy didn’t adopt the nickname officially until 1939. \n The Oscar statuette measures just 13½ inches high \n 8. The statuettes presented at the initial ceremonies were gold-plated solid bronze. Within a few years the bronze was abandoned in favour of Britannia metal, a pewter-like alloy which is then plated in copper, nickel silver, and finally, 24-carat gold. \n 9. Due to a metal shortage during the Second World War, Oscars were made of painted plaster for three years. Following the war, the Academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for gold-plated metal ones. \n 10. The Academy is not certain how many statuettes it will hand out until the envelopes are opened on the night of the ceremony. Although the number of categories are known in advance, the possibility of ties and of multiple recipients sharing the prize in some categories makes it impossible to predict the exact number of statuettes to be awarded.

Set in the near future against the background of a British space programme, it tells the story of the first manned flight into space, overseen by Professor Bernard Quatermass of the British Experimental Rocket Group. When the spaceship that carried the first successful crew returns to Earth, two of the three astronauts are missing, and the third is behaving strangely. It becomes clear that an alien presence entered the ship during its flight, and Quatermass and his associates must prevent the alien from destroying the world. \n Originally comprising six half-hour episodes, it was the first science-fiction production to be written especially for an adult television audience. Previous written-for-television efforts such as Stranger from Space (1951–52) were aimed at children, whereas adult entries into the genre were adapted from literary sources, such as R.U.R. (1938 and again in 1948) and The Time Machine (1949). The serial was the first of four Quatermass productions to be screened on British television between 1953 and 1979. \n As well as spawning various remakes and sequels, The Quatermass Experiment inspired much of the television science fiction that followed it, particularly in the United Kingdom, where it influenced successful series such as Doctor Who and Sapphire and Steel. It also influenced Hollywood blockbusters such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Alien. \n Production \n The serial was written by BBC television drama writer Nigel Kneale, who had been an actor and an award-winning fiction writer before joining the BBC. The BBC's Head of Television Drama, Michael Barry, had committed most of his £250 original script budget for the year to employing Kneale. An interest in science, particularly the idea of 'science going bad', led Kneale to write The Quatermass Experiment. The project originated when a gap formed in the BBC's schedules for a six-week serial to run on Saturday nights over the summer of 1953, and Kneale's idea was to fill it with \"a mystifying, rather than horrific\" storyline. \n Rudolph Cartier, one of the BBC's most highly regarded directors, directed the serial. He and Kneale had collaborated on the play Arrow to the Heart, and worked closely on the initial storyline to make it suit the television production methods of the time. Kneale claimed to have picked his leading character's unusual last name at random from a London telephone directory. He chose the character's first name, Bernard, in honour of astronomer Bernard Lovell. The working titles for the production were The Unbegotten and Bring Something Back...!, the latter a line of dialogue in the second episode. Kneale had not finished scripting the final two episodes of the serial before the first episode was transmitted. The production had an overall budget of £4000. The theme music used was \"Mars, Bringer of War\" from Gustav Holst's The Planets . \n Each episode was rehearsed from Monday to Friday at the Student Movement House on Gower Street in London, with camera rehearsals taking place all day on Saturday before transmission. The episodes were then transmitted live—with a few pre-filmed 35mm film inserts shot before and during the rehearsal period—from Studio A of the BBC's original television studios at Alexandra Palace in London. It was one of the last major dramas to be broadcast from the Palace, as the majority of television production was soon to transfer to Lime Grove Studios, and it was made using the BBC's oldest television cameras, the Emitrons, installed with the opening of the Alexandra Palace studios in 1936. These cameras gave a poor-quality picture, with areas of black and white shading across portions of the image. \n The Quatermass Experiment was transmitted weekly on Saturday night from July 18 to August 22, 1953 .", "parametric_answer": "quatermass", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

The largest group of the islands original population is the Nivkh tribe of the northern taigas. \n Sakhalin has long been the scene of a power struggle between the major Asian powers: Russia, Japan and even the Chinese Qing Empire have put forward claims on the island. In the 17th century both Japan and Russia started colonizing the island, from different ends, dividing the island into a northern Russian part and a southern Japanese part.  Aside from a 25 year period at the end of the 19th century, the island remained divided until the waning days of WWII, when Soviet troops broke through the defensive line and invaded the Japanese half. After the end of the war, the Japanese and Ainu people were forcefully repatriated to Japan, while a sizable Korean minority – brought by the Japanese into forced labour camps – remained on the island and were denied repatriation until the last years of Soviet rule, though many still remain on Sakhalin. \n Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Sakhalin has experienced an oil boom with Russian and foreign oil companies pouring into the island, bringing with it much needed investment in the islands infrastructure. This comes with a price though, as pipelines and logging pose a significant threat to the island's spectacular nature. There have also been complaints that the many oil dollars pouring in aren't benefiting the island's population. \n Climate[ edit ] \n Thanks to the cold and raw Sea of Okhotsk which surrounds the island, the climate on Sakhalin is generally cool and humid. In the depth of winter the average temperature ranges from a bearable –6°C in the south to a bone chilling –24°C in the north, while temperatures as cold as –54°C have been reported. In the summer temperature rarely exceeds +19°C, often much cooler and floating ice can be observed around the island, even in the height of summer. Generally the north is much colder than the south, in part due to a warm current running along the Tartar strait in the southern end, the winter is a full 2 months longer in the North (October-May). The annual precipitation ranges between 600-1200 mm, and snowfall can be heavy – in the mountains accumulation of 5 meter snow or more is not unusual. \n Geography[ edit ] \n A critically endangered Western Pacific gray whale breaching off the coast \n At more than 70,000 km2, Sakhalin is Russia's largest island. From the 40 km La Pérouse Strait separating Sakhalin from the Japanese island of Hokkaido , the island stretches nearly 1000 km northwards in a long and narrow shape along the mainland's east coast. It's quite mountainous with two low mountain-ranges running parallel to each other separated by a valley tract.  To the north the island flattens into a swampy taiga, while the central part of the island is densely forested. \n These central forests are home to more than 2000 Sakhalin brown bears, which are often spotted even on the outskirts of the cities.  Otters and sables are also common sightings. Up north there are numerous reindeer, many of them are herded by the indigenous Nivkhi tribe. Whales are also a common sighting along the east coast of the island, and Sakhalin is the only known feeding ground of the west pacific colony of the Gray Whales.  Other whales spotted around the island include the Right Whale, the Bowhead Whale and the Beluga Whale, and up on the shores it's possible to spot Northern fur seals and sea lions. \n Culture[ edit ] \n Indigenous Reindeer herders racing down a Sakhalin road \n The Nivkh are the only remaining significant indigenous ethnic group, of a population that previously also included the Ainu and Orok people: around 5000 live on Sakhalin, mainly in the northern taigas, with the village of Nekrasovska", "parametric_answer": "kamchatka", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

As Staten Island's population is the smallest, it may seem to the outside observer that it's small in area.

Henry Hudson sailed past the island in the Half Moon in 1609, his mate remarking that \"the land is very pleasant and high, and bold to fall withal.\" Once the West India Company began to settle the Hudson River, this island at the mouth of the magnificent harbor, rich with trees and pasture land and nearly sixty square miles in size, caught their attention. In 1630, Pieter Minuit, as director general of New Netherland, purchased the island from the Unami Indians of the Delaware tribe for \"Duffels, Kittles, Axes, Hoes, Wampum, Drilling Awls, Jews Harps, and diverse other small wares.\" \n But the Dutch plantations on Staten Island didn't fare well. In 1641, after the new director general, Willem Kieft, decided to levy a tax on local Indians, the Raritan tribe attacked the Staten Island plantation of the Dutch adventurer David de Vries, killing four people. It was the end of the colony's relatively peaceful days among its Indian neighbors. \n The first permanent settlement on the island was Oude Dorp (\"Old Town\"), populated by French Huguenots. With only five percent of New York City's population and no road access to Manhattan, Staten Island has always been the forgotten borough of the city. Staten Islanders have tended to feel dumped-on, and with good reason: the island's Fresh Kills landfill is one of the largest in the world (it is visible by the naked eye from outer space).

Characterized by upright green leaves with yellow, horizontal bands, this warm-season bird-attracting grass can add ornamental value to a garden or landscape. Porcupine grass is low-maintenance and can grow up to 9 feet tall and 5 feet wide. Propagation is accomplished by dividing root clumps in spring, after the grass is three years old. \n Location \n Native to Asia, porcupine grass thrives in climates within U.S. Department of Agriculture Plant Hardiness Zones 5 through 9. This ornamental grass prefers a sunny or partially sunny location of the garden, providing at least six hours of full sun exposure. An area that exposes the grass to the morning sun and offers protection from hot afternoon sun is ideal. Porcupine grass works as a container plant, privacy screen, landscape specimen or shrub substitute. \n Soil \n Porcupine grass is moderately drought-tolerant and grows well in soil warmed to 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Cooler soil can impair growth or cause rotting. Once established, porcupine grass adapts to a wide variety of soils including compacted clay, loamy and sandy soils. The ideal soil pH for growing porcupine grass ranges from 6.8 to 7.7; this is achieved, if necessary, by amending the soil based on the results of a soil pH test. \n Water and Fertilizer \n Newly planted porcupine grass prefers consistently moist soil, requiring a watering frequency of about two to three times per week. The needed amount of watering is decreased after rainfall and increased during hot weather. After about one year, the grass is established and watering sparingly is sufficient. A spring application of a balanced fertilizer can help promote growth and help prevent yellow, weak foliage. \n Pruning \n Pruning porcupine grass helps to keep old growth and brown foliage from mixing with new, green growth. Cutting back is best done in spring, because during winter, the grass still has ornamental value and its foliage helps to protect the plant from harsh weather conditions. The grass is cut with pruning shears to reduce the length of the foliage to at least 4 inches above ground.", "parametric_answer": "stipa tenacissima", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

{"question": "In which country was the first 24 hour race for motor cars held on a closed course, in 1907?", "answers": ["england"], "context": "University of Massachusetts Lowell Center for Lowell HistoryUniversity of Massachusetts Lowell Center for Lowell History \n by  \n Raymond Hoag  \n      \"CARS ARE COMING,\" that was the call heard along the race course in 1908 when Lowell hosted its first automobile carnival and road race. During this period, New England was attracting an increasing number of automobiles each year. Drawn by the number of model state highways that were being extended every season and by the wonderful  \n variety of scenery that had nicknamed this part of the country the Switzerland of America, New England was a primary destination for motoring tourists. 1908 and 1909 events drew lovers of the sport to  \n Lowell not only from the region but from all over the country and Canada.  \n      The rapid development of the automobile industry in the United States was due in no small measure to the racing contests that were held during this era. These races brought the motorized machine to widespread recognition. The sight of horseless carriages attaining a speed of 50 miles an hour on the  \n   \n   \n old Guttenberg race track in New Jersey at the Three Counties fair in 1893, was enough to set the crowd talking and the newspapers commenting. \n      Henri Fournier made the first sensational record in 1901 when he raced a mile in 51 4/5 seconds driving a gasoline automobile in Brooklyn. In the year following, Alexander Wilton covered five miles in five minutes and 29 1/5 seconds at Providence, Rhode Island and at Cleveland in the same year did 10 miles in a little over 10 minutes. The first long distance road race covered 225 miles in 15 hours and 11 minutes. \n      Automobile racing was popularized in those times by the efforts of many people involved in the auto industry. John O. Heinze, president of the Lowell Automobile Club and owner of Heinze Electric Company that made parts for Detroit car manufacturers was a major advocate for racing. A major question during the first decade of the century was whether or not automobile racing should be sanctioned and what benefit did racing offer to the user. Heinze's answer was that the rapid strides made in perfecting and making safe modern motor cars were the result of the many lessons learned in racing. \n      Heinze further believed that when people compared the 1909 models with ones built 10 years earlier, the improvements that had been achieved in such a short time were unimaginable. He also said that  \n   \n   \n running a motor car at continuously high speeds over ordinary roads would cause breakdowns to occur inside of 4 or 5 hours.  \n      Every instance of a breakdown forced auto technicians to invent better devices and systems that would enable the motor car to run longer and faster endurance trials. No doubt, to many people a road race and the motor car that won meant nothing, where to Heinze and his associates it was very important. The technology could only be improved by testing and the races served that purpose in a very romantic and publicized way. The 1908 and 1909 Lowell races were a major contributing factor to the development of the automobile. The races were not only entertainment, but were also technical achievements at the highest level for the times.  \n      The races were held under the auspices of the American Automobile Association and the Lowell Automobile Club. They were the first of such magnitude to be held in New England on the state highway that became known as the Merrimac Valley Course. Informal meetings were held between the newly formed Lowell Automobile Club led by Heinze  \n and enthusiasts from Boston. Arrangements were made to hold a 250 mile road race of national importance, and US Representative Butler Ames, himself an enthusiastic automobilist, promptly offered a valuable trophy as the first prize. \n   \n   \n      The necessary resolutions were introduced into the Lowell City Council and the Tyngsboro Board of Selectmen providing for the use of the highway on the day of the race. A request was also made of the \n adjutant general for the use of several militia companies to patrol the course during the day. At this point the committee met with two serious obstacles.

You know, there’s a lot of things I could say about Nick Faldo, but I’m not going to put myself down to his level.” \n Garcia’s team-mates leapt to his defence, with Graeme McDowell delivering the most caustic of ripostes to Faldo’s barb. \n The Northern Irishman, who made his Ryder Cup debut in 2008, recalled the moment Garcia and Lee Westwood were controversially dropped by Faldo at Valhalla. \n “You’ve got one of the best Ryder Cup pairings of all time being sat down on a Saturday of a Ryder Cup that we go on to lose,” he said. “I’d say Sergio was fairly useless that afternoon, yeah, because he wasn’t able to play. So, yeah, I agree.” \n McIlroy, the world No 1, also showed his support by throwing his arm around his partner and saying: “You’re not useless.” Garcia added with a smile: “Thanks, Nick. I love you, too.” \n The Spaniard delivered the perfect response to Faldo on the course by rescuing a wayward tee shot by McIlroy on the 18th and setting up a match-tying birdie. \n He said: “I needed to do something, find something in me, and obviously we got a little bit lucky, we’re not going to deny that. \n “We got a nice lie on 18 in the rough. But yeah, you still have to hit the shot and I was able to hit a really nice five-wood from 229, I think it was, in the wind off the left, which is always an uncomfortable wind. \n “I was trying to make sure I gave my partner a chance, a chance to make three, try to win the hole, and get a massive half after how well the team was doing in the afternoon. \n “So I was very pleased to see that.”  2008 Ryder Cup: The good and bad of European captain Nick ...2008 Ryder Cup: The good and bad of European captain Nick Faldo -", "parametric_answer": "colin montgomerie", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

Its message to mothers is that \"you know more than you think you do.\"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-14534094 Dr Spock's Baby and Child Care at 65] \n Spock was the first pediatrician to study psychoanalysis to try to understand children's needs and family dynamics. His ideas about childcare influenced several generations of parents to be more flexible and affectionate with their children, and to treat them as individuals.  However, they were also widely criticized by colleagues for relying too heavily on anecdotal evidence rather than serious academic research.  In addition to his pediatric work, Spock was an activist in the New Left and anti Vietnam War movements during the 1960s and early 1970s. At the time his books were criticized by Vietnam War supporters for allegedly propagating permissiveness and an expectation of instant gratification that led young people to join these movements, a charge Spock denied. Spock also won an Olympic gold medal in rowing in 1924 while attending Yale University. \n Biography \n Benjamin McLane Spock was born May 2, 1903, in New Haven, Connecticut; his parents were Benjamin Ives Spock, a Yale graduate and long-time general counsel of the New Haven Railroad, and Mildred Louise (Stoughton) Spock.  His name came from Dutch ancestry; they originally spelled the name Spaak before migrating to the former colony of New Netherland.  As the eldest of six children, Spock helped take care of his siblings in various ways. \n As did his father before him, Spock attended Phillips Andover Academy and Yale University. Spock studied literature and history at Yale, and also was active in athletics, becoming a part of the Olympic rowing crew (Men's Eights) that won a gold medal at the 1924 games in Paris. At Yale, he was inducted into the senior society Scroll and Key. He attended the Yale School of Medicine for two years before shifting to Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, from which he graduated first in his class in 1929. By that time, he had married Jane Cheney.  \n Jane Cheney married Spock in 1927 and assisted him in the research and writing of Dr. Spock's Baby & Child Care, which was published in 1946 by Duell, Sloan & Pearce as The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care. The book has sold more than 50 million copies in 49 languages. \n Jane Cheney Spock was a civil liberties advocate and mother of two sons.   She was born in Manchester, Connecticut, and attended Bryn Mawr College.  She was active in Americans for Democratic Action, the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy. After their divorce in 1976, she organized and ran support groups for older divorced women. \n In 1976, Spock married  Mary Morgan, who had formerly arranged speeches and workshops for him. They built a home in Esculapia Hollow, Arkansas, on Beaver lake, where Spock  and Morgan would row in Olympic training rowing shells early in the morning. Mary  quickly adapted to Spock's life of travel and political activism.  She was arrested with him many times for civil disobedience.  Once they were arrested in Washington, D.C. for praying on the White House lawn, along with other demonstrators.  When arrested, Morgan was strip searched; Spock was not.  She sued the jail and the mayor of Washington, D.C. for sex discrimination.  The American Civil Liberties Union took the case, and won.  Morgan also introduced Spock to massage, yoga, and a macrobiotic diet, and meditation, which reportedly improved his health. Mary scheduled his speaking dates and handled the legal  agreements  for Baby and Child Care for the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th editions.

{"question": "What is the least number of shots that a competitor can take to complete 18 holes of golf?", "answers": ["18"], "context": "How Long Does it Take to Play Golf? | GolfsmithHow Long Does it Take to Play Golf? | Golfsmith \n How Long Does it Take to Play Golf? \n How Long Does it Take to Play Golf? \n by William McCoy \n Landing in several bunkers can slow down your round of golf. \n Comstock/Comstock/Getty Images \n How Do You Play Skins in Golf? \n This article is one of our editor's top picks this month. \n The only honest answer to how long it takes to play a round of golf is: \"It takes as long as it takes.\" Golf isn't a timed game, like football or basketball, and there are many variables that can affect the amount of time a round can take. The difficulty of the course, the number of players in a group, the skill of the players, the number of holes played, and the pace of other parties of players on the course can all affect the total time of play, but some general observations made over centuries of golfing can at least lead to a fair estimate. \n Average Time \n Conventional wisdom holds that the average time to play a round of 18 holes of golf is approximately four hours. For example, the Hammock Creek golf club in Florida tracked average playing times by month for nearly two years, and the average worked out to four hours and eleven seconds. To finish a round in four hours, you'd need to spend an average of a little over 13 minutes on each hole. This amount would include the time walking or riding from hole to hole. To complete a round in four and a half hours, the average time per hole increases to 15 minutes. \n Course Variety \n All golf courses are not created equal. The USGA assigns slope ratings to golf courses that are an indication of the difficulty of a course. If you are playing a course that is rated as difficult, and you are not a scratch golfer, it's reasonable to expect a somewhat longer playing time than on a course that is not as challenging. There are also par-3 golf courses, where all holes are par-3, and \"executive\" courses, with par-3 and par-4 holes only, and these courses will play faster on average than a course that also has par-5 holes. Of course, playing nine holes is going to take less time than 18 holes any time, any place, and a capable golfer playing solo likely could play a brisk nine holes in about 90 minutes. \n Skill and Number in Party \n Scratch players are going to move through a course faster than players with 20 handicaps. It is going to take longer for a foursome to play a round of golf than it normally will for a single player or a pair to play the same course. Even the top pro tour players end up with balls in hazards, holes and heavy brush from time to time, but if your party has a player with a propensity for losing balls or hitting the hazards, an 18-hole round can stretch out to four and a half hours to even five hours or more. \n Other Considerations \n Often, the speed with which you complete your round of golf depends on a number of factors beyond just your ability. If one or more slow groups are playing ahead of you, you'll be forced to wait at each tee box, which results in a longer round. If there's inclement weather that forces you to take shelter or the members of your foursome are overly conversational, your round won't be quick. Also, the time of year and where you play can influence the time it takes to play a round of golf. For example, it's not uncommon for five-hour rounds in Northern states in metropolitan areas during the summer because of the demand for tee times. In a state such as Florida, playing in the heat of the summer usually means courses are fairly devoid of golfers, which means faster rounds, but in the winter, with residents sharing courses with seasonal visitors, a round will take longer. \n HOT PRODUCTS ON Golfsmith.com  Golf Vocabulary | English ClubGolf Vocabulary | English Club \n 1000 Phrasal Verbs", "parametric_answer": "13", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

In 1909, Florence Nightingale Graham dropped out of nursing school in Toronto. \n She then joined her elder brother in New York City, working briefly as a bookkeeper for the E.R. Squibb Pharmaceuticals Company. While there, she spent hours in their lab, learning about skincare. She then worked - again briefly - for Eleanor Adair, an early beauty culturist, as a \"treatment girl\". \n In 1909 Arden formed a partnership with Elizabeth Hubbard, another culturist. When the partnership dissolved, she coined the business name \"Elizabeth Arden\" from her former partner and from Tennyson's poem \"Enoch Arden\". \n In 1912 Arden travelled to France to learn beauty and facial massage techniques used in the Paris beauty salons. She returned with a collection of rouges and tinted powders she had created. In an era when it was generally only acceptable for entertainers to wear makeup, Arden introduced modern eye makeup to North America. She also introduced the concept of the \"makeover\" in her salons. \n In 1915 she married Thomas J. Lewis, a banker, thus becoming an American citizen. Arden's drive for success cost her marriage to Lewis. They divorced in 1934. A second marriage to a Russian prince only lasted 2 years. \n Arden collaborated with A. Fabian Swanson, a chemist, to create a \"fluffy\" face cream. The success of the cream, Venetian Cream Amoretta, and corresponding lotion, Arden Skin Tonic, led to a long-lasting business relationship. This revolutionized cosmetics, bringing a scientific approach to formulations. Other innovations included creating foundations that matched a person's skin tone; creating the idea of the \"Total Look\" in which lip, cheek, and fingernail colors matched or coordinated; and the first to make a cosmetics commercial shown in movie houses. \n During World War II, Arden recognized the changing needs of the American woman entering the work force. She showed women how to apply makeup and dress appropriately for careers outside the home. She created a lipstick called Montezuma Red, for the women in the armed forces that would match the red on their uniforms. Although most of her commercial success was in cosmetics, she also pioneered restorative musical exercises based on yoga. She started a fashion business in 1943 with notable designers like Charles James and Oscar de la Renta on staff. \n She began expanding her international operations in 1915, and started opening salons across the world. By the end of 1930s, it was said that \"There are only three American names that are known in every single corner of the globe: Singer sewing machines, Coca Cola, and Elizabeth Arden.\" A fact proved by Heinrich Harrer in his book Seven Years in Tibet, where he stated that it's possible to buy Arden's productsï¿½even in Tibet. At the peak of her career, she had a salon in New York, Washington, Boston, Chicago, Beverly Hills, San Francisco, Maine, Arizona, Phoenix, Southhampton, Surfside, Florida, Palm Beach, Philadelphia, Honolulu, Lima.

We will not keep you in suspense. \n Standard modern pianos have 88 keys. \n But this answer is not comprehensive, because there are also pianos with other numbers of keys. If you want to know more about this musical instrument, keep on reading. \n Invention of a Piano \n Bartolomeo Cristofori, a harpsichord maker from Padua, Italy, is said to be the inventor of the modern variant of the piano. Nobody can say when exactly this happened, but it is known that by 1700 the Medici family, whom he worked for, had such an instrument. First pianos had wooden frames and unique keyboard mechanisms. In general, they resembled clavichords, which had been invented formerly. Since that time their design and functionality have undergone significant changes. \n Layout of Keys on a Piano \n You have already read above that a standard piano has 88 keys. But if you want to understand their layout better, you should get some more information about the instrument. \n First keyboards of early musical instruments had no black keys on them, and the key layout of those times consisted of seven notes. The modern variant was established in the 13th century in Europe. It consisted of twelve notes. Seven white keys and five black keys form an octave. As you already know, now pianos have 88 keys, that is, 7¼ octaves. As a rule, there are 52 white keys and 36 black keys on a regular piano. \n Unusual Pianos \n However, not only standard 88 key pianos are used now. Some well-known piano makers produce instruments with different number of keys. For example, there are 92 of them in Bösendorfer 225, and even 97 keys in Bösendorfer 290. The so-called “Cottage piano” misses bottom octave and top octave and has only 64 keys. Many years ago the Pleyel Company made the double grand piano, which combined two pianos. It had 176 piano keys. \n Nowadays, there are two basic categories of pianos: grand and upright. They are usually subdivided into baby grand, concert grand, small upright and large upright. The table below will give you some information about them. \n Type  How Many Keys Are on a Piano - BuzzleHow Many Keys Are on a Piano \n Follow Us \n How Many Keys Are on a Piano \n Before you begin your piano lessons, it is important to learn how many keys there are on it. It may seem a very childish question to ask, but not many are able to answer it correctly. \n Advertisement \n It is said that in the year 1709, an Italian harpsichord maker, Bartolomeo Cristofori, invented the 'pianoforte'. This new musical instrument had a wooden frame like a harpsichord and a unique keyboard mechanism. It was very similar to the clavichord. Over the past 300 years, the pianoforte has undergone many changes. The shape, functionality, appearance, design, and sound has been modified into today's version of the piano. \n Layout of Piano Keys \n The modern piano keyboard was first established in medieval Europe during the 13th century. It had 12 basic notes, with a repetition of black and white keys. During the early stages, there were no black notes implemented as yet. Therefore, the layout of keys consisted of only seven basic notes. Then, after many long years, keyboard players were finally able to decide and implement the number of musical notes one could play on the piano. Thus, today there are 7 ¼ octaves, i.e., seven white notes and five black notes to an octave. This has made learning to play the piano so easy that you can even learn it yourself. \n Total Number of Keys \n The total number of keys on a standard modern piano is 88, the break-up being 52 white keys and 36 black keys.

One match is played on the Sunday before Labour Day and two on Labour Day. \n Public Life \n Post offices, many businesses, and many organizations are closed on Labour Day in Canada. Schools and other educational establishments are also closed, as Labour Day falls at the end of the summer holiday period. Many public transport services run to a reduced or \"Sunday\" service, although others may not run at all. There may be some local disruption to traffic around parades, particularly in Toronto, and some congestion on highways and at airports as people return form late summer vacations or trips. \n Background \n The origins of Labour Day can be traced back to April 15, 1872, when the Toronto Trades Assembly organized Canada's first significant demonstration for worker's rights. The aim of the demonstration was to release the 24 leaders of the Toronto Typographical Union who were imprisoned for striking to campaign for a nine-hour working day. At this time, trade unions were still illegal and striking was seen as a criminal conspiracy to disrupt trade. In spite of this, the Toronto Trades Assembly was already a significant organization and encouraged workers to form trade unions, mediated in disputes between employers and employees and signaled the mistreatment of workers. \n There was enormous public support for the parade and the authorities could no longer deny the important role that the trade unions had to play in the emerging Canadian society. A few months later, a similar parade was organized in Ottawa and passed the house of Canada’s first prime minister, Sir John Macdonald. Later in the day, he appeared before the gathering and promised to repeal all Canadian laws against trade unions. This happened in the same year and eventually led to the founding of the Canadian Labour Congress in 1883. \n Labour Day was originally celebrated in the spring but it was moved to the fall after 1894. A similar holiday, Labor Day is held on the same day in the United States of America. Canadian trade unions are proud that this holiday was inspired by their efforts to improve workers' rights.

At the height of its power in the 14th and 15th centuries, the Crown of Aragon was a thalassocracy (a state with primarily maritime realms) controlling a large portion of present-day eastern Spain,  parts of what is now southern France, and a Mediterranean \"empire\" which included the Balearic Islands, Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia, Malta, Southern Italy (from 1442) and parts of Greece (until 1388). The component realms of the Crown were not united politically except at the level of the king, who ruled over each autonomous polity according to its own laws, raising funds under each tax structure, dealing separately with each Corts or Cortes. Put in contemporary terms, it has sometimes been considered that the different lands of the Crown of Aragon (mainly the Kingdom of Aragon, the Principality of Catalonia and the Kingdom of Valencia) functioned more as a confederation than as a single kingdom. In this sense, the larger Crown of Aragon must not be confused with one of its constituent parts, the Kingdom of Aragon, from which it takes its name. \n In 1469, a new dynastic familial union of the Crown of Aragon with the Crown of Castile by the Catholic Monarchs, joining what contemporaries referred to as \"the Spains\"  led to what would become the Kingdom of Spain under King Philip II. The Crown existed until it was abolished by the Nueva Planta decrees issued by King Philip V in 1716 as a consequence of the defeat of Archduke Charles (as Charles III of Aragon) in the War of the Spanish Succession. \n Context \n Formally, the political center of the Crown of Aragon was Zaragoza, where kings were crowned at La Seo Cathedral. Leading cultural, administrative and economic centres of the Crown of Aragon were the cities of Barcelona and Valencia.  Finally, Palma (Majorca) was an additional important  city  and seaport. \n The Crown of Aragon eventually included the Kingdom of Aragon, the Principality of Catalonia (until the 12th century as County of Barcelona), the Kingdom of Valencia, the Kingdom of Majorca, the Kingdom of Sicily, Malta, the Kingdom of Naples and Kingdom of Sardinia. For brief periods the Crown of Aragon also controlled Montpellier, Provence, Corsica, and the twin Duchy of Athens and Neopatras in Latin Greece. \n The countries that are today known as Spain and Portugal spent the Middle Ages after 722 in an intermittent struggle called the Reconquista. This struggle pitted the northern Christian kingdoms against the Islamic taifa petty kingdoms of the South and against each other. \n In the Late Middle Ages, the expansion of the Aragonese Crown southwards met with the Castilian advance eastward in the region of Murcia. Afterward, the Aragonese Crown focused on the Mediterranean, acting as far as Greece and Barbary, whereas Portugal, which completed its Reconquista in 1249, would focus on the Atlantic Ocean. Mercenaries from the territories in the Crown, known as almogàvers participated in the creation of this Mediterranean \"empire\", and later found employment in countries all across southern Europe. \n The Crown of Aragon has been considered by some as an empire which ruled in the Mediterranean for hundreds of years, with the power to set rules over the entire sea (for instance, the Llibre del Consolat del Mar or Book of the Consulate of the Sea, written in Catalan, is one of the oldest compilation of maritime laws in the world). It was indeed, at its height, one of the major powers in Europe. \n However, its different territories were only connected through the person of the monarch, an aspect of empire as early as Achaemenid Persia. A contemporary, the Marqués de Lozoya  described the Crown of Aragon as being more like a confederacy than a centralised kingdom, let alone an empire.

Newton wrote the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, in which he described universal gravitation and the three laws of motion, laying the groundwork for classical mechanics. By deriving Kepler's laws of planetary motion from this system, he was the first to show that the motion of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws. The unifying and deterministic power of his laws was integral to the scientific revolution and the advancement of heliocentrism. \n Among other scientific discoveries, Newton realized that the spectrum of colors observed when white light passes through a prism is inherent in the white light and not added by the prism (as Roger Bacon had claimed in the thirteenth century), and notably argued that light is composed of particles. \n He also developed a law of cooling, describing the rate of cooling of objects when exposed to air. \n He enunciated the principles of conservation of momentum and angular momentum. \n Finally, he studied the speed of sound in air, and voiced a theory of the origin of stars. \n Despite this renown in mainstream science, Newton actually spent more time working on alchemy than physics, writing considerably more papers on the former than the latter. \n Newton played a major role in the development of calculus, sharing credit with Gottfried Leibniz. He also made contributions to other areas of mathematics, for example the generalized binomial theorem. The mathematician and mathematical physicist Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736-1813), said that \"Newton was the greatest genius that ever existed and the most fortunate, for we cannot find more than once a system of the world to establish.\" \n Early Years \n Born in the hamlet of Woolsthorpe, Newton was the only son of a local yeoman, also Isaac Newton, who had died three months before, and of Hannah Ayscough. That same year, at Arcetri near Florence, Galileo Galilei had died; Newton would eventually pick up his idea of a mathematical science of motion and bring his work to full fruition. A tiny and weak baby, Newton was not expected to survive his first day of life, much less 84 years. \n Education \n From the age of about twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at The King's School in Grantham (where his signature can still be seen upon a library window sill). He was removed from school and by Oct 1659 he was to be found at Woolsthorpe, where his mother attempted to make a farmer of him. He was, by later reports of his contemporaries, thoroughly unhappy with the work. It appears to be Henry Stokes, master at the King's School, who persuaded his mother to send him back to school so that he might complete his education. \n In June 1661 he matriculated to Trinity College, Cambridge. At that time, the college's teachings were based on those of Aristotle, but Newton preferred to read the more advanced ideas of modern philosophers such as Descartes and astronomers such as Galileo, Copernicus and Kepler. \n When Newton arrived in Cambridge in 1661, the movement now known as the scientific revolution was well advanced, and many of the works basic to modern science had appeared. Astronomers from Copernicus to Kepler had elaborated the heliocentric system of the universe. Galileo had proposed the foundations of a new mechanics built on the principle of inertia. Led by Descartes, philosophers had begun to formulate a new conception of nature as an intricate, impersonal, and inert machine. Yet as far as the universities of Europe, including Cambridge, were concerned, all this might well have never happened. They continued to be the strongholds of outmoded Aristotelianism, which rested on a geocentric view of the universe and dealt with nature in qualitative rather than quantitative terms. \n Like thousands of other undergraduates, Newton began his higher education by immersing himself in Aristotle's work.

The rings of Saturn have fascinated stargazers for centuries, ever since telescopes were first pointed toward the sky. \n When Galileo Galilei first observed Saturn in 1610, he thought that the rings were enormous moons, one positioned on each side of the planet. Over several years of observations, he noted that the rings changed shape and even disappeared , as they changed their inclination with respect to Earth. \n We now know that Galileo was observing a \"ring plane crossing.\" Saturn's equator is tilted relative to its orbit around the sun by 27 degrees – similar to Earth's 23-degree tilt. As Saturn circles the sun, first one hemisphere and then the other is tilted sunward. The tilt causes seasons, just as it does on Earth, and when Saturn reaches equinox, its equator and ring plane are directly in line with the sun. Sunlight hits the rings edge-on, and the fine line of the rings is difficult to detect. The rings are wide — 170,000 miles across (273,600 km) — but only about 30 feet (10 meters) thick. \n In 1655, astronomer Christaan Huygens suggested that the strange bodies were solid, inclined rings, and in 1660 another astronomer suggested that the rings were made up of small satellites, an insight that wasn't confirmed for nearly 200 years. \n In modern times, Pioneer 11 passed through the Saturn ring plane in 1979. In the 1980s, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 glimpsed the planet's ring system. \n In 2004, NASA's Cassini-Huygens mission became the first to enter orbit around Saturn, taking detailed observations not only of the planet but of its ring system. \n Details of Saturn's icy rings are visible in this sweeping view from Cassini of the planet's glorious ring system. The total span, from A ring to F ring, covers approximately 40,800 miles (65,700 km) and was photographed at Nov. 26, 2008. \n Credit: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute \n Composition and structure \n Saturn's rings are made up of billions of particles ranging from grains of sand to mountain-size chunks. Composed predominantly of water-ice, the rings also draw in rocky meteoroids as they travel through space. \n Though Saturn appears surrounded by a single, solid ring when viewed by an amateur astronomer, several divisions exist. The rings are named alphabetically in the order of discovery. Thus the main rings are, from farthest from the planet to closest, A, B and C. A gap 2,920 miles wide (4,700 kilometers), known as the Cassini Division, separates the A and B rings. \n Other, fainter rings have been discovered as telescope technology has improved. Voyager 1 detected the innermost D ring in 1980. The F ring lies just outside of the A ring, while the G and E ring lay even farther out. \n The rings themselves contain a number of gaps and structures . Some are created by Saturn's many small moons, while others continue to puzzle to astronomers. \n Saturn is not the only planet in the solar system to have rings — Jupiter , Uranus and Neptune also contain faint ring systems — but with its satellites spanning three-quarters of the Earth-moon distance (175,000 miles or 282,000 km), it is by far the largest and most visible. \n Formation theories \n Several hypotheses exist as to the how Saturn's rings were formed.

Agassi has described the first three of them as \"guinea pigs\" in the development of the methods he used to mold Andre into a world-class tennis player. His book The Agassi Story was published in 2004.  Andre AgassiAndre Kirk Agassi (; born April 29, 1970) is an American retired professional tennis player and former World No. 1, who was one of the game's most dominant players from the early 1990s to the mid-2000s.  Generally considered by critics and fellow players to be one of the greatest tennis players of all time,      Agassi had been called the greatest service returner in the history of the game.    Described by the BBC upon his retirement as \"perhaps the biggest worldwide star in the sport's history\", Agassi compiled performances that, along with his unorthodox apparel and attitude, saw him cited as one of the most charismatic players in the history of the game. As a result, he is credited for helping to revive the popularity of tennis during the 1990s.  \n In singles tennis, Agassi is an eight-time Grand Slam champion and a 1996 Olympic gold medalist, as well as finishing runner-up in seven other Grand Slam tournaments. During the Open Era, Agassi is the first male player to win 4 Australian Open titles and those were an Open Era record until Novak Djokovic won his 5th title on February 1, 2015. Agassi is one of five male singles players to achieve the Career Grand Slam in the Open Era and one of eight in history,   the first of two to achieve the Career Golden Slam (Career Grand Slam and Olympic Gold Medal), and the only man to win the Career Golden Slam and the ATP Tour World Championships (won in 1990): a distinction dubbed as a \"Career Super Slam\" by Sports Illustrated. \n Agassi was the first male player to win all four Grand Slam tournaments on three different surfaces (hard, clay and grass), and the last American male to win the French Open, in 1999  and the Australian Open (2003).  He also won 17 ATP Masters Series titles and was part of a winning Davis Cup team in 1990, 1992 and 1995. Agassi reached the World No. 1 ranking for the first time in 1995 but was troubled by personal issues during the mid-to-late 1990s and sank to World No. 141 in 1997, prompting many to believe that his career was over. Agassi returned to World No. 1 in 1999 and enjoyed the most successful run of his career over the next four years.

I planted this native to help fill in my once-sparse forest understory layer and to provide food for wildlife. It fulfills both these goals admirably and offers landscape value too. Summer leaves are glossy, reflecting light beneath the shade of a large red maple. Its fall color is a deep maroon that develops after most other deciduous trees have lost their leaves for the season. The flowers and fruits are also quite eye-catching. \n Typical viburnum white flat-topped flower clusters glow softly in the growing shade of late spring, attracting myriad insect visitors. These busy pollinators ensure excellent fruit set. Individual fruits start out pinkish-red and mature to a dark blue. Here’s a close-up of some fruit clusters on my specimen: \n Fruits start out pink and ripen to blue \n You may notice that the above shot doesn’t show many blue fruits. I think that’s because the birds are eating them as soon as they are fully ripe. All the fruit-eating birds — from robins to cardinals to woodpeckers (oh yes, they love fruits) argue over who gets to devour the blue drupes. The common name — Possumhaw — refers to the fact that possums and raccoons also enjoy these fruits. Deer will browse the entire plant — mine is now tall enough that they can’t reach it all. \n That common name — Possumhaw — is shared by another native shrub of our moist spots. It’s a completely different species — a deciduous holly, also commonly called Winterberry, for the fact that its bright red berries linger on the branches after the leaves fall. The fruits of this holly (Ilex decidua) are not as enthusiastically devoured as its same-named viburnum counterpart, but they do eventually get eaten as winter progresses. \n Some folks call Winterberry Possumhaw Holly to distinguish it from Possumhaw Viburnum, but you’ll also find both shrubs/trees referred to simply as Possumhaw. The “possum” front end of the name seems likely to refer to one of the critters that likes to eat it, but I found myself wondering about the “haw” part. \n It seemed likely that “haw” referred to the fruit, but that confused me because the hollies produce individual berry-like drupes that ripen from green to red, and the viburnum in question produces clusters of berry-like drupes that ripen from reddish-pink to blue. How can these both be haws? \n A quick survey via my favorite search engine provided an answer. Apparently, the English colonists who settled this region weren’t interested in finer botanical distinctions. If an animal or plant reminded them of one from back home in England, they tended to call it by that old familiar name. That’s how our American Robin got its name, even though it’s not remotely kin (nor that physically similar) to the European Robin. \n And it’s also why several bushes with red fruits — at any stage of their ripening process — got called Haws. You see, the European Hawthorn they grew up with produces red fruits they called Haws, so anything in the New World of about the same size and character with red fruits was called a Haw. As for the “Possum” part of Possumhaw, I imagine that the colonists either observed these creatures eating the fruits, or found them inside their stomachs when they prepared the possums for cooking. \n All this is a long-winded way of telling you that common names of plants", "parametric_answer": "holly", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

He became the most popular character in the series, and the accompanying television spin-off series, Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends . \n Thomas is a tank engine , painted blue with red lining, and displays the running number one. All of the locomotives in The Railway Series were based on prototypical engines; Thomas has origins in the E2 Class designed by Lawson Billinton in 1913. \n Thomas first appeared in 1946 in the second book in the series, Thomas the Tank Engine , and was the focus of the four short stories contained within. \n In 1979, the British writer/producer Britt Allcroft came across the books, [2] and arranged a deal to bring the stories to life as Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends (later simplified to Thomas and Friends). The programme became an award-winning hit around the world, with a vast range of spin-off commercial products. \n Contents \n   Prototype and backstory \n   E2 0-6-0T \n When Awdry created Thomas, the engine existed only as a wooden toy made for his son Christopher . This engine looked rather different from the character in the books and television series, and carried the letters NW on its side tanks. Awdry claimed that this stood for \"No Where\"; as the Railway Series and its backstory developed, the railway Thomas and his friends worked on became known as the North Western Railway . [3] \n Thomas wasn't originally based on a prototype ; rather, the initial stories were an accompaniment to the toy made for Christopher. [4] After Awdry's wife encouraged him to publish the stories, [5] the publisher of the second book in The Railway Series, Thomas the Tank Engine , hired an illustrator named Reginald Payne. Awdry selected a real locomotive for Payne to work from to create authenticity; a Billinton designed 0-6-0 E2 Class of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway . This may have been chosen simply because Awdry had a photograph to hand. [4] Thomas is one of half a dozen locomotives fitted with an extension to the front of the water tanks. [6] While the language used and the behaviours exhibited often closely resemble those of real locomotives [7] there are some significant and artistic differences. For example, Thomas's wheels are driven by internal cylinders typical of such tank engines. The cranks and connecting rods are therefore not externally visible. \n Awdry was unsatisfied with one detail of the illustration—the fact that the front end of his footplate featured a downward slope, which meant that his front and back buffers were at different levels. This was an illustrator's mistake that was perpetuated in subsequent books. The accident, in \" Thomas Comes to Breakfast \" was partly devised as a means of correcting this. Thomas has always been shown with a curved front buffer beam in the television series. \n Unfortunately, despite creating the visual image of such an iconic character, Payne did not receive any credit for his work, and it is only since the publication of Brian Sibley 's The Thomas the Tank Engine Man that he has started to receive major recognition. It had often been erroneously assumed that C. Reginald Dalby created the character, as he was responsible for illustrating books 3–11 and repainting the illustrations of book 1. \n Thomas arrived on Sodor in 1915, when the Fat Controller bought the locomotive for a nominal sum to be a pilot engine at Vicarstown . After rescuing James in Thomas & the Breakdown Train , he became a \"Really Useful Engine\" and was rewarded by being put in charge of the Ffarquhar branchline . Although Thomas is seen today on various heritage railways , the last of the LB&SCR E2 class was scrapped in 1963.

Present were James Winston [a former strolling player, manager & important theatre antiquarian], Samuel James Arnold [playwright & theatre manager], Samuel Beazley [architect & playwright], Sir Andrew Francis Barnard [officer hero of the Peninsular Wars & Waterloo], and Francis Mills [timber merchant & railway speculator]. It was decided to write down a number of names in order to invite them to be original members of the Garrick Club. The avowed purpose of the Club was to \"tend to the regeneration of the Drama.\" [1] \n The Club was named in honour of the eminent actor David Garrick whose acting and management at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in the previous century, had by the 1830s come to represent a golden age of British drama. Less than six months later the members had been recruited and a Club House found and equipped on King Street in Covent Garden. On February 1, 1832 it was reported that the novelist and journalist Thomas Gaspey was the first member to enter at 11am, and that “Mr Beazley gave the first order, (a mutton chop) at ½ past 12.” \n The list of those that took up original membership runs like a Who’s Who of the Green Room for 1832: actors such as John Braham , Charles Kemble , William Charles Macready , Charles Mathews and his son Charles James; the playwrights James Robinson Planché , Theodore Hook and Thomas Noon Talfourd ; scene-painters including Clarkson Stanfield and Thomas Grieve. Even the patron, the Duke of Sussex , had an element of the theatrical about him, being a well known mesmerist. To this can be added numerous Barons, Counts, Dukes, Earls and Lords, soldiers, parliamentarians, and judges. \n The membership would later include the like of Charles Kean , Henry Irving , Beerbohm Tree , Arthur Sullivan , JM Barrie , AW Pinero , Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud . From the literary world came writers such as Charles Dickens , William Makepeace Thackeray , Anthony Trollope , HG Wells and AA Milne ; the art world has been represented by painters such as John Everett Millais , Lord Leighton and Dante Gabriel Rossetti . \n The Club’s popularity at the beginning of the 1860’s created an overcrowding of its original club-house. Slum clearance being undertaken just round the corner provided the opportunity to move into a brand new purpose built home on what became known as Garrick Street. The move was completed in 1864 and the Club remains in this building today. \n Today the Club has around 1,300 members who continue to be drawn from across the same varied spectrum. All new candidates must be proposed by an existing member before election in a secret ballot. At present the Club remains “gentlemen only”, although Lady guests are welcome in most parts of the Club. This exclusive nature of the club was highlighted when reporter Jeremy Paxman applied to join but was initially blackballed: one member was recorded as saying that, \"he was full of himself\". [2] Paxman was later admitted, an experience he shares with Sir Henry Irving who despite being the first actor to receive a knighthood had himself been blackballed in 1873. \n The Club holds a remarkable collection of art works representing the history of the British theatre. There are over 1000 paintings, drawings and sculptures, a fascinating selection of theatrical memorabilia, and thousands of prints and photographs. [3] \n The collection originated with the actor Charles Mathews , one of the original members of the Club who had a passion for collecting theatrical portraits; they were once displayed by him in a gallery at his home, Ivy Cottage, in Highgate, North London. Mathews managed to secure a large number of pictures from the collection of Thomas Harris, who had been manager of Theatre Royal, Covent Garden , and which included paintings by the likes of Johan Zoffany , Francis Hayman and Gainsborough Dupont.

{"question": "What amateur rowing club based at Henley on Thames, England, was founded in 1818?", "answers": ["leander club"], "context": "Leander Club | Wiki | Everipedia, the encyclopedia of ...Leander Club | Wiki | Everipedia \n × \n Want to change something on this page or create your own? Register today, it's fast and free. \n Leander Club \n See below \n Leander Club, founded in 1818, [2] is one of the oldest rowing clubs in the world. It is based in Remenham in Berkshire , England and adjoins Henley-on-Thames . Only three other surviving clubs were founded prior to Leander: Brasenose College Boat Club and Jesus College Boat Club (the two competing in a Head race in 1815) and Westminster School Boat Club , founded in 1813. \n History \n Leander was founded on the Tideway in 1818 or 1819 by members of the old \"Star\" and \"Arrow\" Clubs and membership was at first limited to sixteen. [3] \"The Star\" and \"the Arrow\" clubs died out sometime in the 1820s and Leander itself was in full swing by 1825. By 1830 it was looked upon as a well-known and long-established boat club. \n In its early days, Leander was as much a social association as a competitive club and it was steered by a waterman . It was the first club to support young watermen and instituted a coat and badge for scullers. In 1831 Leander defeated Oxford University in a race rowed from Hambleden Lock to Henley Bridge , but when it lost the match with Cambridge six years later, Lord Esher noted at a dinner that Leander was: \n \"a London Club consisting of men who had never been at the University but ... were recognised throughout England, and perhaps everywhere in the world, as the finest rowers who had up to that time been seen.\" \n However, he also noted that they were 'verging on being middle aged men.' [3] Up until 1856 the number of members was limited to twenty-five men. After this date membership was increased to thirty-five and the limit finally abolished in 1862. In 1858 Leander began to recruit members from both Oxford University and Cambridge University . \n Its first home is assumed to have been Searle's yard, Stangate — on the south bank of the River Thames (on land currently occupied by St Thomas's Hospital ). In 1860 the membership moved the club to Putney where a small piece of land was rented on which a tent was erected for housing boats. This land was bought by London Rowing Club in 1864 and is the site of LRC's current clubhouse. Leander were able to lease a piece of land adjoining and in 1866 started to construct a boathouse. Thirty years later, in 1897, the club purchased land in Henley-on-Thames and built its current clubhouse. The club's centre of gravity moved rapidly to Henley, although the Putney boathouse was retained until 1961. \n Leander entered a crew at Henley Royal Regatta for the first time in 1840, the year following the regatta's foundation. Their crew which won the Grand Challenge Cup included Thomas Lowther Jenkins in the 5 seat. Jenkins' winner's medal was discovered in a Belfast junk shop more than 130 years later by a Member who donated it to the Club, where it sits in one of the trophy cabinets. \n For the first 179 years of its existence it was a male-only club but opened its doors to women members in 1998 in recognition of the emergence and strength of the GB women's rowing team, and not because of financial considerations as the UK's Sports Council rules required organizations receiving funding to have an open membership policy, as was commonly reported in the press at that time. On 1 January 2013 Debbie Flood was elected as the club's first female captain, and was re-elected the following year. \n Leander was one of five clubs which retained the right until 2012 to appoint representatives to the Council of British Rowing . The others were London Rowing Club , Thames Rowing Club , Oxford University Boat Club and Cambridge University Boat Club .

The citizens refer to themselves as Batswana (singular: Motswana).  Formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, Botswana adopted its new name after becoming independent within the Commonwealth on 30 September 1966.  Since then, it has maintained a strong tradition of stable representative democracy, with a consistent record of uninterrupted democratic elections. \n Botswana is topographically flat, with up to 70 percent of its territory being the Kalahari Desert. It is bordered by South Africa to the south and southeast, Namibia to the west and north, and Zimbabwe to the northeast. Its border with Zambia to the north near Kazungula is poorly defined but at most is a few hundred metres long.  \n A mid-sized country of just over 2 million people, Botswana is one of the most sparsely populated nations in the world. Around 10 percent of the population lives in the capital and largest city, Gaborone. Formerly one of the poorest countries in the world—with a GDP per capita of about US$70 per year in the late 1960s—Botswana has since transformed itself into one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, now boasting a GDP (purchasing power parity) per capita of about $18,825 per year , which is one of the highest in Africa. Its high gross national income (by some estimates the fourth-largest in Africa) gives the country a modest standard of living and the highest Human Development Index of continental Sub-Saharan Africa.  \n Botswana is a member of the African Union, the Southern African Development Community, the Commonwealth of Nations, and the United Nations. Despite its political stability and relative socioeconomic prosperity,  the country has been among the hardest hit by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The death rate due to AIDS or AIDS-related causes has fallen sharply (57%) from 2005 to 2013. and the number of new infections in children has also fallen. Despite the success in programmes to make treatments available to those infected, and to educate the populace in general about how to stop the spread of HIV AIDS, the number of people with AIDS rose from 290,000 in 2005 to 320,000 in 2013. Despite these reasons for hope, Botswana has the third highest prevalence rate for HIV AIDS, reported in 2014. \n History \n In the 19th century, hostilities broke out between Tswana inhabitants of Botswana and Ndebele tribes who were making incursions into the territory from the north-east. Tensions also escalated with the Dutch Boer settlers from the Transvaal to the east. After appeals by the Batswana leaders Khama III, Bathoen and Sebele for assistance, the British Government put Bechuanaland under its protection on 31 March 1885.  The northern territory remained under direct administration as the Bechuanaland Protectorate and is modern-day Botswana, while the southern territory became part of the Cape Colony and is now part of the northwest province of South Africa. The majority of Setswana-speaking people today live in South Africa. \n When the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910 out of the main British colonies in the region, the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Basutoland (now Lesotho) and Swaziland (the High Commission Territories) were not included, but provision was made for their later incorporation. However, their inhabitants began to be consulted by the UK, and although successive South African governments sought to have the territories transferred, the UK kept delaying; consequently, it never occurred. The election of the Nationalist government in 1948, which instituted apartheid, and South Africa's withdrawal from the Commonwealth in 1961, ended any prospect of incorporation of the territories into South Africa. An expansion of British central authority and the evolution of tribal government resulted in the 1920 establishment of two advisory councils to represent both Africans and Europeans. Proclamations in 1934 regulated tribal rule and powers. A European-African advisory council was formed in 1951, and the 1961 constitution established a consultative legislative council. \n In June 1964, the UK accepted proposals for a democratic self-government in Botswana. The seat of government was moved in 1965 from Mafikeng in South Africa, to the newly established Gaborone,", "parametric_answer": "mozambique", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}
{"question": "\"Who wrote the piece of music recognised in much of the Western world as \"\"The Wedding March\"\" (or as \"\"Here Comes The Bride\"\")?\"", "answers": ["mendelssohn"], "context": "Bridal ChorusThe \"Bridal Chorus\" () from the 1850 opera Lohengrin by German composer Richard Wagner is a march played for the bride's entrance at many formal weddings throughout the Western world. In English-speaking countries it is generally known as \"Here Comes the Bride\" or \"Wedding March\", though \"wedding march\" refers to any piece in march tempo accompanying the entrance or exit of the bride, notably Felix Mendelssohn's \"Wedding March\". The piece was made popular when it was used as the processional at the wedding of Victoria the Princess Royal to Prince Frederick William of Prussia in 1858.  \n The chorus is sung in Lohengrin by the women of the wedding party after the ceremony, as they accompany the heroine Elsa to the bridal chamber. \n Text \n Although at most weddings the chorus is usually played on an organ without vocal singing, in Lohengrin the wedding party sings these words at the beginning of act three. \n Eight women then sing a blessing to a separate melody. \n The chorus then repeats the first section, gradually proceeding offstage. \n Religious attitudes  \n Many pastors of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod oppose the \"Bridal Chorus\" because of both pre-First World War Lutheran opposition to the theater and the pagan elements of Wagner's operas.  The Roman Catholic Church generally does not use the \"Bridal Chorus\"; one diocese's guidelines regarding the chorus states that the chorus is a secular piece of music, that it is not a processional to the altar in the opera, and especially that its frequent use in film and television associate it with sentimentality rather than worship.  The song is also not used in Eastern Orthodox weddings.  Wedding March (Mendelssohn)Felix Mendelssohn's \"Wedding March\" in C major, written in 1842, is one of the best known of the pieces from his suite of incidental music (Op. 61) to Shakespeare's play A Midsummer Night's Dream. It is one of the most frequently used wedding marches, generally being played on a church pipe organ.  \n At weddings in many Western countries, this piece is commonly used as a recessional, though frequently stripped of its episodes in this context. It is frequently teamed with the \"Bridal Chorus\" from Richard Wagner's opera Lohengrin,  or with Jeremiah Clarke's \"Prince of Denmark's March\",  both of which are often played for the entry of the bride.  \n The first time that Mendelssohn's \"Wedding March\" was used at a wedding was when Dorothy Carew wed Tom Daniel at St Peter's Church, Tiverton, England, on 2 June 1847 when it was performed by organist Samuel Reay. However, it did not become popular at weddings until it was selected by Victoria, The Princess Royal for her marriage to Prince Frederick William of Prussia on 25 January 1858.  The bride was the daughter of Queen Victoria, who loved Mendelssohn's music and for whom Mendelssohn often played while on his visits to Britain. \n An organ on which Mendelssohn gave recitals of the \"Wedding March\", among other works, is housed in St Ann's Church in Tottenham. \n Franz Liszt wrote a virtuoso transcription of the \"Wedding March and Dance of the Elves\" (S. 410) in 1849-50.  Vladimir Horowitz transcribed the Wedding March into a virtuoso showpiece for piano and played it as an encore at his concerts.

It usually lists the debits and credits associated with the entity for which the transactions are being recorded. Ledgers were traditionally on paper and often entered in bound books. With the start of the computer age, electronic versions became more common. \n There are three common types of ledger: general, purchase, and sales ledgers. Often all three of these are used together. The general ledger is the most elaborate, while purchase and sales ledgers record the transactions of only creditors and customers respectively. \n The general ledger is typically organized by the five different kinds of accounts: assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and owner’s equity. Some general ledgers will also show gains and losses. It uses a style of input known as double-entry bookkeeping . This means that if something is taken away from one account then it must be added to another. The standard format is for the debit entries to appear in a column on the left side and the credits on the right. \n A purchase ledger tracks all amounts that are paid and owed to a credit supplier. This can be one book with several categories or a series of books so that there is one for each supplier. Common entries include information from invoices and credit memos. The amount owed to the supplier is the balance, also known as accounts or trade payable. \n The sales ledger tracks credit customer, or debtor, accounts. This record is frequently referred to as accounts or trade receivable. The balance of this account is the amount due from credit customers. These kinds of transactions are recorded as assets. Sales ledgers are frequently used to determine how much is owed by customers at month-end or to create sales reports. \n Ledgers typically serve as a permanent record for all financial transactions of an entity. They are often used for the generation of financial statements each reporting period. These records can also be useful for researching past issues. Having accurate ledgers is not only best for the well-being of the entity, but also a legal necessity. \n Computer ledgers come in different formats, depending on the needs of the entity.

What Was the First Permanent Settlement in the U.S.? | eHowWhat Was the First Permanent Settlement in the U.S.? | eHow \n What Was the First Permanent Settlement in the U.S.? \n Although Spain, France and England all competed to establish colonial settlements in the New World, Spain claimed success in making and keeping the first permanent settlement in what is now St. Augustine, Florida in The United States of America. \n St. Augustine, Florida \n St. Augustine was founded by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés of Spain on Sept. 8, 1565. A wooden fort and encampment was built near what was referred to as Nombre de Dios, then named St. Augustine in tribute to the saint's feast day, Aug. 28, when Menéndez first sighted Florida from the sea. Also arriving on the site were 500 soldiers, 200 sailors, four parish priests and 100 civilian settlers. St. Augustine remained under Spanish rule for 235 years. This settlement also claims to have established the first school, library, church and hospital in the U.S. Although St. Augustine is known to be the first permanent settlement in what is now the United States, other European nations were also trying to establish a foothold in the New World. Jamestown, Virginia claims recognition of being the first permanent English settlement in 1607, and Plymouth, Massachusetts was settled in 1620.  Colonial Settlement - American Memory Timeline- Classroom ...Colonial Settlement - American Memory Timeline- Classroom Presentation | Teacher Resources - Library of Congress \n Louisiana: European Explorations and the Louisiana Purchase \n When the London Company sent out its first expedition to begin colonizing Virginia on December 20, 1606, it was by no means the first European attempt to exploit North America. In 1564, for example, French Protestants (Huguenots) built a colony near what is now Jacksonville, Florida. This intrusion did not go unnoticed by the Spanish, who had previously claimed the region. The next year, the Spanish established a military post at St. Augustine; Spanish troops soon wiped out the French interlopers residing but 40 miles away. \n Meanwhile, Basque, English, and French fishing fleets became regular visitors to the coasts from Newfoundland to Cape Cod. Some of these fishing fleets even set up semi-permanent camps on the coasts to dry their catches and to trade with local Indians, exchanging furs for manufactured goods. For the next two decades, Europeans' presence in North America was limited to these semi-permanent incursions. Then in the 1580s, the English tried to plant a permanent colony on Roanoke Island (on the outer banks of present-day North Carolina), but their effort was short-lived. \n In the early 1600s, in rapid succession, the English began a colony (Jamestown) in Chesapeake Bay in 1607, the French built Quebec in 1608, and the Dutch began their interest in the region that became present-day New York. Within another generation, the Plymouth Company (1620), the Massachusetts Bay Company (1629), the Company of New France (1627), and the Dutch West India Company (1621) began to send thousands of colonists, including families, to North America. Successful colonization was not inevitable. Rather, interest in North America was a halting, yet global, contest among European powers to exploit these lands. \n There is another very important point to keep in mind:  European colonization and settlement of North America (and other areas of the so-called \"new world\") was an invasion of territory controlled and settled for centuries by Native Americans. To be sure, Indian control and settlement of that land looked different to European, as compared to Indian, eyes. Nonetheless, Indian groups perceived the Europeans' arrival as an encroachment and they pursued", "parametric_answer": "jamestown virginia", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

In fact,  Wulff didn’t obtain the 623 votes needed to win after the first two rounds. \n A simple majority sufficed in the third round in order to secure a victory against the opposition rival Joachim Gauck, a former East German human rights activist. Gauck was sustained by the SPD (Social Democratic Party of Germany) and the Bündnis 90/Die Grünen  (Alliance '90/The Greens). The other two candidates were Luc Jochimsen, a   sociologist, television journalist and politician of Die Linke (Left party), and Frank Rennicke (born 1964), a neo-Nazi singer-songwriter nominated by the NPD, the National Democratic Party of Germany. \n Although at the end the majority was able to elect its represented official, the presidential election has showed many weakness inside the governing coalition and some doubts about the capacity of this government to bring to an end its mandate. \n Christian Wilhelm Walter Wulff (born 19 June 1959) is a lawyer and he has served as Prime Minister of the state of Lower Saxony since 2003.

He was President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development from 1998 to 2000 and head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from 2000 to 2004. \n Because the office of President is less influential than that of the Chancellor and is mostly concerned with ceremonial matters, Köhler was a highly popular politician during his tenure.

Note the large feet.- US Fish and Wildlife (public domain) \n Snowshoe Hare in winter white- NPS (public domain) \n Snowshoe Hares live in Connecticut. They have brown fur on top with white underbellies in the summer.  They molt to a coat of white fur in the winter.  This gives them one of their common names, the Varying Hare.  Their hind feet are very large, much larger than those of cottontail rabbits, and have furry soles.  They have small tails. Their ears have black tips, even in winter.  They weigh 2 to 3 lbs. \n Snowshoe Hares range through the very northernmost regions of the US.  They range farther south in the Sierra, Rocky and Appalachian mountains.  They range through almost all of Canada and Alaska.  In Connecticut they are present in the northern regions of the state.  Their habitat is forest.  They are active year-round and are usually most active at dawn and dusk. \n Typical diet in the wild consists of a variety of herbaceous plants during the warm season.  In the winter they eat buds twigs and bark. Hares, like rabbits, eat, then retreat to cover.  There they will produce soft green droppings that they eat again in order to extract all the nutrients from the plant matter.  Firm, dark brown oval pellets are the final result. \n Snowshoe Hares mate from early spring through the warm months and produce 2 or 3 litters a year. Snowshoe Hare babies, unlike those of rabbits are born fully-furred, with open eyes and are able to walk and hop very quickly.  Snowshoe hares nest in areas where they have packed down vegetation or grasses.  The hare babies hide in separate areas.  The family gathers daily when the babies come to the mother to nurse for a few minutes. \n Snowshoe Hares are one of the smallest of the hares and are solitary.

{"question": "\"The song \"\"I Could Be So Good For You\"\" was from which British TV series?\"", "answers": ["minder"], "context": "Minder (TV series)Minder was a British comedy-drama about the London criminal underworld. Initially produced by Verity Lambert, it was made by Euston Films, a subsidiary of Thames Television (later, Central Independent Television in 1993 and 1994) and shown on ITV. The original show ran for ten series between 29 October 1979 and 10 March 1994, and starred Dennis Waterman as Terry McCann, an honest and likable bodyguard (minder in London slang) and George Cole as Arthur Daley, a socially ambitious, but highly unscrupulous importer-exporter, wholesaler, used-car salesman and purveyor of anything else from which there was money to be made, whether inside the law or not. \n The series was principally set in inner West London (Shepherd's Bush/Ladbroke Grove/Fulham/Acton), and was largely responsible for putting the word minder, meaning personal bodyguard, into the UK popular lexicon. The characters often drank at the local members-only Winchester Club, where owner and barman Dave (Glynn Edwards) acted, often unwillingly, as a message machine for Arthur, and turned a blind eye to his shady deals. The series was notable for using a range of leading British actors, as well as many up-and-coming performers before they hit the big time; at its peak was one of ITV's biggest ratings winners. \n In 2008, it was announced that Minder would go into production for broadcast in 2009 (on Channel 5) for a new version, though none of the original cast would appear in the new episodes. The new show focused on Arthur's nephew Archie (created solely for this new version), played by Shane Richie. The series began broadcast on 4 February 2009. In 2010, it was announced that no further episodes would be made following lukewarm reception to the first series.   \n Background \n Minder was devised by writer Leon Griffiths as a vehicle for Dennis Waterman after his success in The Sweeney. George Cole's wheeler-dealer character is almost secondary, with Arthur assigning Terry a new \"minding\" job in each episode. A number of early episodes focus on Terry in such assignments, with Arthur remaining in the background. However, as the comedy potential of Cole's dodgy-dealing character emerged, as well as the successful on-screen pairing of Waterman and Cole (which proved to be one of the series' most popular elements), the emphasis increasingly focused more on Arthur's exploits, and by a few series into the show's life, typical plots revolved more around Arthur's latest shady scams instead of some of the more \"gritty\" plots of Terry's minding jobs. \n Despite its eventual success, Minder was a slow burner, not helped by being delayed by a nine-week technicians' strike which effectively blacked out the ITV network. In the light of initially poor viewing figures, management at Thames were intent on scrapping the show but managing director Bryan Cowgill persuaded them to commission one further series and repeat the first. Both attracted much larger audiences and by series 3, the show had become a major hit, and at its peak was often cited as the jewel in ITV's Drama crown. \n Terry McCann \n Terry is a former professional boxer who has served time in prison (Wormwood Scrubs) (\"two years for GBH and three for attempted robbery\" according to a police sergeant in the first episode, \"Gunfight at the OK Laundrette\", although other episodes slightly contradict this and the overall charges are often quite vague), having served a substantial term because he would not become an informant against his co-accused. With few options, Terry is employed as Arthur's minder on vague and ungenerous terms, with it often being hinted that Arthur has manipulated him into this job, and indeed is seen to continue to manipulate Terry throughout the character's run in the series, despite his often attempting to find other means of employment and break free from Arthur's control. (The later feature-length special \"An Officer and a Car Salesman\", which leads into Series 7, Terry's last stint in the series, begins with Terry once again", "parametric_answer": "gavin stacey", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

It never quite gets there, but it comes very, very close. \n Randy Tippy \n Super Reviewer \n Jacob's Ladder is one of the best psychological horror films that I have seen. Supported by a great cast, Jacob's Ladder is a creepy film. A man suffers from hallucinations after returning from the Vietnam war. The film is haunting and powerful and is a different type of horror film that blends elements of the supernatural. Jacob's Ladder is a superbly crafted film that is one intense ride through one mans conscience. Superbly acted by Tim Robbins, Jacob's Ladder successfully makes the audience uncomfortable as we see the main character, Jacob Singer go through these eerie hallucinations. Jacob's Ladder is an accomplished film with a powerful story and a strong cast. The film is not your typical horror as it is a psychological  horror film. The films delivers the chills it promises and the story is well developed with well defined characters.  Overall this is solid filmmaking Adrian Lyne has crafted the psychological horror film to see. This film is far better than any other genre film that came after it and it delivers a creepy vibe that you won't easily forget. Jacob's Ladder is the film that defined the term psychological horror, and it does it by delivering something an audience has never seen before. Jacob's Ladder is a film not to miss. This is one of Tim Robbin's best performances along with The Shawshank Redemption. Jacob's Ladder redefined and reinvented the horror genre, and by watching it, you'll understand why. \n Alex roy \n Super Reviewer \n ½ \n A Vietnam War veteran (Tim Robbins) starts seeing demonic faces and hallucinating, while at the same time some of his old army buddies are turning up dead.  He becomes paranoid that the Washington brass are hiding a secret revolving around the day he was wounded as his squad was slaughtered in the field.  Psychological drama is worthwhile due to some intense hallucination sequences, but the film would have benefitted from more misdirection in the early reels to make the big revelation feel like a climax instead of an anticlimax. \n Greg S", "parametric_answer": "medical device", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

No one took more wickets for Australia in those 27 matches - but no one played in them all, either: next comes Mitchell Johnson, with 96 wickets at 20.71 in 17 of the matches Harris played, then Nathan Lyon with 75 at 32.36 in 20, and Peter Siddle 55 at 32.00 in 19. Of the nine Australians who took seven or more wickets in the matches in which Harris played, only Johnson has a better average. If you look at all Australia's 56 matches since Harris made his Test debut in New Zealand in March 2010, only that same trio have taken more wickets than him, all from more appearances: Johnson 148 in 65 matches, Lyon 146 in 41, and Siddle 132 in 39. Next comes Ben Hilfenhaus with 65. \n With all the talk about Australia's \"Dad's Army\", what's the highest average age of any Test team? asked Peter Harrison from England \n The oldest Test team of all was England's touring team in the West Indies in 1929-30, which for a start included two 50-year-olds (Wilfred Rhodes and George Gunn) as well as a couple more aged more than 40. The average age in the final Test, in Kingston, was 37 years 188 days; England's teams in all four Tests of that series occupy the top four spots in this particular list. Next comes England's team for the final Ashes Test in 1920-21, in Sydney - the average there was 36 years 306 days. Australia's oldest team was 35 years 341 days, for the Ashes Test of 1926 at Lord's. The youngest average age for any Test team was 20 years 298 days, by Zimbabwe against Bangladesh in Dhaka in 2004-05. \n Which overseas player has captained the most Tests in England? Was it Allan Border? asked DF Tsang from China \n That's a good guess, as Allan Border captained throughout three six-Test Ashes series in England, in 1985, 1989 and 1993, a total of 18 in charge. Another Australian, Joe Darling, comes next: he also skippered in three Ashes series - 1899, 1902 and 1905 - but they were all of five Tests, so he ended with 15 as captain in England. Next comes Clive Lloyd, who led in 14 Tests in England in 1976, 1980 (when he missed one) and 1984. Only nine Englishmen have captained in more home Tests than Border: Andrew Strauss leads the way with 31, ahead of Michael Vaughan (29), Mike Atherton (28) and Peter May (26). \n Jehan Mubarak just played a Test nearly eight years after his last one. Was this a record for Sri Lanka? asked Ajantha de Silva from Sri Lanka \n The recall of Jehan Mubarak to play against Pakistan in the third Test, in Pallekele, came seven years and 202 days after his previous Test appearance, against England at the Sinhalese Sports Club in Colombo in December 2007. In that time Sri Lanka had played 63 Tests. As it turns out, Mubarak lies second - just - by both calculations for Sri Lanka: there were 69 Tests (but only seven years 185 days) between legspinner Malinga Bandara's Test debut in May 1998, and the second of an eventual eight Tests", "parametric_answer": "nasser hussain", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

Jeffries, still regarded by some fight historians as the single greatest heavyweight in history, was a fearsome and intimidating fighter who established plenty of credentials for himself in just 21 professional prizefights. He was the very embodiment of the rugged, two-fisted hulk of brawn that people at the turn of the century wanted their champion to be. It is unfortunate that his loss to Jack Johnson , after a six-year layoff from boxing, remains the best known moment of his career, for Jeffries' accomplishments were many. He fought nine bouts against future hall of famers and made seven defenses of the championship. His fighting prowess was so great, in fact, that respected boxing historian Tracy Callis wrote that Jeffries' combination of assets makes him the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time. Even Jack Johnson, Jeffries' more famous conqueror, before his own death in 1946, stated that he felt Jeffries was the best of any era. \n Early Years \n Jeffries early in his career. \n Born to farmers in Carroll, Ohio, on April 15, 1875, Jeffries was the sixth of eight children.

The tournament was held between 6 February and 20 March 2010. \n The tournament was the 11th in the Six Nations format, after the addition of Italy in 2000. Before then, the competition was known as the Home Nations Championship and the Five Nations. The 2010 Six Nations Championship was the 116th Northern Hemisphere rugby union championship. \n The championship was contested by England , France , Ireland , Italy , Scotland and Wales . France won the tournament, achieving a final 12–10 victory over England to win the Grand Slam , their first since 2004 and ninth overall (including six in the Five Nations).

[1] Hugh Dowding received his early education at St. Ninian's Boys' Preparatory School in Moffat which his father had been instrumental in founding. [2] Hugh Dowding was of Cornish ancestry being the grandchild of Lieutenant General Charles William Tremenheere.  Dowding was educated at Winchester College in England on a scholarship before joining the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich . He later served abroad in the Royal Garrison Artillery . [3] \n Military career \n Initially he served in Gibraltar , Ceylon , Hong Kong , and India . After returning to Great Britain, Dowding attended the Army Staff College in January 1912 before being posted to the Royal Garrison Artillery on the Isle of Wight in 1913. [4] After becoming interested in aviation, Dowding gained Aviator's Certificate no. 711 on 19 December 1913 in a Vickers biplane at the Vickers School of Flying, Brooklands . [5] He then attended the Central Flying School , where he was awarded his wings .  Although added to the Reserve List of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), Dowding returned to the Isle of Wight to resume his Royal Garrison Artillery duties.  However, this arrangement was short-lived and in August 1914, he joined the RFC as a pilot on No. 7 Squadron . [4] \n First World War \n Dowding was sent to France and in 1915 was promoted to commander of No. 16 Squadron . [4] After the Battle of the Somme , Dowding clashed with General Hugh Trenchard , the commander of the RFC, over the need to rest pilots exhausted by non-stop duty. As a result Dowding was sent back to Britain and, although promoted to the rank of Brigadier-General , saw no more operational service during the First World War . \n Inter-war years \n Dowding then joined the recently created Royal Air Force and gained experience in departments of training, supply, development, and research. On 19 August 1924, Air Commodore Dowding was made Chief Staff Officer for RAF Iraq Command . [4] In 1929, he was promoted to Air Vice Marshal and the following year joined the Air Council. [4] Tragedy struck in the inter-war period when Clarice, his wife of two years, died after a short illness. Left alone to bring up his son, Derek, Hugh Dowding withdrew from socialising and threw himself into his work. In 1933 Dowding was promoted to Air Marshal and was knighted. [4] \n In the years prior to the Second World War , Dowding was the commanding officer of RAF Fighter Command , and was perhaps the one important person in Britain, and perhaps the world, who did not agree with British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin 's 1932 declaration that \" The bomber will always get through \". [6] He conceived and oversaw the development of the \"Dowding System\". [7] This comprised an integrated air defence system which included (i) radar (whose potential Dowding was among the first to appreciate), (ii) human observers (including the Royal Observer Corps ), who filled crucial gaps in what radar was capable of detecting at the time (the early radar systems, for example, did not provide good information on the altitude of incoming German aircraft), (iii) raid plotting, and (iv) radio control of aircraft. The whole network was tied together, in many cases, by dedicated phone links buried sufficiently deep to provide protection against bombing. The network had its apex (and Dowding his own headquarters) at RAF Bentley Priory , a converted country house on the outskirts of London.

Originally Manneken Pis was perched on a 6ft column which was built on request by Daniel Raessens, in 1619. \n Location : The little boy statue relieving himself into a fountain can be a bit of a struggle finding in the back streets of Brussels. Mannekin Pis can be easily overlooked as it is deceptively small, considering how popular and revelled he is. It has the same affect as when you first glimpse the Little Mermaid in Denmark's harbor and realise it isn't that big!  \n Corner of Rue de l'Etuve and Rue Chenet, Brussels, Belgium. \n The Numerous Legends of Mannekin Pis : Mannekin Pis is believed to have been erected in honor of a little boy who saved Brussels. How he actually came to save the city is open to debate, but there are countless stories to amuse the curious. Here are just a few ... \n Duke Godfrey III of Leuven : Duke Godfrey III of Leuven was merely two years of age when in 1142 he became count of Leuven (or Louvain), landgrave of Brabant, margrave  of Antwerp, and duke of Lower Lorraine. It wasn't surprising that other lords saw it as a great opportunity to overthrow the infant Duke and seize the land. In 1142 the troops of  Berthouts, lords of Grimbergen, tried their luck but were thwarted in their attempt. The Duke's troops placed the infant in a basket hanging from a tree and it was from there the young boy urinated on the enemy. Years later when the Duke was 19 he had further revenge on the Berthouts by burning down their impressive motte at Grimbergen. \n Julianske : In this tale  a young boy by the name Julianske had spied foreign enemies placing explosives around the city of walls of Brussels so he urinated on the burning wicks, saving the city from certain destruction. \n The Wealthy Merchant: A popular tale told to many a tourist, was that centuries ago the little boy of a wealthy merchant went missing in the city. His distraught father organised a search party to look high and low for him and they found him happily peeing in a garden. For his gratitude the merchant had the statue and fountain erected as a gift to the locals for helping find his precious son. \n Lost Child : A variation of the Wealthy Merchant story where a woman loses her child in the city and calls upon the townsfolk to help find him (including the mayor). The child is eventually found peeing in the corner of a small street. The story was passed down over the years and eventually a statue erected. \n The King's Castle : A young boy awoke to the smell of smoke. After locating the fire he urinated on the flames saving the king's castle from burning to the ground. \n History of the Mannekin Pis statue: The Manneken Pis statue you see today isn't the original. The original was made of stone and erected in 1388 but was destroyed some time later. However,  the City of Brussels commissioned  Franco-Flemish Baroque sculptor Jerome Duquesnoy to build another one in bronze. And so he did in around 1618. But don't be fooled though, this statue is really a fake too. The Duquesnoy statue resides at Maison du Roi (King's House) and has since 1965. \n How Many Times Has Mannekin Pis Been Stolen? : Okay from all accounts Manneken Pis has been stolen a total of 7 times. The first known time was in 1695 when Marechal de Villeroy attacked Brussels. It was later found on the steps of a brothel. French soldiers stole it in 1747.

The position of Prime Minister was not created; it evolved slowly and erratically over three hundred years due to numerous acts of Parliament, political developments, and accidents of history.

{"question": "Which pigment is named after an Italian city?", "answers": ["burnt sienna", "sienna"], "context": "Shades Of Italy: Top Ten Italian Colours | ITALY MagazineShades Of Italy: Top Ten  Italian Colours | ITALY Magazine \n Shades Of Italy: Top Ten  Italian Colours \n Carol King | Tuesday, October 8, 2013 - 13:00 \n There may not be 50 shades of Italian colours but there are more than you might think. Carol King reports on some of the colours that have a very special Italian hue. \n Celeste - Italian Sky Blue \n Italian sky blue refers to a pale turquoise blue colour that is associated with the Italian bicycle company Bianchi. It is also sometimes called celeste Bianchi or Bianchi green, and is one of the celeste (sky blue) colours that attempt to emulate the colour of a clear sky. Bianchi bicycles are traditionally painted Italian sky blue. Edoardo Bianchi founded the bicycle company in Milan in 1885 and some say the colour emerged because it is meant to reproduce the colour of the Milan sky. However, others have suggested that Edoardo chose the colour to match the eyes of a former queen of Italy for whom made a bicycle. However, it seems most likely Edoardo created the colour using surplus military paint from World War I that he mixed with white to tone down its militaristic connotation. \n   \n Rosa Schiaparelli - Schiaparelli Pink \n Schiaparelli pink is a shocking pink colour more akin to magenta than pink. It is named after the Italian fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli. She introduced the colour in 1936, using it for the packaging of her perfume Shocking which was contained in a bottle sculpted by Leonor Fini in the shape of a woman's torso inspired by Mae West's tailor's dummy and Dalí paintings of flower-sellers. The packaging, also designed by Fini, was in shocking pink, which became Schiaparelli's signature colour. This in turn was inspired by the Tête de Belier (Ram's Head), a 17.27ct pink diamond from Cartier owned by heiress Daisy Fellowes, who was one of Schiaparelli's best clients. \n   \n Verde Veronese - Paolo Veronese Green \n Paolo Veronese green is an intense dark shade of green. It is named after the 16th-century Venetian painter Paolo Veronese. You can see Paolo Veronese green in the artist’s painting ‘Lucretia’ of  1583 that depicts the mythical figure of Roman history whose rape by the Etruscan king’s son and her subsequent suicide are said to have lead to the foundation of the Roman Republic. The painting hangs in Vienna’s Kunsthistorisches Museum and shows Lucretia wearing a striking green skirt. However, according to experts, the painter did not invent the colour named after him. It existed in the 14th century and came about via a painting technique employed by Veronese and other Venetian painters of that time.  \n   \n Terra di Siena - Sienna \n Sienna takes its name from terra di Siena, or earth of Siena. The yellow-brown colour refers to a pigment named after the Tuscan city where it was used by artists during the Renaissance. When heated the pigment becomes a reddish brown and is referred to as burnt sienna. The pigment was one of the first ever to be used by humans, and appears in cave paintings and Ancient Roman frescoes. It became popular during the Renaissance when the clay soil of Tuscany, which is rich in sienna’s main ingredient limonite, was used to produce the pigment. Then, the pigment was referred to as terra di Siena, terra rossa (red earth) or terra gialla (yellow earth). Italian art historian Giorgio Vasari called it terra rossa in his pioneering work of 1550 ‘The Lives of the Most Excellent Italian Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, from Cimabue to Our Times’. The brown pigment was in common use in the 16th century by artists including Caravaggio and Rembrandt. In contemporary times, the sienna pigment is produced largely in Sardinia, Sicily, the French Ardennes and the Appalachian Mountains in North America. \n   \n Giallo Napoli - Naples Yellow \n Naples yellow is sometimes known as antimony yellow. The words are used to describe a range of yellow from an earthy, reddish yellow to a bright light yellow. It refers to the chemical compound, lead (II) antimonite that was used as a", "parametric_answer": "urobilin", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

Test matches differ from One Day Internationals in that the former consist of two innings per team, and innings are not restricted in terms of overs. Test cricket is a subset of first-class cricket, so statistics and records set in Test matches also count toward first-class records. The duration of Tests, currently limited to five days, has varied through Test history, ranging from three days to timeless matches. The first recognised Test match was played between England and Australia in March 1877; since then there have been nearly 2,000 Tests played by 11 teams. The frequency of Tests has steadily increased partly because of the rise in the number of Test-playing countries, as well as cricket boards' looking to maximise revenue. \n Cricket is, by its nature, capable of generating large numbers of records and statistics. This list details the most significant team and individual records in Test cricket. \n The most successful team in Test cricket, in terms of both wins and win percentage, is Australia, having won 332 of their 712 Tests (46.62). Barring the ICC World XI, a rest of world team which played a single Test against Australia in 2005, the least successful team are Bangladesh who have struggled since their introduction to Test cricket in 2000, leading some to question their Test status. \n Australian Donald Bradman , widely considered the greatest batsman of all time, holds several personal and partnership records. He scored the most runs in a series, has the most double centuries and was a part of the record fifth and sixth wicket partnerships. His most significant record is his batting average of 99.94, considered one of cricket's most famous statistics,it stands nearly 40 runs higher than any other batsman's average. \n In 1956, England spin bowler Jim Laker took 19 wickets for 90 runs (19-90) which set not only the Test record for best match figures but also the first-class one. Laker's second innings analysis of 10-53 was the first occasion of a bowler taking all ten wickets in a Test match innings and they remain the best innings figures. Indian Leg-spinner Anil Kumble is the only other bowler to have taken 10 wickets in an innings, claiming 10-74 against Pakistan in 1999. West Indies batsman Brian Lara is the holder of the highest individual score in Test cricket, he scored 400 not out against England in 2004 to surpass the innings of 380 by Matthew Hayden six months earlier. Lara had held the record before Hayden, with a score of 375 against England 10 years earlier. \n The trend of countries to increase the number in Test matches they play means that the aggregate lists are dominated by modern players with many record holders still playing. Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan became the highest Test wicket-taker in December 2007, when he passed Shane Warne 's total of 708 wickets. Within a year, the equivalent batting record of highest run-scorer had also changed hands: Sachin Tendulkar surpassed the tally of 11,953 runs by Brian Lara.

The bridge has been built over a very famous river, the Thames. The bridge has been named of his 2 towers from 65 metres high. You have a wonderful view over the city from these towers. You can find the bridge in the heart of London. \n 1.2 History \n In the second half of the nineteenth century, the increase of economic activities in East London makes it necessary to build a new bridge. The Tower Bridge, also named London Bridge, was not enough to ensure the growing traffic at this time. In 1882, a study shows that the bridge, then off 16.5 metres, received daily 22 242 vehicles and 11 525 pedestrians. Then they decided to expand the bridge but that the river traffic is still possible. So, the Tower Bridge is completed in 1894 after 8 years of construction. The bridge is designed by Sir Horace Jones that the city architect is and engineered by Sir John Wolfe Barry. This Victorian Bridge is now more then 100 years old. \n 1.3 More information about the bridge \n The bridge is used for the traffic and pedestrians. The bridge is 60 metre long and 43 metre high. From the top of the towers you have a beautiful view of the centre of London. The bridge is made to be used 50 times a day, but these days it has only been 4to 5 times a week. The bascules are lift when a ship wants to underneath the tower bridge. A ship takes about 5 minutes to pass. The bascules raised up around 1000 times a year. Every party of the bascule bridge weight more than 1000 ton. Inside the towers you can observe the original mechanism used to raise the bridge. \n 1.3.1 What the people thought \n The people don't understand why the bridge was constructed, because it was so different from others bridges. But they thought that it a good idea was, because in London there is very full traffic and with this bridge you can easy go out and in the capital. \n 1.3.2 John Wolfe Barry \n The architect, John Wolfe Barry is born on 7 December 1836 and died on 22 January 1919.

This     and other injustices led the colonies to declare independence on July 4,     1776. Independence was achieved in 1783, when the Treaty of Paris was     signed with Britain. \n War of 1812 (1812–1815) British interference with American trade,     impressment of American seamen, and “war hawks” in Congress calling for     western expansion into British territory led to war. At the war's     conclusion, trade issues remained unresolved, but Britain gave up some of     its territorial claims on the continent. \n Mexican War (1846–1848) The U.S. annexation of Texas, and its stated desire     to acquire California and other Mexican territory, precipitated this war.     Mexico was forced to give up two-fifths of its territory. This land     eventually became the states of California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico,     and Utah. \n Civil War (1861–1865) Economic and political rivalry between an agrarian     South and an industrial North grew into a civil war fought over slavery     and states' rights. Eleven states seceded from the Union to form the     Confederate States of America. The Union victory led to the reunification     of the country and ended slavery. \n Indian Wars (colonial era to 1890) U.S. expansionism led to numerous military conflicts     with the indigenous inhabitants of North America, forcing them to give up     their land. The massacre at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1890 is generally     considered the last of these conflicts. \n Spanish American War (1898) The U.S. supported Cuba's desire for independence     from Spanish rule, and seized the opportunity to expand U.S. powers in     other parts of the world. At the end of the brief conflict, Cuba gained     its independence, and the U.S. gained several former Spanish territories:     Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. \n World War I (1914–1918) Rivalries over power, territory, and wealth led to     the “Great War.” In 1917, the U.S. joined the Allies (Britain, France,     Russia, Italy, and Japan), who were at war with the Central Powers     (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey), after German submarines     began sinking unarmed ships. \n World War II (1939–1945) The Axis powers—Germany, Italy, and Japan—attempted     to dominate the world. The Allies (U.S., Britain, France, USSR, and     others) fought to stop them. The United States entered the war in 1941,     after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor. Germany surrendered in 1945, and     Japan surrendered later that same year, after the U.S. dropped the atomic     bomb on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. \n Korean War (1950–1953) Communist North Korea, supported by China, invaded     non-communist South Korea. UN forces, principally made up of U.S. troops,     fought successfully to protect South Korea. The Korean War was the first     armed conflict in the global struggle between democracy and communism,     called the cold war. \n Bay of Pigs (1961) The U.S. orchestrated the invasion, an unsuccessful     attempt by Cuban exiles to overthrow Fidel Castro's communist regime in     Cuba. \n Vietnam War (1961–1973) In 1955, communist North Vietnam invaded     non-communist South Vietnam in an attempt to unify the country and impose     communist rule. The United States joined the war on the side of South     Vietnam in 1961, but withdrew combat troops in 1973.

The cayenne chile is a bright red chile that ranges from 2-5 inches long and about 1/2 inch in diameter.  Cayenne chiles are generally sold dried and used in soups and sauces. The majority of cayenne chiles are used to make cayenne pepper.  Used both in cooking and medicine, it owes its hot flavor to a chemical called capsaicin, which comprises about 12% of the chile.  The word cayenne seems to come from kian, the name of a pepper among the Tupi Indians in what is now French Guiana and was named after either the Cayenne River or the capital of the country, Cayenne. \n Season:  Cayenne Pepper Hot Sauces - The Original Hot Sauce ...Cayenne Pepper Hot Sauces \n Navigation: Home > Cayenne Pepper Sauces \n The Cayenne is a red, hot chili pepper used to flavor dishes, and for medicinal purposes. Named for the city of Cayenne in French Guiana, it is a cultivar of Capsicum annuum related to bell peppers, jalapeï¿½os, and others. The capsicum genus is in the nightshade family (Solanaceae). The fruits are generally dried and ground, or pulped and baked into cakes, which are then ground and sifted to make the powder, Cayenne pepper. Cayenne is used in cooking spicy hot dishes, as a powder or in its whole form (such as in Szechuan cuisine) or in a thin, vinegar-based sauce. It is generally rated at 30,000 to 50,000 Scoville Units. It is also used as a herbal supplement, and was mentioned by Nicholas Culpeper in his Complete Herbal. Excerpt from Wilkipedia, the free encyclopedia. \n Sort By:  Cayenne Pepper - The Epicentre SpicesCayenne Pepper \n Cayenne Pepper \n Cayenne Pepper \n What is Cayenne Pepper? \n Cayenne pepper takes its name from its supposed centre of origin – the Cayenne region of French Guiana, Cayenne deriving from a Tupi Indian name. It is now grown largely in India, East Africa, Mexico and the United States, in fact most tropical and sub-tropical regions. Chiles originated in South America, where they have been under cultivation since prehistoric times. The seed’s long viability facilitated the rapid spread of the plant throughout the tropics and sub-tropics by the Spanish and Portuguese, the spice becoming as popular there as vine pepper. Chiles were long known as ‘Indian’ pepper – meaning ‘of the New World’ rather than ‘of India’. Despite its specific name, and the supposed use of special chiles for it, there is little to distinguish cayenne from ordinary pure chilli powder, except that commercial ‘chilli powder’ usually contains other spices such as garlic or cumin , and is rougher in texture. \n Cayenne pepper is a finely ground powder prepared from the seeds and pods of various types of chile. The cayenne variety is commonly called ‘Bird Chile’, and the botanical name variously given as C. minimum or C. baccatum. As most powders are blends, the names of the varieties used are not very important. The capsicums used are the small-fruited varieties: thinnish tapered seed pods up to 12cm (5in) long and 2.5cm (1″) in diameter. Cayenne is made from the ripened fruit, varying from red to yellow. The powder is red or red-brown in colour. Some cayennes include the ground seeds and are hotter than those which exclude them. Cayenne pepper is well known and easily available in the West. It should not be confused with the vine peppers which yield common black pepper. \n Bouquet: Dusty but slightly aromatic. \n Flavour: Hot, pungent and biting, although not as powerful as the hotter chillies. \n Hotness Scale: 8-9 \n Preparation and Storage \n Cayenne should not be used to the same degree as paprika , which it resembles, for it is much stronger. When used as a condiment it should be sprinkled sparingly. It should be kept in a dark container as it is affected by sunlight, and bought in small quantities as it deteriorates rapidly, losing its pungency.", "parametric_answer": "mexico", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

Eventually, a pool of players were participating in regular tournaments.  In 1925, with a growing interest in the sport, he established the MacRobertson Shield, an international tournament of croquet \"Tests\" between Australia and England.

In 1930, New Zealand was invited to participate in a series between themselves and Australia, with Australia winning comfortably and the first triangular series was held in 1935 in Melbourne as part of the Melbourne centenary celebrations.  In 1993, a United States team was admitted into the tournament. \n Between 1974 and 2010 the team representing the Croquet Association was named Great Britain and in two series Great Britain and Ireland, because the teams included players from Scotland, Wales and Ireland.

Kennedy was the youngest president of the United States, this is in error. He was the youngest president ever elected to the presidency at the age of 43. However, Theodore Roosevelt was the youngest man to serve as president when he took over after William McKinley's assassination . He was 42.  \n The founders of the Constitution decided that the age requirement to become a member of the House of Representatives should be 25, to become a Senator should be 30, and to become the president to be 35. One reason why this was the case was to make sure that individuals had the time to gain real world experience before leading the nation. In addition, there were no term limits set on the presidency until the passage of the 22nd amendment in 1947. Older presidents would not be able to stay in office quite as long, avoiding the appearance of a monarchical president. Finally, there was a belief that by the age of 35 individuals would have created a reputation for themselves on the national stage so that voters and electors would know ore about who they were electing as president. \n continue reading below our video \n What are the Seven Wonders of the World \n   \n Some question whether this age limit could be considered age discrimination. However, this issue is moot in that individuals who are even 40 years of age are often cited as being too young when they run for president. When President Obama ran for the presidency in 2008, he was 46 years old. Articles such as one written by one of John McCain's justice advisory committee members, Steven Calabresi, argued that he was still too young to serve as president. This despite the fact that he was 11 years old than he minimum required by the Constitution. However, in a poll taken during 2008, 13% of those polled stated that they thought he was too young to be president. The point of this is that in the United States, there is a perception that age is important in terms of gaining experience and reputation when being considered for the presidency.  \n Here are the ages of the ten youngest presidents to have served in the United States since its founding:  List of Presidents of the United States by ageThis is a list of United States Presidents by age.

{"question": "What language did the playwright Henrik Ibsen write his plays in?", "answers": ["danish"], "context": "Henrik Ibsen | Norwegian Ibsen Company – Kåre ConradiHenrik Ibsen | Norwegian Ibsen Company – Kåre Conradi \n Press \n Henrik Ibsen \n Henrik Ibsen (Norwegian pronunciation: [ˈhɛnɾɪk ˈɪpsən]; 20 March 1828 – 23 May 1906) was a major 19th-century Norwegian playwright, theatre director, and poet. He is often referred to as “the father of prose drama” and is one of the founders of Modernism in the theatre. His major works include Brand, Peer Gynt, An Enemy of the People, Emperor and Galilean, A Doll’s House, Hedda Gabler, Ghosts, The Wild Duck, Rosmersholm, and The Master Builder. \n Several of his plays were considered scandalous to many of his era, when European theatre was required to model strict mores of family life and propriety. Ibsen’s work examined the realities that lay behind many façades, revealing much that was disquieting to many contemporaries. It utilized a critical eye and free inquiry into the conditions of life and issues of morality. The poetic and cinematic play Peer Gynt, however, has strong surreal elements. \n Ibsen is often ranked as one of the truly great playwrights in the European tradition. Richard Hornby describes him as “a profound poetic dramatist—the best since Shakespeare“. He influenced other playwrights and novelists such as George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, James Joyce, and Eugene O’Neill. Many critics consider him the greatest playwright since Shakespeare. \n Ibsen wrote his plays in Dano-Norwegian (the common written language of Denmark and Norway) and they were published by the Danish publisher Gyldendal. Although most of his plays are set in Norway—often in places reminiscent of Skien, the port town where he grew up—Ibsen lived for 27 years in Italy and Germany, and rarely visited Norway during his most productive years. Born into a merchant family connected to the patriciate of Skien, his dramas were shaped by his family background. He was the father of Prime Minister Sigurd Ibsen. \n Family and Youth \n Ibsen was born to Knud Ibsen (1797–1877) and Marichen Altenburg (1799–1869), a well-to-do merchant family, in the small port town of Skien in Telemark county, a city which was noted for shipping timber. As he wrote in an 1882 letter to critic and scholar Georg Brandes, “my parents were members on both sides of the most respected families in Skien”, explaining that he was closely related with “just about all the patrician families who then dominated the place and its surroundings”, mentioning the families Paus, Plesner, von der Lippe, Cappelen and Blom. Ibsen’s grandfather, ship’s captain Henrich Ibsen (1765–1797), had died at sea in 1797, and Knud Ibsen was raised on the estate of ship-owner Ole Paus (1776–1855), after his mother Johanne, née Plesner (1770–1847), remarried. Knud Ibsen’s half brothers included lawyer and politician Christian Cornelius Paus, banker and ship-owner Christopher Blom Paus, and lawyer Henrik Johan Paus, who grew up with Ibsen’s mother in the Altenburg home and after whom Henrik (Johan) Ibsen was named. \n Knud Ibsen’s paternal ancestors were ship’s captains of Danish origin, but he decided to become a merchant, having initial success. His marriage to Marichen Altenburg, a daughter of ship-owner Johan Andreas Altenburg (1763–1824) and Hedevig Christine Paus (1763–1848), was “an excellent family arrangement. Marichen’s mother and Knud’s step-father were sister and brother, and the bride and groom, who had grown up together, were practically regarded as sister and brother themselves. Marichen Altenburg was a fine catch, the daughter of one of the wealthiest merchants in the prosperous lumber town of Skien.” Theodore Jorgenson points out that “Henrik’s ancestry [thus] reached back into the important Telemark", "parametric_answer": "norwegian", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

There are 44 landlocked countries that do not have direct access to an ocean or ocean-accessible sea (such as the Mediterranean Sea).  \n Why Is Being Landlocked an Issue? \n While a country such as Switzerland has thrived despite its lack of access to the world's oceans, being landlocked has many disadvantages. Some landlocked countries rank among the poorest in the world. Some of the issues of being landlocked include: \n Lack of access to fishing and oceanic food sources \n High transportation and transit costs because of a lack of access to ports and world shipping operations \n Geopolitical vulnerabilities from dependence on neighboring countries for access to world markets and natural resources \n Military limitations because of the lack of naval options \n What Continents Have No Landlocked-Countries? \n North America has no landlocked countries, and Australia is rather obviously not landlocked. \n continue reading below our video \n What are the Seven Wonders of the World \n Within the United States, over half of the 50 states are landlocked with no direct access to the world's oceans.

{"question": "\"Which British composer wrote \"\"The Dam Busters March\"\"?\"", "answers": ["eric coates"], "context": "The Dam Busters, march for the film score - Eric Coates ...The Dam Busters, march for the… | Details | AllMusic \n google+ \n Description                             by Michael Jameson \n The music of Eric Coates (1886-1957) is most frequently associated with images of World War II, and the allies' struggle against the threat of Nazi domination. Coates , himself a one-time orchestral viola player turned composer, would have been flattered to know that one work in particular, The Dambusters March, has become universally synonomous with one of the most fabled and audacious acts of daring for which wartime Britain has been credited. \n Coates wrote this popular piece for the 1954 British movie about the infamous bombing raid carried out by 617 Squadron of the Royal Air Force, which destroyed three great dams in the Ruhr, crippling much of Germany's industrial power base. The film recounts the preparations for the raid in detail, and introduces Dr. Barnes Wallis, inventor of the so-called Bouncing Bomb. \n The remaining incidental music for the movie was written by Leighton Lucas , and not by Coates himself. Remarkably, though, Coates ' stirring Dam Busters March (main title music for the film) is perhaps even more widely known than the film itself, which is occasionaly screened on TV. \n The march exists in versions for full orchestra and for military band. An expectant opening, suggestive of distant aircraft approaching, leads to a lively first theme, which (interestingly) is never actually heard on the movie soundtrack. It is the martial, patriotic second idea, a slower-moving melody of noble proportions, that is used to such gripping emotional effect on screen. After its first statement, there follows a return of the jaunty first subject, but a long crescendo-allargando brings a reprise of the main march itself, culminating with a powerful coda. \n Appears On  Dam Busters 1955 film – Dambusters BlogDam Busters 1955 film – Dambusters Blog \n charlesfoster 2 Comments \n Somehow I missed this BBC4 documentary the first time it was aired in 2013, but I’m happy to say that I caught up with it on Monday evening. The journalist Simon Heffer, who has a longstanding interest in the British war films genre, wrote and presented a fascinating programme which looked at the plethora of 1950s films about the war. \n What made it even more interesting were the interviews with the people who were involved with these films. These included the actors Donald Sinden, Virginia McKenna and Sylvia Syms, and Guy Hamilton, who directed The Colditz Story. For me, of course, the star of the show was Michael Anderson, the director of The Dam Busters. \n Interviewed in his home in Canada and looking very spry, Anderson described the first time he had heard Eric Coates play the Dam Busters March and knew instantly that this was the music for the film. He also praised R C Sherriff’s script, a ‘masterpiece of understatement’, something that he was keen to preserve in his direction. And he confessed that he was still moved by the final scene, where Gibson tells Barnes Wallis, distraught at the loss of 56 men, that even if all the men had known that they wouldn’t be coming back, ‘they’d have gone for it just the same. I knew them all and I know that’s true.’ Wallis isn’t really consoled, but he accepts what Gibson says, and suggests that the CO should get some sleep. This Gibson cannot yet do, and he delivers the film’s final line of dialogue: ‘I have to write some letters first.’ Without another word, Wallis stumbles out of shot and Gibson marches towards his office, exchanging salutes with a passing sergeant. As John Ramsden remarks in his BFI monograph: ‘It is as fine a moment as actor, screenwriter or director ever managed in a film, and coming at the very end, its result is devastating.’ (John Ramsden, The Dam Busters, Tauris 2003, p.95.) \n Anderson has had a long and distinguished career in the cinema.

{"question": "Which English road in Anglo-Saxon times went from Axminster via Bath, Cirencester, Leicester and Newark to Lincoln?", "answers": ["fosse way"], "context": "CirencesterCirencester (, occasionally; see below for more variations)  is a market town in east Gloucestershire, England, 93 miles (150 km) west northwest of London. Cirencester lies on the River Churn, a tributary of the River Thames, and is the largest town in the Cotswold District. It is the home of the Royal Agricultural University, the oldest agricultural college in the English-speaking world founded in 1840. The town's Corinium Museum is well known for its extensive Roman collection. The Roman name for the town was Corinium, which is thought to have been associated with the ancient British tribe of the Dobunni, having the same root word as the River Churn.  The earliest known reference to the town was by Ptolemy in 150AD. \n Cirencester is twinned with Itzehoe, Germany.  \n Local geography \n Cirencester lies on the lower dip slopes of the Cotswold Hills, an outcrop of oolitic limestone. Natural drainage is into the River Churn, which flows roughly north to south through the eastern side of the town and joins the Thames near Cricklade a little to the south. The Thames itself rises just a few miles west of Cirencester. \n The town is split into five main areas: the town centre, the suburbs of Chesterton, Stratton (originally villages outside the town), Watermoor and The Beeches. The village of Siddington to the south of the town is now almost contiguous with Watermoor. Other suburbs include Bowling Green and New Mills.The area and population of these 5 electoral wards are identical to that quoted above. \n The town serves as a centre for surrounding villages, providing employment, amenities, shops, commerce and education, and as a commuter town for larger centres such as Cheltenham, Swindon and Stroud. \n Transport \n Cirencester is the hub of a significant road network with important routes to Gloucester (A417), Cheltenham (A435), Warwick (A429), Oxford (A40 via the B4425 road), Wantage (A417), Swindon (A419), Chippenham (A429), Bristol, Bath (A433), and Stroud (A419).  However, only Gloucester, Cheltenham, Stroud and Swindon have slow bus connections. These good roads bring the town passing trade. Although the ring road and bypass take traffic away from the town centre, both roads have busy service areas with adequate parking. \n Since closure of the Kemble to Cirencester branch line to  in 1964 the town has become one of the largest in the region without its own rail station. However Kemble railway station, 4 miles away, serves as a railhead. It provides regular services between  and , with peak-time direct trains to London Paddington station. \n The nearest airports are Bristol Airport, Cotswold Airport at Kemble, London (Heathrow) and Birmingham. \n History \n Roman Corinium \n Cirencester was known to be an important early Roman area, along with St. Albans and Colchester, and the town includes evidence of significant area roadworks. When the Romans built a fort where the Fosse Way crossed the Churn, to hold two quingenary alae tasked with helping to defend the provincial frontier c. AD 49, native Dobunni were drawn from Bagendon, a settlement of the Dobunni situated 3 miles (5 km) to the north, to create a civil settlement near the fort. When the frontier moved to the north following the conquest of Wales, this fort was closed and its fortifications levelled c. 70, but the town persisted and flourished under the name Corinium Dobunnorum. \n Even in Roman times, there was a thriving wool trade and industry, which contributed to the growth of Corinium. A large forum and basilica was built over the site of the fort, and archaeological evidence shows signs of further civic growth. There are many Roman remains in the surrounding area, including several Roman villas near the villages of Chedworth and Withington. When a wall was erected around the Roman city in the late second century, it enclosed 240 acres (1 km²), making Corinium the second-largest city by area in Britain. The details of the provinces of Britain following the Diocletian Reforms around 296 remain unclear but Corinium is now usually thought to", "parametric_answer": "icknield way", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

But the gift of genius too often seems to come paired with struggle, as exceptionally talented people often wrestle with mental illness, social missteps, and conflicts within themselves and their families as they are exploited or pushed to develop their abilities further than they’re comfortable with doing. We’ll explore 10 movies that delve into these struggles and shed light on what it’s like to live as a tortured genius. \n Good Will Hunting \n This endearing movie launched the careers of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, winning the pair an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Matt Damon, playing the title role, is a young janitor who is a hidden genius in a sea of intellect. While working at MIT, his genius is discovered as he handily, but secretly, solves difficult graduate-level algebraic problems posted on the chalkboard, but is then discovered in the act by a professor. After landing into legal trouble, Hunting is forced to explore his genius, and although he initially preferred to live out his life as a laborer, he was inspired to embrace his ability, while also inspiring the professor and therapist who worked with him. As Hunting struggles with his identity as a genius, he discovers a major fault within himself: he’s just too smart for relationships, overthinking them into oblivion, until the day he comes to terms with his life and past abuses to embrace both himself and the pre-med student who loves him. This story tells a tale of how genius can work against those who have it, and offers a caution against being too smart to live out your own life. \n A Beautiful Mind \n Most people would say that they’d love to be insanely smart, but A Beautiful Mind delivers the frustrating story of a tortured genius. In this biopic about John Nash, viewers see the very real mental health struggles some very gifted people go through. This movie follows Nash’s story as he discovers a very interesting mathematical theorem, and even works for the U.S. Department of Defense to stop a Soviet plot, but suffers as his involvement in the Soviet project makes him become increasingly paranoid and obsessive. It is discovered that although Nash is a genius and capable of working out problems that some can only do with the help of computers, he suffers from schizophrenia and has been hallucinating, creating an imaginary world of friends for years. His mental troubles cause problems in his marriage, but eventually, Nash is able to outsmart and control his hallucinations using his considerable genius, and goes on to win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for his work on game theory. A Beautiful Mind shows just how difficult life can be for those who are extremely gifted. \n The Royal Tenenbaums \n Most movies about genius share the struggles and triumphs of a single gifted individual, but this movie goes beyond the singular, exploring what an entire family of eccentric child prodigies might be like. And not just as children, but in their adult lives as their fame and genius have faded after their father leaves the family. The family members, who have been living separate lives, all come together when the parents are challenged with divorce and an imagined terminal illness. What follows is a highly emotional and absurd look into their love affairs and secrets. This movie explores what it’s like to be extremely gifted and talented, only to let it slip away, but does point out how very possible it is to get right back to it with the right motivation and the support of a great family. \n Finding Forrester \n Those who are struck with genius sometimes find themselves afflicted with reclusiveness, too full of a fear of participating in a world that reminds them of past hardships and leaves them open to new ones. But in Finding Forrester, we see the power that mentorship can have on both the mentee and the mentor.

The topics are immortality, paradise, and the “food of the Gods.” Full analysis and more details are available in the book. \n Enki receives sacrifice and proffers the Plant of Immortality as living waters flow from his throne \n In the Greek myths, the gods of Olympus live on “ambrosia,” which is brought to them by doves. Whatever this substance is, it is what gives them immortality, and because of that, they don’t need to eat normal food. It is said specifically that, because of the ambrosia, the gods have no blood in them, and therefore they cannot die. “Their thirst, thence bloodless and from death exempt,” as Homer said it in The Illiad. Instead of blood, their bodies contain a golden substance called “Ichor,” which is toxic to humans. \n Remember, the angels in The Third Book of Enoch complained to God that he had given his secret name to someone of flesh and blood. But in the stories of vampires, it is drinking blood that gives them eternal life. This is because it is believed to contain the essential human life force, which, being without a soul, vampires lack. Therefore they need to get it through dietary supplements. \n The inhabitants of the Grail king are eternally youthful, except for their gray hair. This is because they are fed by the food of the Grail. In Eschenbach’s version, a dove brings a communion wafer from Heaven, and the Grail somehow transmutes it into food that brings immortality. In most of the Grail stories, there is a mysterious banquet at the Grail castle, called the “Grail service,” in which people eat from the Grail. Events that occur at the meal imply that they are eating human flesh and drinking human blood. \n Plutarch describes a strange sacrificial rite in which the “servants of Saturn” are sent out on perilous voyages to this island, where they serve him for a period of thirteen years. After that time, they have the choice of staying in his realm or returning home. He writes: \n “But when the star of Saturn, which we call the ‘Informer,’ but they ‘Nocturnal,’ comes into the sign of the Bull every thirty years, they having got ready a long while beforehand all things required for the sacrifice and the games … they send out people appointed by lot in the same number of ships, furnished with provisions and stores necessary for persons intending to cross so vast a sea by dint of rowing, as well as to live a long time in a foreign land. … it is, indeed, allowed to such as have served thirteen years in waiting upon the god, to return home, but the greatest part prefer to remain there, partly out of habit, partly because they have all things in abundance without toil and trouble, as they pass their time in sacrifices and hymn singing, or in studying legends and philosophy of some sort. For wonderful are both the island and the mildness of the climate; whilst the deity himself has been an obstacle to some when contemplating departure, by manifesting himself to them as to familiars and friends, not by way of dreams or by tokens, but conversing with them in a visible form with many apparitions and speeches of genii … The stranger having been carried there, as he told us, and waiting upon the god at his leisure, he gained acquaintance with astrology and geometry as far as it is possible to advance, whilst he took up ‘natural science’ for his department of philosophy.” \n … \n An interpretation of the broken column given by several Masonic scholars is that it has something to do with the myth of Isis and her brother/husband Osiris.

In 1933, Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany and announced he wanted to build new roads and affordable cars for the German people. At that time, Austrian-born engineer Ferdinand Porsche (1875-1951) was already working on creating a small car for the masses. Hitler and Porsche later met and the engineer was charged with designing the inexpensive, mass-produced Volkswagen, or “people’s car.” Hitler’s plan was that people could buy the cars by making regular payments into a savings stamp program. In 1938, work began on the Volkswagen factory, located in present-day Wolfsburg, Germany; however, full-scale vehicle production didn’t begin until after World War II. \n In the 1950s, the Volkswagen arrived in the U.S., where the initial reception was tepid, due in part to the car’s historic Nazi connection as well as its small size and unusual rounded shape (which later led to it being dubbed the “Beetle”). In 1959, the advertising agency Doyle Dane Bernbach launched a groundbreaking campaign that promoted the car’s diminutive size as a distinct advantage to consumers, and over the next several years, VW became the top-selling auto import in the U.S. In 1998, Volkswagen began selling the highly touted “New Beetle” while still continuing production of its predecessor. After more than 60 years and over 21 million vehicles produced, the last original Beetle rolled off the line in Puebla, Mexico, on July 30, 2003. \n The world’s original best-selling car, Henry Ford’s Model T, first went into production at a Detroit, Michigan, plant in 1908. Referred to as the car that “put the world on wheels,” the Model T revolutionized the automotive industry–and American society in general–by providing affordable, reliable transportation for the average person. In 1913, Ford Motor Company began employing the moving assembly line at its plant in Highland Park, Michigan, which reduced the assembly speed of a chassis from 12 hours and eight minutes to one hour and 33 minutes. The following year, Ford produced 308,162 vehicles, more than the output of all other carmakers combined. By 1924, the 10 millionth Model T came off the assembly line. When production finally ended, after 19 years, in May 1927, over 15 million Model Ts had been built. \n Related Videos  VolkswagenVolkswagen AG (VW;) () is a German car manufacturer headquartered in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, Germany.

{"question": "What U.S. state borders four Great Lakes?", "answers": ["michigan", "state of michigan"], "context": "The State of Michigan - An Introduction to the Great Lakes ...The State of Michigan - An Introduction to the Great Lakes State from NETSTATE.COM \n The State of Michigan \n Michigan Capitol, Lansing \n Welcome to Michigan, the Great Lake state. Michigan is quite unique among the states in that it is divided into two distint geographic sections, the Upper peninsula, and the Lower peninsula. Lake Michigan lies between the two peninsulas. The Upper peninsula is very sparsely populated, more than 90% of the peninsula being forested. The Lower peninsula contains the cities, industry, and agriculture. The Upper and Lower Peninsulas were connected in 1957 with the construction of Big Mac, the Mackinac Bridge. \n Almost half of Michigan is comprised of water and, except for Alaska, Michigan has more shoreline than any other state, fronting four of the Great Lakes: Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, and Lake Erie. With 3,177 miles of Great Lakes shoreline it is easy to see why Michigan boasts a thriving recreational industry, and leads the nation with approximately one million registered pleasure boats. \n \"Michigan, handsome as a well made woman, and dressed and jewelled. It seemed to me that the earth was generous and outgoing here in the heartland, and, perhaps, its people to a cue from it.\" \n Author John Steinbeck \n THE STATE NAME: \n The word Michigan originally referred to a clearing on the lower peninsula and was derived from the Chippewa Indian word \"majigan\" which means clearing. Lake Michigan was named after this clearing by European explorers in the area in the 1670's. The state later took the name of the clearing as well. \n Cherry Orchard, Leelanau County \n The Wolverine State \n It has been generally accepted that Michigan was nicknamed \"The Wolverine State\" for the abundance of wolverines that once roamed the peninsula. However, according to the Michigan Historical Center, wolverines were very rare in Michigan if they were present at all. It's not clear how this nickname originated, but there are two theories. \n Some think the nickname was originated by Ohioans in 1835 during a dispute over an Ohio/Michigan boundary called the \"Toledo Strip.\" This dispute became known as the Toledo War . Though Michigan and Ohio both sent troops to the area, no shots were ever fired. It's said that Ohioans, at that time, referred to Michiganians as \"...as vicious and bloodthirsty as wolverines.\" \n Another theory is proposed that Native Americans compared the way that settlers were taking land, in the 1830s, to the way the excessively greedy wolverine went after its food. \n Avalon Beach, Monroe \n The Great Lake State \n or \"The Great Lakes State\", or \"The Lakes State\" nicknames have been applied to Michigan for many years. They refer to the fact that Michigan shores meet four of the five Great Lakes and to the number of inland lakes in the state. The four Great Lakes that border Michigan are Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron and Lake Erie. There are also more than 11,000 inland lakes in Michigan and, according to the Michigan Historical Center, one is never more than six miles from an inland lake or more than 85 miles from one of the Great Lakes. \n From 1968 to 1975 and from 1979 to 1983, the legend on the standard Michigan License Plate read \"The Great Lake State.\" This legend recognizes the Great Lakes and more than 11,000 inland lakes found in the state. This legend was changed to \"Great Lakes\" in 1984. \n Water Wonderland \n This promotional nickname again references the water resources of the state of Michigan. \"Water Wonderland\" appeared on Michigan license plates beginning in 1954. It was modified to \"Water-Winter Wonderland\" in 1965. This modified legend appeared on Michigan license plates from 1965 through 1967. \n Lady of the Lake \n With over 40,000 square miles of water surface within its boundaries, Michigan's history has been \"saturated\" with the association. \"Lady of the Lake\" is another nickname referencing the influence of water in the state.

It comes in a variety of styles with the most common being virgin, extra virgin and pure olive oil. It is a highly versatile oil that is made from pressing the oil from olives. Olive oil comes mostly from the Mediterranean basin, where large crops of olive trees are grown for the purpose of producing god quality olive oil. \n The Highest producer of Olive Oil \n Despite the popular belief that Italy is the largest producer of olive oil, Spain actually produces more than Italy does. Spain is therefore the country which produces the most olive oil. Spain produces approximately 40% of the world olive oil. Italy is Spain’s largest buyer of olive oil, buying 60% of the oil they make. This is then blended with Italian olive oil and sold under an Italian label. Many people are now seeking to buy Spanish olive oil and it is developing a good market of its own. Spain has a good climate for growing olives as it has warm summers and mild winters. \n Five Fun Facts about Olive Oil \n Tuscany-styled olive oil is the most sought for its green color and pungent smell \n Olive oil loses flavor as it ages so you are best not to keep it too long \n Olive oil is technically a fruit juice rather than oil. The olives are pressed to release their juices just like an orange or a lemon be pressed. \n In Ancient Greece, women applied olive oil to their skin and hair after bathing as protection from the elements and to maintain a pleasant fragrance \n Christopher Columbus introduced olive oil to the Americas in 1492.

According to an estimate there are 700 different locally grown cultivars in Italy. Italians have the ability to blend oil from other places and convert them into bigger brands of high quality and price. This particular skill makes Italy the biggest importer and exporter.

{"question": "Eugne Arnold Dolmetsch (1858-1940) is seen as largely responsible for promoting what for use in schools?", "answers": ["recorder"], "context": "Arnold DolmetschEugène Arnold Dolmetsch (24 February 1858 – 28 February 1940), was a French-born musician and instrument maker who spent much of his working life in England and established an instrument-making workshop in Haslemere, Surrey. He was a leading figure in the 20th-century revival of interest in early music. \n Early life \n The Dolmetsch family was originally of Bohemian origin, but (Eugène) Arnold Dolmetsch, the son of Rudolph Arnold Dolmetsch and his wife Marie Zélie (née Guillouard) was born at Le Mans, France, where the family had established a piano-making business. It was in the family's workshops that Dolmetsch acquired the skills of instrument-making that would later be put to use in his early music workshops. \n He studied music at the Brussels Conservatoire and learnt the violin with Henri Vieuxtemps. In 1883 he travelled to London to attend the Royal College of Music, where he studied under Henry Holmes and Frederick Bridge, being awarded a Bachelor of Music degree in 1889. \n The early music revival \n Dolmetsch was employed for a short time as a music teacher at Dulwich College, but his interest in early instruments was awakened by seeing the collections of historic instruments in the British Museum, and, after constructing his first reproduction of a lute in 1893, he began building keyboard instruments. William Morris encouraged him to build his first harpsichord. He left England to build clavichords and harpsichords for Chickering of Boston (1905–1911), then for Gaveau of Paris (1911–1914). \n He went on to establish an instrument-making workshop in Haslemere, Surrey, and proceeded to build copies of almost every kind of instrument dating from the 15th to 18th centuries, including viols, lutes, recorders and a range of keyboard instruments. His 1915 book The Interpretation of the Music of the XVIIth and XVIIIth Centuries was a milestone in the development of 'authentic performances' of early music. \n In 1925 he founded an annual chamber music festival, the International Dolmetsch Early Music Festival, which is held every July at Haslemere in the Haslemere Hall. \n Dolmetsch was active in the cultural life of London, and his friends and admirers included William Morris, Selwyn Image, Roger Fry, Gabriele D'Annunzio, George Bernard Shaw, Ezra Pound, George Moore, whose novel Evelyn Innes celebrates Dolmetsch's life and work, and W. B. Yeats. \n He was responsible for rediscovering the school of English composers for viol consort (including John Jenkins and William Lawes), leading to Sir Henry Hadow's tribute that Dolmetsch had \"opened the door to a forgotten treasure-house of beauty\". He was also largely responsible for the revival of the recorder, both as a serious concert instrument, and as an instrument which made early music accessible to amateur performers. He went on to promote the recorder as an instrument for teaching music in schools. \n In 1937 he received a British Civil list pension and in 1938 he was created a chevalier of the Légion d'honneur by the French government. \n Dolmetsch family \n Arnold Dolmetsch was married three times. On 28 May 1878 he married Marie Morel of Namur, Belgium (a widow, ten years his senior) but was divorced in 1898. His second wife, to whom he was married on 11 September 1899, in Zürich, was Elodie Désirée, the divorced wife of his brother. This marriage ended in divorce in 1903. Thirdly, he was married on 23 September 1903 to Mabel Johnston, one of his pupils. \n Dolmetsch encouraged the members of his family to learn the skills of instrument-making and musicianship and the family frequently appeared together in concerts, playing instruments constructed in the Dolmetsch workshops. Following the death of Arnold Dolmetsch at Haslemere in 1940, his family continued to promote the building and playing of early instruments. \n * Mabel Dolmetsch, his wife, was a noted player of the bass viol. \n * Rudolph Dolmetsch, his son, was a gifted keyboard player, who died during World War II. \n * Nathalie Dolmetsch, his daughter, was a viol player and leading member of the Viola da Gamba Society. \n * Carl Frederick Dolmetsch, his son, was a noted recorder player", "parametric_answer": "music", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

Trump told reporters that, at Gingrich's request, he was starting a program for disadvantaged New York schoolchildren, modeled on his competitive reality TV show \"The Apprentice.\" \"We're going to be picking ten young, wonderful children, and we're going to make them apprenti,\" Trump said. That's right, he said apprenti. \n He next said, \"We're going to have a little fun with it,\" so perhaps Trump was simply having some fun with the pluralization of apprentice. In fact, he very well may have been harking back to another playful use of apprenti, from the fourth season of \"The Apprentice\" back in 2005. The final two contestants in that season were Randal Pinkett and Rebecca Jarvis. In the finale (video here ), Trump picked Pinkett as the winner with his trademark line, \"You're hired.\" But in a surprise twist, he asked Pinkett if Jarvis should also be hired by the Trump organization. Put on the spot, Pinkett responded, \"There is one and only one apprentice, and if you're going to hire someone tonight, it should be one. It's not 'The Apprenti,' it's 'The Apprentice.'\" He pronounced apprenti as Trump later would, as \"uh-PREN-tie.\" (You could also interpret Pinkett as saying that it's not \"The Appren-tie\" — in other words, there's no tie at the end between two winners.) \n I'll give both Pinkett and Trump the benefit of the doubt and assume that they weren't seriously suggesting that the plural of apprentice is apprenti instead of apprentices. Or maybe they were only half-serious. In any case, there's a long tradition of jocular faux-Latin plural forms, as Neal Whitman discussed earlier this year in \" Phoni Latin Plurals .\" Neal mentions such examples as Elvi(i) as a plural for Elvis, stewardi(i) as a plural for stewardess, and Winklevi(i) as a plural of Winklevoss (referring to the Winklevoss twins depicted in the movie \"The Social Network\"). \n In most of these cases, -i (or -ii) gets used as a pseudo-plural suffix for words with an unstressed [əs] ending, mimicking the pluralization of second-declension masculine Latin nouns like alumnus/alumni, stimulus/stimuli, or radius/radii. When borrowed into English, (real) Latin plurals tend to have their -i ending pronounced as \"eye\" rather than \"ee\": alumn-eye, stimul-eye, radi-eye. (The \"ee\" pronunciation would be more loyal to Latin, but the \"long i\" pronunciation has become entrenched in English for Latin-derived words with i at the end of a syllable.) And so it goes with bogus plurals like apprent-eye. \n It's not just humorous plurals that get the fake-Latin treatment, however. Words that are etymologically Greek, such as octopus and platypus, very often take -i plurals in English, such as octopi and platypi, where Greek word formation would dictate octopodes and platypodes. Nobody goes around saying octopodes and platypodes in English, of course, and since octopi and platypi misapply Latin morphology to Greek words, you're better off simply pluralizing them as octopuses and platypuses. But those \"sound wrong\" to many people, as Ben H. Winters discovered when deciding between octopi and octopuses for his book Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters (see this column for a description of his struggle). \n When dealing with classically derived words, English speakers often prefer pluralizing -us words with -i instead of -uses, except for words that are frequently used, such as circuses, campuses, and viruses. (But see Neal's column for recent attempts to pluralize virus as viri(i), even though that plural does", "parametric_answer": "winklevosses", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

In his all-too-brief career, Lee became a film star in Asia, and a pop-culture icon, posthumously, in America. \n Lee was born while his father, a Chinese opera star, was on tour in America. The Lee family moved back to Hong Kong in 1941. Growing up, Lee was a child actor who appeared in some 20 Chinese films; he also studied dancing and trained in the Wing Chun style of gung fu (also known as kung fu). In 1959, Lee returned to America, where he eventually attended the University of Washington and opened a martial-arts school in Seattle. In 1964, he married Linda Emery, who in 1965 gave birth to Brandon Lee, the first of the couple’s two children. In 1966, the Lees relocated to Los Angeles and Bruce appeared on the television program The Green Hornet (1966-1967), playing the Hornet’s acrobatic sidekick, Kato. Lee also appeared in karate tournaments around the United States and continued to teach martial arts to private clients, including the actor Steve McQueen. \n In search of better acting roles than Hollywood was offering, Lee returned to Hong Kong in the early 1970s. He successfully established himself as a star in Asia with the action movies The Big Boss (1971) and The Way of the Dragon (1972), which he wrote, directed and starred in. Lee’s next film, Enter the Dragon, was released in the United States by Hollywood studio Warner Brothers in August 1973. Tragically, Lee had died one month earlier, on July 20, in Hong Kong, after suffering a brain edema believed to be caused by an adverse reaction to a pain medication. Enter the Dragon was a box-office hit, eventually grossing more than $200 million, and Lee posthumously became a movie icon in America. \n Lee’s body was returned to Seattle, where he was buried. His sudden death at the young age of 32 led to rumors and speculation about the cause of his demise. One theory held that Lee had been murdered by Chinese gangsters, while another rumor circulated that the actor had been the victim of a curse. The family-curse theory resurfaced when Lee’s 28-year-old son Brandon, who had followed in his father’s footsteps to become an actor, died in an accidental shooting on the set of the movie The Crow on March 31, 1993.

With no standardised method of analysing traffic, various nations around the world claim to boast the largest port in the world. \n This top ten list of global ports has been made in consideration of size, gross tonnage handled and the role that these ports play in the import and export capabilities of the nations they serve and in international imports and exports.  \n 10. Port of Felixstowe, United Kingdom \n Though small in comparison to ports around the globe and covering a mere 1.4 square miles, the Port of Felixstowe on the Suffolk coast accounts for almost half of Britain’s container trade. According to the Journal of Commerce , this North Sea port processes more than 3.4 million TEU’s (Twenty-foot Equivalent Units) every year and connects the UK to more than 360 other global ports. \n 9. Port of Hamburg, Germany \n Germany’s ‘Gateway to the World’ is the nation’s largest port and the third largest in Europe, behind Rotterdam and Antwerp. \n In 2012, the gross tonnage of cargo processed by the port increased by 4.4 percent and reached 130.9 million tons, as documented by the Port of Hamburg Authority . \n 8. Port Hedland, Western Australia \n The naturally deep anchorage of this harbour has led to Port Hedland becoming one of the highest tonnage ports in all of Oceania. \n In 2011, the port handled in excess of 199 million tons of cargo, more than any port in the history of Australia. Exports for Port Hedland include iron ore, of which the port is one of the largest handlers in the world. \n 7. Port of Jebel Ali, United Arabs Emirates \n Located in the city of Dubai, the Port of Jebel Ali is the largest man-made harbour in the world and the Middle East’s biggest port. \n With links to the Dubai International Airport Cargo Village, this port is the epicentre for international imports and exports in the Middle East, and boasts a transit time between ship and plane of just four fours, a time period unrivalled by any other port. \n 6. Port of South Louisiana, United States \n As you might expect, the largest port in the United States falls along the mammoth expanse of the great Mississippi River. \n As well as occupying a top spot in the world largest shipping ports and the largest in America, the Port of South Louisiana is also one of the biggest bulk cargo ports in the world. As recorded in the First Quarter 2013 Tonnage Report , the Port of South Louisiana accounts for up 70 percent of the nation’s grain exports, including wheat, soy and corn. \n 5. Port of Hong Kong, China \n Like many of the world’s largest and busiest ports, Hong Kong in the South China Sea is a natural harbour and accounts for the cities strong presence in the world market. \n The Port of Hong Kong is dominated by container traffic and for a proportion of the late 20th Century, was one world’s busiest container ports serving South-East Asia.  \n 4.

But why is it so? \n Credit : Martineric \n Most of the non marathon runners I ask the question answer that this weird number must be due to the conversion from imperial units to the metric system (or the other way round). \n It is not. The distance in miles is 26 miles and 385 yards, commonly rounded to 26.2. So why was this distance chosen? \n Let’s get back to the origins of the marathon race. \n The origin of the marathon \n In the year 490 B.C., Miltiade a Greek general from Athens inflicted a serious defeat on the Persians in the plains of Marathon, a small village in the northwest of Athens. In order the convey the news of the victory, a Greek soldier, Phidippides, ran at a stretch from the battlefield to Athens. After delivering the news, he collapsed and died. \n What distance did he actually run? We certainly don’t know the exact distance, because we don’t know the route he followed. \n I made a little test. I went to the Google maps web site and asked for the direction from Marathon to Athens.With the modern road system, the distance is 42.3 km. Isn’t that amazing? But most historians assume that the distance ran by Phidippides was around 40 km. \n Modern marathon \n As legendary and fictitious as this story seems, it lead to the creation of the modern marathon race. When Pierre de Coubertin gave birth to the modern Olympic games, the first marathon was set to 40 kilometers. But during the early Olympic games, the distance of the marathon varied a lot. It went from 40 km to 42.75. \n City \n 42.195 \n 26.22 \n The definitive distance for the marathon race was determined in 1921 by the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF). The distance chosen was the one ran in London in 1908 : 26 miles 385 yards or 42.195 km. \n The london race in 1908 \n It is commonly said that the distance was set to 26 miles 385 yards because of the Royal family.  During the preparation of the summer Olympiads, it had been agreed that the organizers would include a marathon of about 40 km or 25 miles. The British officials, desirous to accommodate the King of England, started the race at Windsor Castle and finished at the Royal box in the Olympic Stadium—a distance of precisely 26 miles 385 yards. \n But that only explains why the London marathon’s distance was 42. 195 km. It doesn’t tell us why this distance was chosen as the definitive marathon distance. \n A dramatic event \n The London race became famous because of the so called ‘London affair’. \n Dorando Pietri, an Italian runner, leading the race was staggering badly when he entered the Olympic Stadium. He collapsed several times on the track. The crowd in the stadium thought he was going to die. A compassionate official, finally helped the semiconscious runner across the finish line. After the event, the story was on the media for days. Some even reported Pietri had died in the hospital after the race. This sensational finish helped the marathon fix itself in the imagination of the crowds as THE endurance race, even though it was dangerous to run. This helped spread the word about marathon running more than anything else. \n Unfortunately, because of the help he had received, the Italian runner was disqualified and Johnnie Hayes was declared winner. \n The IAAF never officially explained why they had chosen 26 miles and 385 yards as the official distance for the marathon in 1921. But I’m a strong believer that it is due to the enormous emotion generated by the London race. \n Latest Interviews  MarathonThe marathon is a long-distance running event with an official distance of 42.195 kilometres (26.219 miles, or 26 miles 385 yards), usually run as a road race.

The addition of the two Century stations gives GMG the largest regional footprint. \n The deal reunites GMG chief executive John Myers with the Salford-based Century radio station, which he launched before joining the group. \n Mr Myers, who was a presenter under the name John Morgan, said: \"These are two very good stations, with great people and in areas of the UK we know well. It gives us increased scale and consolidates our determination to be a major force in radio. \n \" Smooth and Century in the north west appeal to different audiences, with very different formats. They are actually very complementary.\" \n Asked if GMG Radio would be pursuing further expansion, he added: \"We never say never.\" \n Premises \n Mr Myers said GMG would push ahead with its bid to secure a new FM radio licence serving Greater Manchester. \n This latest deal will see staff from Smooth FM's Exchange Quay base relocated alongside their new Century 105.4 FM colleagues at Salford Quays. \n The GCap Media stations Capital Gold and XFM Manchester will move to new premises. \n Carolyn McCall, chief executive of Guardian Media Group, said: \"These are great assets and a perfect match for our existing radio portfolio. The purchase supports our wider group strategy of expanding our radio operations through licence applications and acquisitions, together with diversifying our overall media group portfolio.\" \n GCap Media will continue to sell national airtime on the Century stations on behalf of GMG. Regional agency sales will also remain with GCap, apart from in Gateshead, home of Century 100-102 FM. \n Local Century sales teams will continue to manage their own direct airtime. GCap Media chief executive Ralph Bernard said: \"We have carefully considered the priorities for the business at this time and the objectives of our national and local radio portfolio.

{"question": "Who was the deviser, producer and director 'That Was The Week That Was'?", "answers": ["ned sherrin"], "context": "That Was the Week That WasThat Was the Week That Was, informally TWTWTW or TW3, was a satirical television comedy programme on BBC Television in 1962 and 1963. It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost. \n The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. It broke ground in comedy through lampooning the establishment and political figures. Its broadcast coincided with coverage of the politically charged Profumo affair and John Profumo, the politician at the centre of the affair, became a target for derision. TW3 was first broadcast on Saturday, 24 November 1962. \n Cast and writers \n Cast members included cartoonist Timothy Birdsall, political commentator Bernard Levin, and actors Lance Percival, who sang topical calypsos, many improvised to suggestions from the audience, Kenneth Cope, Roy Kinnear, Willie Rushton, Al Mancini, Robert Lang,  David Kernan and Millicent Martin. The last two were also singers and the programme opened with a song – That Was The Week That Was – sung by Martin to Ron Grainer's theme tune and enumerating topics in the news. Frankie Howerd also guested with stand-up comedy.  \n Script-writers included John Albery, John Antrobus, John Betjeman, John Bird, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Peter Cook, Roald Dahl, Richard Ingrams, Lyndon Irving, Gerald Kaufman, Frank Muir, David Nobbs, Denis Norden, Bill Oddie, Dennis Potter, Eric Sykes, Kenneth Tynan, and Keith Waterhouse.  \n Programme \n The programme opened with a song (\"That was the week that was, It's over, let it go ...\") sung by Millicent Martin, referring to news of the week just gone. Lance Percival sang a topical calypso each week. Satirical targets, such as Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Home Secretary Henry Brooke were lampooned in sketches, debates and monologues. Other targets were the monarchy, Britain's declining status as a global power, racism (particularly in the American South and South Africa under Apartheid), sexual and social hypocrisy, the class system, and the BBC itself. Well-remembered sketches include a 'consumers' guide to religion', which discussed relative merits of faiths in the manner of a Which? magazine report. \n On Saturday, 20 October 1962 the award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz, and to Francis Crick, James D. Watson, and Maurice Wilkins was satirised in a short sketch with the prizes referred to as the Alfred Nobel Peace Pools; in this sketch Watson was called \"Little J.D. Watson\" and \"Who'd have thought he'd ever get the Nobel Prize? Makes you think, doesn't it\". The germ of the joke was that Watson was only 25 when he helped discover DNA; much younger than the others. \n TW3 was broadcast on Saturday night and attracted an audience of 12 million. It often under- or overran as cast and crew worked through material as they saw fit. At the beginning of the second season in the autumn of 1963, in an attempt to assert control over the programme, the BBC scheduled repeats of The Third Man television series after the end of TW3. Frost suggested a means of sabotaging this tactic to Sherrin, and he agreed. For three weeks, Frost read out the plot of The Third Man, until the repeats were abandoned following the direct intervention of the BBCs Director General Hugh Greene.  \n Frost often ended a satirical attack with the remark \"But seriously, he's doing a grand job\".  At the end of each episode, Frost usually signed off with: \"That was the week, that was.\" At the end of the final programme he announced: \"That was That Was The Week That Was...that was.\" \n Kennedy tribute \n For the edition on Saturday, 23 November 1963, the day after the assassination of United States President John F.

Photo © George Burgess \n Torpedo torpedo \n This small torpedo has an oval pectoral disc with a straight edge at the very front, an elongated body with rounded pelvic fins, and two small dorsal fins set back on its stout tail near its triangular caudal (tail) fin. It is white underneath, and reddish brown on top, with five dark blue spots ringed with dark and light accents. The solitary nocturnal fish scavenges the shallow coastal sea floor for crustaceans and bony fish, using the kidney-shaped electric organs on either side of its head to stun its prey. Although it can only shock a human, because of its shallow habitat, caution should be used when possibly interacting with this torpedo. \n Order - Torpediniformes \n Geographical Distribution \n World distribution map for the common torpedo \n The common torpedo resides in the eastern Atlantic Ocean in the southern Bay of Biscay and throughout the Mediterranean to Angola. \n Habitat \n This demersal species prefers soft bottoms including sandy flats and seagrass beds, typically in inshore locations although it is occasionally observed in deeper waters. It is most commonly observed in tropical waters to 1,312 feet (400 m) in depth within its geographical range. \n Biology \n Common torpedo: dorsal and ventral views. Photo © George Burgess \n Distinctive Features \n The disc of the common torpedo is circular in shape with a nearly straight front edge. The eyes and spiracles are small with the lateral and posterior rims of the spiracles possessing low knobs which tend to decrease in size as the individual ages. Behind the spiracles, on the nape is a pair of mucous pores and on either side of the head are two large, kidney-shaped electric organs that are visible just beneath the skin. A wide, quadrangular flap of skin is located between the nostrils, almost reaching the mouth. Five pairs of gill slits are located on the ventral side of the disc. The distinct pelvic fins have rounded outer margins and the short thick tail possesses skin folds along both sides with two dorsal fins located on the top, the first of which is slightly larger than the second. The caudal fin is triangular in shape with rounded corners and is roughly as long as the space between it and the first dorsal fin. The smooth skin lacks dermal denticles. \n Coloration \n The common torpedo has a disc-shaped body that is light to dark brown in color on the dorsal surface. Within this area are distinct large spots, also known as ocellae. Each spot is blue and circled by darker and lighter rings. Usually there are five ocellae in a symmetrical row of three and another row of two. Torpedos with less ocellae are uncommon and those with more than five are quite rare although not unknown. An individual was caught off of Tunisia with eight ocellae and another with nine off of southern France. The ventral surface of the body is cream-colored and the margins of the disc are dark in color. There has been at least one documented albino specimen that was captured off the coast of Tunisia. \n Dentition \n The small teeth are arranged within the jaws in a dense quincunx patter, with 22-24 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 20-22 tooth rows in the lower jaw. Each tooth has a single sharp cusp. \n Close-up of ocellae. Photo © George Burgess \n Size, Age, and Growth \n The maximum reported length of a male common torpedo is 23.6 inches (60.0 cm) total length (TL) and 16.1 inches (41.0 cm) TL for a female specimen. However, this species more commonly reaches lengths of 11.8 inches (30 cm) TL (male) and 15.6 inches (39 cm) TL (female). Common torpedos reach larger sizes in waters off of Africa in comparison to those residing in the Mediterranean Sea. \n Food Habits \n Adult common torpedos feed primarily on benthic bony fish such as soles, herring, gobies, mullet, goatfish, porgies, dragonets, and jack mackerels.

{"question": "\"In economics, whose law states that, \"\"Bad Money Drives Out Good\"\"?\"", "answers": ["thomas gresham", "sir thomas gresham"], "context": "Gresham's lawIn economics, Gresham's law is a monetary principle stating that \"bad money drives out good\". For example, if there are two forms of commodity money in circulation, which are accepted by law as having similar face value, the more valuable commodity will disappear from circulation.    \n The law was named in 1860 by Henry Dunning Macleod, after Sir Thomas Gresham (1519–1579), who was an English financier during the Tudor dynasty. However, there are numerous predecessors. The law had been stated earlier by Nicolaus Copernicus; for this reason, it is occasionally known as the Copernicus Law.   It was also stated in the 14th century, by Nicole Oresme c.1350,  in his treatise On the Origin, Nature, Law, and Alterations of Money,   and by jurist and historian Al-Maqrizi (1364–1442) in the Mamluk Empire; and noted by Aristophanes in his play The Frogs, which dates from around the end of the 5th century BC. \n Good money and bad money \n Good money is money that shows little difference between its nominal value (the face value of the coin) and its commodity value (the value of the metal of which it is made, often precious metals, nickel, or copper). \n In the absence of legal-tender laws, metal coin money will freely exchange at somewhat above bullion market value. This may be observed in bullion coins such as the Canadian Gold Maple Leaf, the South African Krugerrand, the American Gold Eagle, or even the silver Maria Theresa thaler (Austria). Coins of this type are of a known purity and are in a convenient form to handle. People prefer trading in coins rather than in anonymous hunks of precious metal, so they attribute more value to the coins of equal weight. \n The price spread between face value and commodity value is called seigniorage.  Because some coins do not circulate, remaining in the possession of coin collectors, this can increase demand for coinage. \n On the other hand, bad money is money that has a commodity value considerably lower than its face value and is in circulation along with good money, where both forms are required to be accepted at equal value as legal tender. \n In Gresham's day, bad money included any coin that had been debased. Debasement was often done by the issuing body, where less than the officially specified amount of precious metal was contained in an issue of coinage, usually by alloying it with a base metal.  The public could also debase coins, usually by clipping or scraping off small portions of the precious metal, also known as \"stemming\" (reeded edges on coins were intended to make clipping evident). Other examples of bad money include counterfeit coins made from base metal. Today all circulating coins are made from base metals, known as fiat money. \n In the case of clipped, scraped, or counterfeit coins, the commodity value was reduced by fraud, as the face value remains at the previous higher level. On the other hand, with a coinage debased by a government issuer, the commodity value of the coinage was often reduced quite openly, while the face value of the debased coins was held at the higher level by legal tender laws. \n Examples  \n Silver coins were widely circulated in Canada (until 1968) and in the United States (until 1964 for dimes and quarters and 1970 for half-dollars) when the Coinage Act of 1965 was passed. These countries debased their coins by switching to cheaper metals thereby inflating the new debased currency in relation to the supply of the former silver coins. The silver coins disappeared from circulation as citizens retained them to capture the steady current and future intrinsic value of the metal content over the newly inflated and therefore devalued coins, using the newer coins in daily transactions. In the late 1970s, the Hunt brothers attempted to corner the worldwide silver market but failed, temporarily driving the price far above its historic levels and intensifying the extraction of silver coins from circulation. \n The same process occurs today with the copper content of coins such as the pre-1997 Canadian penny, the pre-1982 United States penny and the", "parametric_answer": "greshams", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

It was written with DJ Murray the K (Murray Kaufman), who bet that Darin couldn't write a song that began with the words, \"Splish Splash, I was takin' a bath\", as suggested by Murray's mother, Jean Kaufman.  The song was credited to Darin and \"Jean Murray\" (a combination of their names) to avoid any hint of payola. The song helped to give Darin a major boost in his career, reaching No. 3 on the U.S. pop singles chart. It was recorded in a session at New York's Atlantic Studios  on the evening of April 10, 1958.  The personnel on the original recording included Jesse Powell on tenor sax,  Al Caiola, Billy Mure on guitar, Wendell Marshall on bass, and Panama Francis on drums. \n Original copies of \"Splish Splash\" (Atco 6117) feature echo in the song.  For the reissue (Atlantic Oldies Series 13055), the echo is filtered out. \n The lyrics mention several characters from other songs of the period, including \"Lollipop\", \"Peggy Sue\", and \"Good Golly Miss Molly\". \n However in an interview, former classmate Jerrold Atlas claimed that \"Miss Molly\" referred to Molly Epstein, Darin's former English teacher at the Bronx High School of Science. \"She taught him to use the language in staccato notes: short fast, words...She was very fond of Bobby. Bobby told me she sharpened his respect for language\".  \n This was Darin's first hit, and in a 1967 interview,  Darin claimed that he was so happy about having his first hit that his skin condition cleared up. \n Other versions \n British comedian Charlie Drake scored a top ten hit with a comedy version of the song in 1958, produced by future Beatles producer George Martin on the Parlophone label. The song was remade in 1979 by Barbra Streisand for her album Wet. It features new lyrics by Streisand and backing vocals from Toto lead singer Bobby Kimball and Chicago keyboardist Bill Champlin. \n The song was featured in the trailer for the Patrick Dempsey film Loverboy. The song appears in the soundtrack for the 1998 movie, You've Got Mail, and also in an episode of Happy Days where Richie Cunningham becomes a DJ, 'Richie The C' (possibly a play on Murray the K). It was also featured as a DTV music video on The Disney Channel, set mostly to clips of Disney characters bathing, particularly from the 1948 cartoon Mickey and the Seal (illustrating the singer's bath in the first verse), but also Mickey's Birthday Party (to illustrate the party he walks in on). Kevin Spacey performs the song in the Bobby Darin biopic Beyond the Sea. The song was also featured on a insert on Sesame Street where the Zoo keepers at the Bronx Zoo are washing the elephants. \n The song can also be heard in the films Because of Winn-Dixie and Air Bud. The song is also partially sung in 2012 film The Dictator, when the main character, General Aladeen (Sacha Baron Cohen) plays a practical joke on his new friend (Jason Mantzoukas) by singing the song with a severed head as a hand puppet, while his friend is taking a shower. \n In 1976, Barry Williams, Maureen McCormick, Donny Osmond and Marie Osmond performed the song on The Brady Bunch Variety Hour. \n In both the English and German versions of Animals United, Billy the Meerkat sings this song while taking a shower, but it's cut off by Toto the Chimpanzee.  1958 - onlineweb.comMike Smith's Hot Hundred UK Hits \n Title: Wake Up Little Susie \n Artist: Everly Brothers \n Writer(s): Felice and Boudleaux Bryant \n Entered chart 8 Nov 1957; Highest Position: 2; Weeks on chart: 13; at number 3 at beginning of 1958. \n These two brothers had roots in American Country Music, but soon became major Rock 'n' Roll stars.  They were Don Everly (born 1 Feb 1937)", "parametric_answer": "tommy steele", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

The game's prototype was invented in 1964 by John Spinello, a University of Illinois industrial design student at the time, who sold his rights to the game to Milton Bradley for a sum of USD $500 and the promise of a job upon graduation.  Initially produced by Milton Bradley in 1965, Operation is currently made by Hasbro, with an estimated franchise worth of USD $40 million.   \n The game is a variant on the old-fashioned electrified wire loop game popular at funfairs around the United States. It consists of an \"operating table\", lithographed with a comic likeness of a patient (nicknamed \"Cavity Sam\") with a large red lightbulb for his nose. In the surface are a number of openings, which reveal cavities filled with fictional and humorously named ailments made of plastic. The general gameplay requires players to remove these plastic ailments with a pair of tweezers without touching the edge of the cavity opening. \n Gameplay \n Operation includes two sets of cards: The Specialist cards are dealt out evenly amongst the players at the beginning of the game. \n In the U.S. version, players take turns picking Doctor cards, which offer a cash payment for removing each particular ailment, using a pair of tweezers connected with wire to the board. Successfully removing the ailment is rewarded according to the dollar amount shown on the card. However, if the tweezers touch the metal edge of the opening during the attempt (thereby closing a circuit), a buzzer sounds, Sam's nose lights up red, and the player loses the turn. The player holding the Specialist card for that piece then has a try, getting double the fee if he or she succeeds. \n Since there will be times when the player drawing a certain Doctor card also holds the matching Specialist card, that player can purposely botch the first attempt in order to attempt a second try for double value. \n The game can be difficult, due to the shapes of the plastic ailments and the fact the openings are barely larger than the pieces themselves. \n *Adam's Apple: an apple in the throat ($100). \"Adam's apple\" is a colloquial term referring to the thyroid cartilage surrounding the larynx that becomes more visually prominent during puberty. \n *Broken Heart: a heart shape with a crack through it on the right side of the chest ($100).

With the start of the First Anglo-Dutch War the Dutch squadron had to face yet another enemy, the English ships under Captain Henry Appleton and Captain Richard Badiley.  In the first months of 1653 Dutch and English squadrons have been chasing each other in a cat and mouse game in the vicinity of the island of Elba. A series of actions resulted in a capture of an English frigate Phoenix by the Dutch. The ship was placed under the command of a young officer Cornelis Tromp, the son of the glorious Dutch Admiral Maerten Tromp. \n   \n In March 1653 the Dutch have finally succeeded in trapping Captain Appleton and his 6 ships in the port of Livorno (Leghorn) in Italy. Livorno was a neutral territory under the Grand Duke of Tuscany. On one night the English undertook a successful sortie and recaptured the Phoenix. Cornelis Tromp was surprised in his sleep but managed to escape by jumping overboard. Later he was fished out of the water by a merchantman. \n   \n This action meant a violation of the port’s neutrality by the English. Van Galen issued a demand for the English ships to leave. By this point an English squadron commanded by Richard Badiley has arrived to join forces with the trapped ships. The Dutch sailed out to face the new threat on a favorable wind. The blockaded squadron attempted to use the chance to escape and left the port. The Dutch however abandoned their previous target and instead attacked the escaping ships. All but one of Appleton’s ships were either destroyed or captured and only Mary could outrun the Dutch and rejoin Badiley. The wind prevented the latter from coming to Appleton’s rescue. At the end Badiley found himself outnumbered (8 + Mary vs. 16 Dutch) and was forced to retreat. Admiral Van Galen was mortally wounded in the action and died on March 23. \n   \n Battle of Kentish Knock (slag bij de Hoofden) 8 October 1652 \n   \n The Battle was fought near the shoal called the Kentish Knock in the North Sea about thirty kilometres east of the mouth of the river Thames. The Dutch fleet, internally divided on political, regional and personal grounds, proved incapable of making a determined effort and was soon forced to withdraw, losing two ships and many casualties. \n   \n Dutch Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp had been suspended by the States-General of the Netherlands after his failure to bring the English to battle off the Shetland Islands in August, and replaced as supreme commander of the confederate Dutch fleet by the Hollandic Vice-Admiral Witte de With of the Admiralty of the Maze. This caused an immediate rift between the provinces of Holland and Zealand as De With was the personal enemy of the commander of the Zealandic fleet, Vice-Admiral Johan Evertsen, who himself had quit service because of a conflict with the States-General. Earlier tensions had been moderated by the fact that both Tromp and Evertsen were staunch Orangists, but De With was a loyal servant of the States regime that had dominated Dutch politics since the death of stadtholder William II of Orange.De With, having for months advocated a more aggressive naval policy aimed at destroying the enemy fleet instead of passively defending the merchant convoys against English attack, now saw an opportunity to concentrate his forces, joining the squadron of Vice-Commodore Michiel de Ruyter, and gain control of the seas. He set out to attack the English fleet at anchor at The Downs near Dover, departing from the Schooneveld on 5 October 1652; immediately the fleet was hit by a storm damaging many vessels.

Calling it ‘Goldie’, Lyle starts selling it from wooden casks. Before long he’s supplying a tonne a week to grocers across London and demand is such that soon the famous green and gold tin that we know today, is born.  \n 1883 \n Lyle had strong religious beliefs, which is why the tin’s famous logo depicts strongman Samson’s ‘lion and bees’ from the Bible’s Old Testament, registered as Lyle's trademark. ‘Out of the strong came forth sweetness’, as the quote goes; where bees produce honey inside the lion’s carcass, rich syrup pours from the well-loved tin… And the logo and design remain unchanged to this day (along with the delicious contents, of course). \n 1911-1912 \n The syrup tins were soon to prove just how hardy they were. Captain Scott took a supply of Golden Syrup with him on his ill-fated Antarctic expedition in 1910. And when Scott’s stores were re-discovered by explorers in 1956, the characteristic tin was still in good condition, along with the syrup inside. \n Captain Scott’s recovered Lyle’s Golden Syrup… \n and letter of thanks. \n 1914 \n It takes nothing less than a world war to briefly change the iconic packaging. With all available metal going to the front lines to help support the war effort, the Lyle's tin material is temporarily replaced with cardboard – and a packaging explanation – for the duration. \n 1922 \n Lyle's Golden Syrup is now so popular that King George V is partial to a drop. Lyle's includes a ‘Royal Warrant’ on its tin to highlight its status supplying to the monarchy.

I was reading John Thorne as well as Laurie Colwin, so I'm not sure which one introduced me but I've enjoyed keeping a tin on my shelf ever since.  But what exactly is Lyle's Golden Syrup and even more importantly, what's up with the dead lion and the honey bees on the label? \n Lyle's Golden Syrup was invented in 1885 by a Scottish businessman by the name of Abram Lyle. It is a by-product of the cane sugar manufacturing process, making it popular these days with people seeking to avoid high-fructous corn syrup.  It is golden amber in color with a rich, deep sweetness that is distinct from honey, maple syrup or corn syrup. \n Extremely popular in the British Isles, Lyle's Golden Syrup is less well-known in the States, much to our misfortune.  Lyle's has many uses: \n poured over classic breakfast dishes like pancakes, porridge, English muffins and yogurt \n drizzled over fruit salads or on fruit before grilling \n as a sweetener in baked goods like pies or poured on top of a warm cake layer for an instant glaze \n for a touch of sweetness in savory marinades or in cocktails \n Most interesting use:  mixed with red food coloring to make fake blood on movie sets! \n And what about that mysterious logo (the oldest branding in the world according to Guiness Book of Records)?  Abram Lyle was a religious man and the drawing of a dead lion surrounded by honey bees is inspired by the Bible, Judges 14:14.

In gases the movement of the particles is highly energetic and this is the reason why gases form, the particles have enough energy to overcome the attractive forces holding the particles together. In gases the particles are moving very quickly and freely in a random manner constantly bumping into each other and their surroundings. It is these collisions between the particles of the gas and the walls of the container it is confined to that creates gas pressure. The gas pressure is the overall force of all these collisions divided by the area of the walls of the container it is confined in. \n The relationship of a gas with pressure and volume was developed by the scientist Robert Boyle at around 1660 and is known as Boyle’s Law. \n Boyle’s law states: \n \"For a fixed mass of gas, at a constant temperature, the product (pressure x volume) is a constant.\" \n Pressure x Volume = constant \n The animation below gives and explanation of Boyle's law: \n   \n A sealed cylinder with no leaks contains a fixed mass of a gas kept at a constant temperature. The gas pressure is created by the collision of the moving gas particles with each other and against the walls of the cylinder. \n   \n The above set up is used to investigate the relationship between pressure and volume for a gas. A force is exerted on the piston to compress the gas. The corresponding pressure and volume values are recorded for different applied forces. \n   \n By plotting the recorded values of pressure (p) against volume (V) a curve is produced. We can see from the values that when the pressure is doubled the volume is halved. If the pressure was to increase by 3 the volume would decrease to a third. Thus, the volume is inversely proportional to the pressure. By plotting pressure (p) against the reciprocal of the volume (1/V) a straight line is obtained the gradient of which is the constant in Boyle’s Law. \n   \n A decrease in volume increases the number of gas particles per unit volume. This results in an increase in the number of gas particles close to the cylinder walls and therefore an increase in the number of collisions with the wall. As the number of collisions per unit area increases so does the force per unit area thereby giving an increase in pressure. \n   \n Boyle’s Law Example: \n Using the example of the sealed cylinder above, the volume of gas at the start is 50 cm3 with a pressure of 1.2 x 105 Pascals. The piston is pushed slowly into the syringe until the pressure on the gauge reads 2.0 x 105 Pascals. What is the volume of gas? \n Solution:  BBC Bitesize - GCSE Physics - Temperature and gas ...BBC Bitesize - GCSE Physics - Temperature and gas calculations - Revision 3 \n Solids, liquids and gases \n Temperature and gas calculations \n Temperature can be measured using the Celsius and Kelvin scales. Gas pressure increases with temperature. Equations explain the relationship between pressure, temperature and volume in gases. \n Revise \n Volume and pressure in gases – the gas laws \n Boyle’s law \n Decreasing the volume of a gas increases the pressure of the gas. An example of this is when a gas is trapped in a cylinder by a piston. If the piston is pushed in, the gas particles will have less room to move as the volume the gas occupies has been decreased. \n As the pressure applied to a piston is doubled, the volume inside a cylinder is halved \n Because the volume has decreased, the particles will collide more frequently with the walls of the container. Each time they collide with the walls they exert a force on them. More collisions mean more force, so the pressure will increase. \n When", "parametric_answer": "boyles", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}
{"question": "Alan Coren, who died in 2007, and Sandi Tostvig were rival captains on which TV game show?", "answers": ["call my bluff"], "context": "Alan CorenAlan Coren (27 June 1938 – 18 October 2007) was an English humourist, writer and satirist who was well known as a regular panellist on the BBC radio quiz The News Quiz and a team captain on BBC television's Call My Bluff. Coren was also a journalist, and for nine years was the editor of Punch magazine. \n Early life \n Alan Coren was born in Southgate, North London, in 1938, the son of a plumber and a hairdresser. This is a source of some confusion, as some appear to think he was born in Paddington.  \n Education \n Coren was educated at East Barnet Grammar School, followed by Wadham College at the University of Oxford to which he gained a scholarship, and where he got a First in English in 1960. After taking a master's degree   he studied for a doctorate in modern American literature at Yale and the University of California, Berkeley. \n Life and career \n Coren considered an academic career but decided instead to become a writer and journalist.  \n He began this career by selling articles to Punch and was later offered a full-time job there. At this time he also wrote for The New Yorker. \n Magazine Editorships  \n In 1966, he became Punchs literary editor, and went on to become deputy editor in 1969 and editor in 1978. He remained as editor until 1987 when the circulation began to decline.  \n Unsurprisingly, during the week in which he took over the editorship, the Jewish Chronicle published a profile of him. His response was to rush around the office, waving a copy of the relevant edition, saying: \"This is ridiculous – I haven't been Jewish for years!\"  \n When Coren left Punch in 1987, he became editor of The Listener, continuing in that role until 1989. \n Columns \n Known (if only to himself) as the \"Sage of Cricklewood\", where he lived, his columns always contained humour and criticism. \n From 1971 to 1978, Coren wrote a television review column for The Times. \n From 1972 to 1976 he wrote a humour column for the Daily Mail. \n He wrote for The Observer, Tatler and The Times. \n From 1984 Coren worked as a television critic for the Mail on Sunday until he moved as a humorous columnist to the Sunday Express, which he left in 1996. \n In 1989 he started a column in The Times, which he continued for the rest of his life. \n Broadcasting \n Coren began his broadcasting career in 1977. He was invited to be one of the regular panellists on BBC Radio 4's new satirical quiz show, The News Quiz. He continued on The News Quiz until the year he died. \n From 1996 to 2005 he was also one of two team captains on the UK panel game Call My Bluff. \n Scriptwriting \n In 1978 he wrote The Losers, an unsuccessful sitcom about a wrestling promoter starring Leonard Rossiter and Alfred Molina. \n Books \n Coren published about twenty books during his life, many of which were collections of his newspaper columns, such as Golfing for Cats and The Cricklewood Diet. \n From 1976 to 1983 wrote the Arthur series of children's books. \n One of his most successful books, The Collected Bulletins of Idi Amin (a collection of his Punch articles about Amin) was rejected for publication in the United States on the grounds of racial sensitivity. These Bulletins were later made into a comedy album, The Collected Broadcasts of Idi Amin with the actor John Bird. After the Tanzanian capture of Kampala in 1979 the American journalist Art Barrett discovered a copy of Coren's book on Idi Amin's bedside table. \n Coren's other books include The Dog It Was That Died (1965), The Sanity Inspector (1974), All Except The Bastard (1978), The Lady from Stalingrad Mansions (1978), Rhinestone as Big as the Ritz (1979), Tissues for Men (1981), Bumf (1984), Seems Like Old Times: a Year in the Life of Alan Coren (1989), More Like Old Times (1990), A Year in Cricklewood (1991),", "parametric_answer": "countdown", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

The celebrities were placed in a specially constructed London restaurant-kitchen with the task of catering for a clientele of famous people. Eliminations were determined by a series of public votes (in the style of Big Brother). \n Jennifer Ellison was declared the winner.

The second series featured ten members of the public competing for a prize of £250,000, with which the winner could start his or her own restaurant. They were split into two teams of six, one red (tutored by Gary Rhodes) and the other blue (led by Jean-Christophe Novelli). A new and much larger restaurant was built to accommodate the fact that there were now two kitchens. \n The only things that remained the same in the second series were the music, by composer Daniel Pemberton, and the presenter, who was still Angus Deayton.

Political turmoils resulting into large boycotts during the Cold War limited the participation in the 1980 and 1984 Olympic Games. \n The Olympics covers many rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. \n 2012 London Olympics \n The 2012 Olympics is the third summer Games to be held in the city of London. London has hosted summer Olympics twice before in 1908 and 1948 and with this year's Games the city will become the first to host the modern Games thrice. \n 1908 Olympics: The 1908 Olympic Games were scheduled to take place in Rome, but the eruption of Mount Vesuvius on 7 April 1906 prompted the shifting of the Games to London. \n 1948 Olympics: The 1948 Olympics was the first to be held after World War II, after the 1944 Games was cancelled due to the war. \n 2012 Olympics: The 2012 Olympics will take place in London between 27 July-12 August 2012. \n Olympic sports \n IOC had limited the Summer Games program to a maximum of 28 sports, 301 events and 10,500 athletes. But the exclusion of baseball and softball from the official program after 2008 Beijing Olympics means 2012 London Games will feature just 26 sports. \n The 2016 and 2020 Games will return to the maximum of 28 sports with the addition of rugby and golf. \n Athletics, swimming, fencing and artistic gymnastics are the only sports that have been part of all Olympic programs so far. The only sport on the Olympic programme that features men and women competing together is the equestrian disciplines. \n With the addition of women's boxing to the programme in the 2012 London Olympics, female athletes will be able to compete in all the sports as men. But there are still more medal events for men than women in the Games. \n India at Olympics \n India first participated in Olympic Games in 1900 (Paris), with a lone athlete (Norman Pritchard) winning two silver medals in athletics. India first sent a team to the Summer Olympic Games in 1920, and has participated in every Summer Games since then. India has also competed at several Winter Olympic Games since 1964. \n But the more organised, official representation by India, was made in 1928 Amsterdam, with the formation of Indian Olympic Association in 1927. \n Indian athletes have won a total of 20 medals so far, mostly in field hockey (11).

He's also known as actress Jamie Lee Curtis's dad. \n IN THESE GROUPS \n “My longevity is due to my good timing.” \n “Where there is no art show, I would still be painting.” \n Tony Curtis \n Synopsis \n Born in New York on June 3, 1925, Tony Curtis's piercing blue eyes and good looks gained him a great deal of attention at a young age. After enlisting in the U.S. Navy and serving in World War II, the aspiring actor moved to Hollywood, California. His career took off following his high-profile marriage to Janet Leigh in 1951, which produced daughters Kelly Lee and Jamie Lee Curtis. In the late 1950s and '60s, Curtis starred in films like Houdini, Operation Petticoat, Some Like It Hot, The Defiant Ones and Spartacus. He later appeared in a variety of low-profile films and on various television shows. He died of cardiac arrest on September 30, 2010, in Henderson, Nevada. \n Early Life \n Tony Curtis was born Bernard Schwartz on June 3, 1925, in the Bronx, New York, to Hungarian Jewish immigrants Helen and Emanuel Schwartz. Curtis's father owned a tailor shop, and he and his family lived behind the business in a cramped apartment. His parents slept in one room, and Curtis shared the other with his two brothers, Julius and Robert. Curtis's mother suffered from schizophrenia, and often beat the boys. \n In 1933, during the economic struggles of the Great Depression, Curtis's parents could no longer care for the boys financially. Tony and Julius were placed in a state institution, where the boys were frequently involved in conflicts with anti-Semitic youngsters who often threw stones and started fistfights with the brothers. In 1938, Julius was hit by a truck and killed. He was 12 years old. \n Shaken by the loss, Curtis was determined to make a better life for himself and began attending Seward Park High School on Manhattan's Lower East Side. After graduation, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy, serving in World War II aboard the submarine U.S.S. Proteus. Following his honorable discharge from the military, Curtis began acting lessons in New York at the New School for Social Research, where his classmates included fellow Seward Park alumnus Walter Matthau. \n Career Highlights \n Tony Curtis's boyish good looks helped him to land a contract with Universal Pictures in 1948. During this time, he settled on the name Anthony Curtis, and began a series of small movie roles, including Criss Cross (1949), Francis (1950) and No Room for the Groom (1952). \n Thanks in large part to his high-profile marriage to Hollywood beauty Janet Leigh in 1951, Curtis went on to star in a string of successful roles in the late 1950s and '60s, including Houdini (1953), in which Leigh was his co-star. Other films include the military comedy Operation Petticoat (1959); the famed romantic comedy Some Like It Hot, with co-star Marilyn Monroe; and the Stanley Kubrick historical epic Spartacus (1960) which he co-starred along with Kirk Douglas and Laurence Olivier. \n Personal Life \n The star's career all but collapsed in 1962, however, when he divorced Janet Leigh after having an affair with 17-year-old German actress Christine Kaufmann. By then, he and Leigh had two children: Kelly Lee and  Jamie Lee Curtis. Curtis and Kaufmann married in 1963 and divorced in 1967. Shortly thereafter, in 1968, the actor married 23-year-old model Leslie Allen. Following their 1982 divorce, he would have three more marriages—to Andrea Savio (1984-1992), Lisa Deutsch (1993-1994) and Jill Vandenberg (from 1998 until his death in 2010). In addition to six different marriages, Curtis engaged in several high-profile romances with icons such as Marilyn Monroe and Natalie Wood. \n By", "parametric_answer": "schwarzenegger", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

For  example, number 2, Breeze, was \"Sufficient to move the branches of trees, and  Mill from 6 to 9 turns\" per minute, while at number 5, Very Fresh, \"Wind growing  noisy, and considerable agitation of Trees, Mill 18 [turns per minute] to ¾  Cloth.\" \n Smeaton's scale caught the attention of the Hydrographer to the British  Admiralty, Alexander Dalrymple. The Hydrographer was the person in charge of  gathering data and issuing charts, and a convenient, consistent way of noting  wind speed would be invaluable to the navy. Dalrymple changed the scale to 0 to  12, from Smeaton's 1 to 8, and changed the wind names to those usually used in  ships' logs.  And he brought his scale to the attention of Captain  Beaufort, who had distinguished himself by producing meticulous records.  \n The genius of Beaufort's addition to the scale was that he defined each name  and number by a description of the maximum amount of sail a man-of-war could  carry under those wind conditions. \n Force \n Hurricane \n Or that which no canvas could withstand. \n Notice that this scale depends on observation of a ship of a particular class  sailing into the wind (“clean full”), and. for force numbers 5 through 9, on such a  ship being in pursuit of an enemy vessel.3 This specificity was not much of a problem. Men-of-war were fairly standardized;  any sailor familiar with them (and most were) could observe sails and assign a  Beaufort number, and conversely, given a Beaufort force number, a sailor  could picture wind conditions. Blair Kinsman suggests that one value of the  scale to the Admiralty was that it facilitated courts-martial of captains who  failed to pursue with all possible vigor. \n In 1829 Beaufort was promoted to Hydrographer.  According to Scott Huler , the first official use of the  Beaufort scale occurred in 1831 when Beaufort directed  it be used on the second voyage of the Beagle, the expedition that took  Charles Darwin to the Galapagos (Beaufort had recommended him for the  job). \n On 28 December 1838, the Admiralty formally adopted  Beaufort's scale for “all Her Majesty's Ships and Vessels of War.” \n In August 1853, representatives of ten nations met  in Brussels (the First International Meteorological Conference). One of their  goals was to agree upon a standard format for the weather observations in ships'  logbooks; the scale they adopted for the wind was Beaufort's. In 1862, the British Board of Trade adopted the scale for commercial  vessels. When the International Meteorological Organization was formed (Vienna, 1873), it continued its predecessor's use of the Beaufort scale. \n Beaufort wind scale on land \n In the last quarter of the 19th century numerous  investigations were made with the goal of assigning a range of wind speeds to  each of Beaufort's numbers. The British Meteorological Office was active in this  work and in 1906 published a report with wind speed ranges. This  report also introduced descriptions of what would be observed on land at each  Beaufort number.

It is in the East of England, about 8 mi from the coast. It lies along the River Deben, with a population of about 11,000. The town is served by Woodbridge railway station on the Ipswich-Lowestoft East Suffolk Line and is located just a few miles from the wider Ipswich urban area. Woodbridge is twinned with Mussidan in France. Woodbridge is close to the most important Anglo-Saxon site in the United Kingdom, the Sutton Hoo burial ship.  With 1100 years of recorded history, the town has retained a variety of historical architecture, and there are facilities for boating and riverside walks on the River Deben. \n Governance \n Woodbridge lies in the Suffolk Coastal district of the shire county of Suffolk. The Town Council was formed in 1974 as a third-tier successor to the Urban District Council and has a mayor and 16 councillors elected for four wards.  The town lies in Suffolk Coastal parliamentary constituency and is currently represented by Conservative Therese Coffey.  and County Councillor Liberal Democrat Caroline Page. \n History and heritage \n Archaeological finds in the area show habitation from the Neolithic Age (2500-1700 B.C.). \n The area was under Roman occupation for 300 years following Queen Boadicca's failed rebellion in 59 A.D. but there is little evidence of the Romans' presence. When the Roman soldiers were recalled to Rome in 410 A.D., there was a substantial Anglo-Saxon (Germanic) settlement. It was the Angles who gave East Anglia its name. \n In the early 7th century King Rædwald of East Anglia was Bretwalda, the most powerful king in England. He died in around 624, and he is probably the king buried at Sutton Hoo, just across the river Deben from Woodbridge. The burial ship is 89 feet long, and when its treasures were discovered in 1939 they were the richest ever found in British soil. They are kept in the British Museum in London. Replicas of some items, and the story of the finds, are to be found in the Woodbridge Museum, and the National Trust has built a Visitor Centre on the site. \n The earliest record of Woodbridge dates from the mid-10th century, when it was acquired by St Aethelwold, bishop of Winchester, who made it a part of the endowment of the monastery he helped to refound at Ely, Cambridgeshire in AD 970.   The Domesday Book of 1086 describes Woodbridge as part of the Loes Hundred. Much of Woodbridge was granted to the powerful Bigod family, who built the famous castle at Framlingham. \n The town has been a centre for boat-building, rope-making and sail-making since the Middle Ages. Edward III and Sir Francis Drake had fighting ships built in Woodbridge.  The town suffered in the plague of 1349, but recovered enough, and with encouragement from the Canons, and growing general prosperity, to have a new church (now St. Mary's, behind the buildings on the south side of Market Hill) constructed with limestone from the Wash and decorated with Thetford flint. By the mid 15th century the Brews family had added a tower and porch. \n On 12 October 1534, Prior Henry Bassingbourne confirmed Henry VIII's supremacy over the Church and rejected the incumbent \"Roman Bishop\". Nonetheless, Woodbridge Priory was dissolved three years later.  \n As religious unrest continued in the reign of the Roman Catholic Mary Tudor, Alexander Gooch, a weaver of Woodbridge, and Alice Driver of Grundisburgh were burnt for heresy on Rushmere Heath. Alice previously had her ears cut off for likening queen Mary to Jezebel. The subsequent religious settlement under Elizabeth I helped Woodbridge industries such as weaving, sail-cloth manufacture, rope-making and salt making to prosper, along with the wool trade. The port was enlarged, and shipbuilding and timber trade became very lucrative, so that a customs house was established in 1589. \n Around the town there are various buildings from the Tudor, Georgian, Regency and Victorian eras.

Evocative names such as Humber, Morris, Hillman, Riley, Wolseley and Austin will bring back fond memories for those of us over a certain age. Announcing to an assembled gathering that you drive a Humber Super Snipe sounds so much more exciting than perhaps a modern day equivalent, Ford Mondeo 1.6 Edge! \n And so it was that The Yorkshire Times found itself earlier this month at The Classic Motor Show at Birmingham's sprawling NEC. With so many British and European Marques represented, a full day was needed to do the show justice. Many of the displays were organised by enthusiastic Owners Clubs, keen to preserve the heritage of their chosen make for generations to come. \n Jowett Lorry - built in 1931 \n One such stand housed a fine display of Jowett vehicles, Bradford-built and popular in their day, particularly in the north of England. Production at the factory ceased in 1954 after over 50 years of car and commercial vehicle production. \n So where did it all begin and why did this once thriving Yorkshire car manufacturer stop production? \n Benjamin and William Jowett founded the company in 1901, with Arthur Lamb. Initially making cycles and engines for driving machinery, the Jowett Motor Manufacturing Company was formed in 1904 and produced their first car in 1906. \n Production proper began in 1910 and the intention was to provide a low weight vehicle at a low price and with low running costs. Engine and gearboxes were made largely of aluminium and the car's low speed torque and gear ratios were ideally suited to the hilly Yorkshire roads. Top speed and acceleration were of little importance. A heady 48 cars were made before the onset of World War 1 and the factory was turned over to munitions manufacture. \n Jowett Javelin - built in 1952 (Cost £653 + tax when new) \n After the war, Jowett Cars Ltd was formed and a new site was bought in Idle, just outside Bradford. Production of the Jowett Seven began in 1920 and continued up to 1936. Commercial vehicles built on the car chassis came on stream in 1922 and were to form an important part of the business. 1934 saw the introduction of the Kestrel and Weasel sports tourer. \n Once again war would halt car production (the Ten and Eight models) and post war the business found a new owner in Charles Clore. His tenure was short and ownership passed to bankers Lazard Brothers in 1947. At the same time, the popular 'Javelin' saloon model was introduced alongside its 'Bradford' commercial brother. Over 70,000 were made over a seven year period (as well as a modest 900 'Jupiter' convertibles). \n The vehicles were a success, with stream-lined design and advanced features such as independent front suspension, unitary body construction and a flat four push-rod engine. The Javelin could achieve heady 80mph and handling was excellent. \n Poor business strategy was Jowett's downfall \n However, poor business strategy and direction was to be the financially sound company's downfall. Overproduction of car bodies, mechanical maladies and a collapsing export market conspired with a temporary large increase in purchase tax to create difficulties. Furthermore, the Idle plant was unable to produce the expected volume of vehicles, nor was the distribution network able to sell what was produced. Javelin production ceased in 1953 and although demand remained high, production of the pretty Jupiter followed suit at the end of 1954. \n Jowett Jupiter Convertible built in 1952 \n The company did not go bankrupt, but instead sold the factory to International Harvester, who made tractors at the site until the early 1980s. The building was subsequently demolished in 1983. \n Jowett continued for a short while as a manufacturer of aircraft parts and operated from a former mill at Howden Clough, Birstall, near Batley. \n Alive and Kicking! \n Jupiters and Javelins are very much alive", "parametric_answer": "austin", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

There is only one union confederation in the UK, the TUC, and individual unions are fully independent. Around 60% of trade unionists in the TUC are in the three largest unions, which have grown through mergers. \n There are 7,504,445 union members in the UK, according to figures provided by the unions themselves almost all in employment. 1 \n Figures from the annual official Labour Force Survey, which excludes non-working members, show a total of 6,755,000 union members in 2012, of whom 6,455,000 are employees. 2 \n (The remainder are likely to be self employed.) This is equivalent to 26.0% of all employees. The ICTWSS database of union membership put union density at 27.1% in 2010. 3 \n The vast majority – 5,977,178 – belong to the unions affiliated to the TUC, 4 \n the only trade union confederation in Britain. The TUC does not operate in Northern Ireland. Unions operating in both Britain and Northern Ireland are frequently also affiliated to the Irish trade union confederation the ICTU (see section on Ireland) through the Northern Ireland Committee of the ICTU. In total the ICTU has 218,514 members in Northern Ireland. 5 \n British unions are organised in a variety of ways. Some organise particular occupations such as teachers or radiographers, and, particularly in the finance industry, some just organise in a single company, such as Aegis, which covers the insurance and pensions group Aegon, or the Nationwide Group Staff Union for the Nationwide Building Society. However, the great majority of union members are now in large unions, formed by mergers, which have members in many sectors of the economy. Industry-based unions are now less common, although there are some, such as UCATT, the construction union. \n The largest union in the UK is Unite, a union formed in May 2007 through the merger of the previously second and third largest unions Amicus and the T&G. It had 1,407,399 members in January 2012 and they work in almost every sector of the economy, including motor manufacturing, printing, finance, road transport, and the health service. It is stronger in the private than the public sector, but it has at least 200,000 members in public services. \n UNISON, the second largest union with 1,317,500 members, organises primarily in the public services, although as a result of privatisation it has substantial membership in private companies. The third largest union is the GMB, with 610,116. Like Unite it is a general union with members in a number of industries, although they are more likely to be manual workers. The GMB was initially part of the merger discussions which led to the creation of Unite, but it pulled out in 2006, deciding to remain independent. \n These three unions account for 56% of total TUC membership and the two largest unions on their own account for 46%. \n The next group of TUC affiliated unions by size are smaller and are more linked to specific industries and occupations. They are: USDAW (412,441), which primarily organises shop workers but has members in other areas, two teaching unions, the NUT (324,387) and the NASUWT (293,855), PCS (280,547), which organises civil servants in central government, and the CWU (204,419), which covers postal and telecommunications workers, although not management grades. \n Individual unions are independent in terms of their decision-making, although the TUC has in the past been the main channel for discussions with government. \n There are only two significant unions, in terms of membership, which are not affiliated to the TUC – or any other body – and these are the RCN, which organises nurses and has 415,019 members, and the BMA, which organises doctors and has 144,428. 6 \n Around half the membership of the TUC belongs to unions that are", "parametric_answer": "unite union", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

Boeing bought Heath's shipyard in Seattle on the Duwamish River, which later became his first airplane factory.  Boeing was incorporated in Seattle by William Boeing, on July 15, 1916, as \"Pacific Aero Products Co\". Boeing was later incorporated in Delaware, the original Certificate of Incorporation was filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware on  July 19, 1934. Boeing, who studied at Yale University, worked initially in the timber industry, where he became wealthy and learned about wooden structures. This knowledge proved invaluable in his subsequent design and assembly of airplanes. The company stayed in Seattle to take advantage of the local supply of spruce wood.  \n William Boeing founded his company a few months after the June 15 maiden flight of one of the two \"B&W\" seaplanes built with the assistance of George Conrad Westervelt, a U.S. Navy engineer. Boeing and Westervelt decided to build the B&W seaplane after having flown in a Curtiss aircraft. Boeing bought a Glenn Martin \"Flying Birdcage\" seaplane (so called because of all the guy-wires holding it together) and was taught to fly by Glenn Martin himself. Boeing soon crashed the Birdcage and when Martin informed Boeing that replacement parts would not become available for months, Boeing realized he could build his own plane in that amount of time. He and his friend Cdr. G.C. Westervelt agreed to build a better airplane and soon produced the B&W Seaplane.   This first Boeing airplane was assembled in a lakeside hangar located on the northeast shore of Seattle's Lake Union. Many of Boeing's early planes were seaplanes. \n On May 9, 1917, the company became the \"Boeing Airplane Company\". In late 1917, the U.S. entered World War I and Boeing knew that the U.S. Navy needed seaplanes for training. So Boeing shipped two new Model Cs to Pensacola, Florida, where the planes were flown for the Navy. The Navy liked the Model C and ordered fifty more.  The company moved its operations to a larger former shipbuilding facility known as Boeing Plant 1, located on the lower Duwamish River. \n When World War I ended in 1918, a large surplus of cheap, used military planes flooded the commercial airplane market, and this prevented aircraft companies like Boeing from selling any new airplanes. Because of this, many airplane companies went out of business, but other companies, including Boeing, started selling other products. Boeing built dressers, counters, and furniture, along with flat-bottom boats called Sea Sleds. \n In 1919 the Boeing B-1 made its first flight. It was a flying boat that accommodated one pilot and two passengers and some mail. Over the course of eight years, it made international airmail flights from Seattle to Victoria, British Columbia.

More than a thousand troops under the command of General Antonio López de Santa Anna, the military dictator of Mexico, stormed the Alamo fortress in San Antonio, where Texan rebels against Mexican authorityï¿½Anglo-American settlers, Tejano natives, and soldiers of fortune from the United States and Europeï¿½had been waiting for reinforcements that never came. All of the defendersï¿½roughly 180 or moreï¿½were killed in battle or executed soon afterward. \n News of the fall of the Alamo sent shock waves far beyond war-torn Texas, where secessionists had just declared the independence of their republic. Among the fallen defenders were two celebrities from the United States. The knifefighter James Bowie was one. But his renown was overshadowed by that of David Crockett, the \"congressman from the canebrake\" of Tennessee who had replaced Daniel Boone as a symbol of the American frontiersman. After being defeated in a race for Congress, Crockettï¿½whom the Whig party had once considered as a possible presidential candidateï¿½had made his way to insurgent Texas to make a fresh start. A fellow graduate of Tennessee politics, Sam Houston, commander of the weak and disorganized Texan army, had assigned Crockett to the garrison at San Antonio. There, with Bowie and less known figures such as the garrison's young commander, William Barret Travis, Crockett met his death. \n In the legend that grew up around Crockett, he died fighting in the last-ditch defense of the Alamo. Recent scholarship, however, has suggested another possibility: that Crockett was executed by Santa Anna along with several others after the battle was over. I discovered just how controversial this question remains when I published The Alamo, a narrative poem about the Texas Revolution. In my first draft, I followed some recent historical accounts of the Texas Revolution that treat Crockett's execution at the hands of Santa Anna as an established fact. As I researched the subject further, however, I concluded that the story of Crockett's execution, like the equally well-known story of the line Travis drew in the dust at the Alamo, was folklore. In the final version of the poem, Travis does not draw that line, and Crockett, a minor character in the story I tell, falls in battle. In a vituperative attack on The Alamoin the New York Times, the journalist Garry Wills accused me (along with Wills's bête noire, the late John Wayne, in his movie The Alamo) of purveying patriotic \"hokum\" to the American public by showing Crockett being killed in battle. The ensuing debate has involved several exchanges in print between Wills and my fellow Texan, CBS news anchor Dan Rather. \n What this unexpected controversy revealed is that the death of Colonel David Crockettï¿½or \"Davy Crockett,\" as he became known in 19th-century almanacs and 20th-century pop cultureï¿½is a contested front in the late-20th-century American culture war. To understand why, we have to go back to the 1950s, when Walt Disney's TV series starring Fess Parker elevated \"Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier\" into the American hero. Crockett's mythic status was enhanced even further when John Wayne portrayed him in The Alamo (1960). \n Generational politics explains the controversy surrounding a purported 1836 memoir by a Mexican officer present at the battle, José Enrique de la Peña. (Because the memoir incorporates material that de la Peñ a could only have acquired later, it must have been completed after 1836.) In 1955 a Mexican antiquarian and book-seller named Jesñs Sánchez Garza published La Rebelión de Texas in Mexico City. The manuscript was acquired by a Texas philanthropist, John Peace, for his John Peace Memorial Library, at the University of Texas at San Antonio. In 1974, Peace gave his permission for Carmen Perry to undertake a translation, which was published in 1975 by Texas A&AMPM Press as With Santa Anna in Texas: A Personal Narrative", "parametric_answer": "jim bowie", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

Here are some suggestions of places to   fish each month based on historical catches. Be forewarned, however, they call   it fishing, not catching. Although these times have historically been the best   times to fish, there are no guarantees that they will be productive when you are   there! Also, be sure to check the regulations and make sure the area you want   to fish is open. Salmon regulations can change each year to protect weak   stocks, or even weekly if in-season updates indicate a particular run is weaker   or stronger than anticipated. While more salmon are caught in these places   during these times, these areas are traditionally very busy. If you are looking   for a more tranquil experience, you might want to avoid these areas and look for   an area that doesn’t have as many salmon caught each year, but also has a lot   less anglers. \n January \n Salmon opportunities are fairly limited in January. Best bets include   blackmouth fishing in Puget Sound where open, or chum fishing on the Nisqually   River. \n February \n There is really only one game in town during February, blackmouth fishing   in Puget Sound. Marine Areas 7, 8, and 9 are traditionally strong areas during   February. \n March \n The first spring chinook of the season will be pushing up the lower   Columbia. Blackmouth fishing will continue strong in Puget Sound. \n April \n April is prime time for Columbia River spring chinook   from the mouth to Bonneville Dam. By the end of the month, Wind River and Drano   Lake start to come on. Lower river tributaries such as the Cowlitz, Kalama, and   Lewis rivers will all be productive. Sleepers include the Quilayute and Sol Duc   rivers. \n May \n Early May is the time to hit Wind River and Drano Lake   for spring chinook. Other Columbia River tributaries to try include the Cowlitz,   Kalama, and Lewis, and way up the Columbia, Icicle River can by good if its   open. On the coast, try the Sol Duc River. \n June \n The Cowlitz, Lewis, and Icicle rivers will still be producing spring   chinook. If open, the lower Columbia River will be good for summer chinook. June   is the time to start getting excited about fishing in marine waters. Marine   Areas 11 and 13 will start to kick out some early returning adult chinook in   June. Ocean areas may open as early as late June and chinook fishing at   Westport, Neah Bay and LaPush will usually be good if they do. \n July \n The place to be in July is Neah Bay and LaPush. Columbia River chinook   will be migrating south and the first place they hit in Washington is Cape   Flattery. Chinook up to fifty pounds will be caught here in July. Coho will be   good at Illwaco. The selective chinook fishery (hatchery fish only) will be   going strong at Sekiu all month, while Port Angeles will take off towards the   end of the month. The Tulalip Bubble in Marine Area 8-2, and the Elliott Bay and   Sinclair Inlet fisheries in Area 10 will produce nice catches of chinook. Marine   Areas 11 and 13 will be building towards their peak chinook catches near the end   of the month. In odd numbered years, pink salmon will start to show at Neah Bay   and Sekiu. \n August \n Ocean: Start working   south towards Westport and Illwaco.

{"question": "Which official residence is No.12 Downing Street?", "answers": ["chief whip"], "context": "12 Downing Street12 Downing Street is one of the buildings situated on Downing Street in the City of Westminster in London, England. It has been traditionally used as the office of the Chief Whip although the upper floor forms part of the residential apartment for the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. It has been owned and used by the Crown since 1803, first housing the Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces and then the Colonial Office, before the office of the Chief Whip moved into the premises in 1879 until 2001. It is a Grade II listed building. \n Current use \n The offices of the Prime Minister in 10 Downing Street have spread into 12 Downing Street, connected by a corridor which runs through 11 Downing Street.  Under the current government, the building is being used to house the Prime Minister's Press Office and Strategic Communications Unit.   Although historically the house was used as the office of the Chief Whip, they are now located in 9 Downing Street.  The upper floor of 12 Downing Street forms part of the Prime Minister's personal apartment. This stretches from number 12 across to number 10 as a joint apartment.  \n Historical use \n The land which 12 Downing Street is built on was first sold by Charles Downing to James Steadman in 1723. The house was then sold in 1772 to William Maseres, who leased it three years later to Henry Hunt. This lease was bought out by Simon Frazer, who also acquired Maseres' stake in the property. After Frazer's death in 1783, it was sold by the executors to James Martin, who in turn sold it to the East India Company in 1803. It was purchased by the Crown in 1803, and was first used to house the Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces. In 1827, it was taken over by the Colonial Office. \n When Downing Street was remodelled in 1846, the houses at 10, 11 and 12 were joined together as a single overall building,  with the Colonial Office continuing to reside there. They moved out in 1879 and since then the house at 12 Downing Street has been historically used as the office of the Chief Whip of the Government,  and was also used for parliamentary dinners.  In 1854, Herbert Gladstone was born at 12 Downing Street, the son of then Chancellor of the Exchequer, William Ewart Gladstone. Herbert later became Home Secretary and the first Governor-General of the Union of South Africa.   \n During the First World War, the premises was the headquarters of the Parliamentary Recruitment Committee.  It was formed across parties, and managed by the three Chief Whips during the Second Asquith ministry of 1915-16.  Following the breakup of the coalition government, the Liberal Party Chief Whip, John Gulland was blamed in some parts of the media for disconnecting the phone line running to 12 Downing Street. This was denied, and a statement was issued to say that \"At no time was the telephone temporarily disconnected.\"  The building was made Grade II listed on 14 January 1970.  \n The residency of the Chief Whips at 12 Downing Street ended in 2001, when Alastair Campbell was moved into the location from an office in 10 Downing Street by Prime Minister Tony Blair. The Whips were moved to 9 Downing Street, previously only known as the Privy Council building. During Gordon Brown's period as Prime Minister, he moved the Press Office back out of 12 Downing Street and instead used it as an open-plan office for himself and his key advisers.

However, the relationship between the two nations was a tense one. Americans had long been wary of Soviet communism and concerned about Russian leader Joseph Stalin’s tyrannical, blood-thirsty rule of his own country. For their part, the Soviets resented the Americans’ decades-long refusal to treat the USSR as a legitimate part of the international community as well as their delayed entry into World War II, which resulted in the deaths of tens of millions of Russians. After the war ended, these grievances ripened into an overwhelming sense of mutual distrust and enmity. Postwar Soviet expansionism in Eastern Europe fueled many Americans’ fears of a Russian plan to control the world. Meanwhile, the USSR came to resent what they perceived as American officials’ bellicose rhetoric, arms buildup and interventionist approach to international relations. In such a hostile atmosphere, no single party was entirely to blame for the Cold War; in fact, some historians believe it was inevitable. \n Google \n The Cold War: Containment \n By the time World War II ended, most American officials agreed that the best defense against the Soviet threat was a strategy called “containment.” In 1946, in his famous “Long Telegram,” the diplomat George Kennan (1904-2005) explained this policy: The Soviet Union, he wrote, was “a political force committed fanatically to the belief that with the U.S. there can be no permanent modus vivendi [agreement between parties that disagree]”; as a result, America’s only choice was the “long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies.” President Harry Truman (1884-1972) agreed. “It must be the policy of the United States,” he declared before Congress in 1947, “to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation…by outside pressures.” This way of thinking would shape American foreign policy for the next four decades. \n Did You Know? \n The term \"cold war\" first appeared in a 1945 essay by the English writer George Orwell called \"You and the Atomic Bomb.\" \n The Cold War: The Atomic Age \n The containment strategy also provided the rationale for an unprecedented arms buildup in the United States. In 1950, a National Security Council Report known as NSC–68 had echoed Truman’s recommendation that the country use military force to “contain” communist expansionism anywhere it seemed to be occurring. To that end, the report called for a four-fold increase in defense spending. \n In particular, American officials encouraged the development of atomic weapons like the ones that had ended World War II. Thus began a deadly “arms race.” In 1949, the Soviets tested an atom bomb of their own. In response, President Truman announced that the United States would build an even more destructive atomic weapon: the hydrogen bomb, or “superbomb.” Stalin followed suit. \n As a result, the stakes of the Cold War were perilously high. The first H-bomb test, in the Eniwetok atoll in the Marshall Islands, showed just how fearsome the nuclear age could be. It created a 25-square-mile fireball that vaporized an island, blew a huge hole in the ocean floor and had the power to destroy half of Manhattan. Subsequent American and Soviet tests spewed poisonous radioactive waste into the atmosphere. \n The ever-present threat of nuclear annihilation had a great impact on American domestic life as well. People built bomb shelters in their backyards. They practiced attack drills in schools and other public places. The 1950s and 1960s saw an epidemic of popular films that horrified moviegoers with depictions of nuclear devastation and mutant creatures. In these and other ways, the Cold War was a constant presence in Americans’ everyday lives. \n The Cold War Extends to Space \n Space exploration served as another dramatic arena for Cold War competition.

{"question": "Which car company produces the Meriva model?", "answers": ["vauxhall"], "context": "Vauxhall Meriva (2003 - 2010) review | Car review | RAC DriveVauxhall Meriva (2003 - 2010) review review | Car review | RAC Drive \n BY ANDY ENRIGHT \n Introduction \n Vauxhall has had to put up with a fair degree of mud slinging down the years, most of which suggested that under General Motors, the company had become so bureaucratic that it could no longer respond to rapidly changing markets in an adequately timely fashion. In more recent years, that line of argument has begun to look increasingly shaky, thanks to the introduction of a whole range of niche-orientated more versatile vehicles. First the Zafira mini-MPV offered the cleverest seating system known to man and then the Meriva supermini-MPV arrived to offer much of this utility in an even smaller package. With these two models on board, Vauxhall's more conventional passenger cars were able to become sleeker and more stylish - two attributes that had rarely been levelled at Astras and Corsas. Everyone was a winner. But why buy something conventional when you could have something really rather clever? Something like a used Vauxhall Meriva for instance. With examples now beginning to appear on the market in meaningful numbers, a nearly new model offers all the technology at a fraction of the price. \n Models \n Models Covered: (5dr supermini-MPV 1.4, 1.6, 1.8 petrol, 1.7 DTi diesel, 1.7 CDTi diesel [Expression, Life, Enjoy, Design]) \n History \n There's a lot more to the Meriva than meets the eye. Many expected a sort of inflated Vauxhall Corsa but despite being broadly Corsa-based, the Meriva seems more than the sum of its parts. Introduced in May 2003, the car was an instant success, if not revolutionising the market in quite the same fashion as its Zafira big brother. Instead it capitalised on the perceived weakness of Ford's offering in this sector, the Fusion, and arrived at a time when Renault had no model to speak of (the Modus only residing on a designer's CAD station at the time). Peugeot could only offer the half-baked 206SW, MG Rover drew a blank and Fiat's Idea was still forming in the Italian manufacturer's mind. In short, the Meriva had a virtually unchallenged run of it at first. Four engines were offered, 8v and 16v 1.6-litre units and a 1.8-litre petrol powerplant and the pick of the crop, the 1.7-litre CDTi diesel. Four trim levels were offered - the rather cheesily titled Expression, Life, Enjoy and Design. An early 2006 facelift which amounted to reprofiled bumpers, a V-shaped Vauxhall grille, dark lenses for the rear light clusters and a chrome bar running across the tailgate also yielded two new engines. A 1.6-litre Twinport petrol unit and a 1.3-litre CDTi were introduced to bolster the range. Shortly afterwards, the high-performance VXR model arrived with a 180bhp 1.6-litre turbo engine. \n What You Get \n As with any vehicle that touts itself as some sort of MPV, the Meriva stands or falls on more practical considerations such as interior space, the ingenuity of its seating system, passenger access and overall comfort. It's here that the Meriva comes up trumps. Just as Vauxhall aced the opposition with the Zafira's Flex7 seating system, the Meriva aims to do likewise with its less snappily titled FlexSpace arrangement. With five seats to play with, the Meriva doesn't have as many tricks up its sleeve as the Zafira, but you'll still be able to wow your passengers with a few deft flicks of the wrist. Most of the time, the Meriva functions as a conventional five seat supermini-MPV, but many of us have tried travelling five up in cars like these and it can feel a bit of a pinch. The Meriva goes some way to alleviating the problem by offering one of the widest rear passenger shoulder width measurements in its class, but the real benefit comes when travelling with four rather than five aboard. The centre seat can fold flat into the footwell, leaving the two remaining seats at liberty to slide independently, not only backwards and forwards, but also on runners from side to side. This makes the Meriva feel extremely spacious indeed", "parametric_answer": "opel", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

At last she went to a fairy, and said, \"I should so very much like to have a little child; can you tell me where I can find one?\"     \"Oh, that can be easily managed,\" said the fairy. \"Here is a barleycorn of a different kind to those which grow in the farmer's fields, and which the chickens eat; put it into a flower-pot, and see what will happen.\"     \"Thank you,\" said the woman, and she gave the fairy twelve shillings, which was the price of the barleycorn. Then she went home and planted it, and immediately there grew up a large handsome flower, something like a tulip in appearance, but with its leaves tightly closed as if it were still a bud.     \"It is a beautiful flower,\" said the woman, and she kissed the red and golden-colored leaves, and while she did so the flower opened, and she could see that it was a real tulip. Within the flower, upon the green velvet stamens, sat a very delicate and graceful little maiden. She was scarcely half as long as a thumb, and they gave her the name of \"Thumbelina,\" or Tiny, because she was so small. A walnut-shell, elegantly polished, served her for a cradle; her bed was formed of blue violet-leaves, with a rose-leaf for a counterpane. Here she slept at night, but during the day she amused herself on a table, where the woman had placed a plateful of water. Round this plate were wreaths of flowers with their stems in the water, and upon it floated a large tulip-leaf, which served Tiny for a boat. Here the little maiden sat and rowed herself from side to side, with two oars made of white horse-hair. It really was a very pretty sight.

In “Starting Out in the Evening,” he played a writer in his 70s, struggling to finish what will surely be his final novel, and his ability to let emotion fade to and from his face like dawn and twilight was heartbreaking. Now, in “Frost/Nixon,” he’s starring in a film that people will likely see, in a role that’s a tour de force (and that he previously played to great acclaim on stage). For Langella, who’s never had an Oscar nomination and whose leading roles in feature films are rare, it’s high time. \n His role in “Frost/Nixon” could have all too easily fallen into caricature: former President Nixon, with his rumbly growl and jowly grimaces. The film, adapted by Peter Morgan (“The Queen”) from his own play and directed by Ron Howard, is a sprightly yet ultimately haunting rendering of the events surrounding Nixon’s historic series of television interviews with British talk-show host David Frost in 1977, three years after he resigned from the presidency. Marvelously enacted by Michael Sheen (who played the role opposite Langella on stage as well), Frost is a chipper, ever-smiling glad-hander who stands in sharp opposition to his dour interview subject; indeed their initial meeting is set up like two opposing troops marching into battle. “I’ve never been challenged to a duel before,” intones Nixon to Frost, whose smile quickly fades. Clearly, the former president welcomes the challenge. \n Langella’s Nixon is a sly negotiator with an unexpected knack for folksy humor (hearing the cost of the broadcast, he exclaims, “Geez, I didn’t realize we were making ‘Ben-Hur’ “) and a deep sensitivity to questions about the scandal he pronounces as “Wudder-gate.” (Langella slips easily into the basement of that familiar Nixon rumble, rarely changing pitch.) His shoulders slump, but his eyes blaze; there’s still plenty of fight in him. “When the president does it,” he says, in an electrifying exchange in the interviews, “that means it’s not illegal. But I realize no one else shares that view.” \n Most Read Stories \n Unlimited Digital Access.  $1 for 4 weeks. \n Morgan’s adaptation opens out the play effectively, zipping us from Washington to London to California and introducing a host of supporting characters, some of whom narrate the film in faux-documentary style: a tight-jawed Kevin Bacon as Nixon loyalist Jack Brennan; Sam Rockwell as writer and Frost’s chief Watergate researcher James Reston Jr., who memorably described the former president’s face as “swollen and ravaged by loneliness, self-loathing and defeat.” (The talented Rebecca Hall, however, is wasted in a throwaway role as Frost’s love interest.) \n Howard gives it all an appealing, speedy pace, but most important he gives his two lead actors room to create their complicated, showy characters. Nixon, at film’s end, is ultimately a terribly sad figure, as Langella conveys, sometimes wordlessly, his heavy burden of failure and lack of self-awareness. (You sense that he knew he did wrong but doesn’t know what he would have done differently.)

It is found mainly in western and southern Europe including Britain. It is also known as the Common Primrose and the English Primrose. \n What is Primrose Day? \n Primrose Day was a special day in memory of British Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli (Lord Beaconsfield), who died on 19 April 1881. \n When was Benjamin Disraeli Prime Minister? \n Disraeli  served as Prime Minister in 1868 and again from 1874 to 1880. He was Britain's first, and thus far only, Jewish Prime Minister. \n What made him special to have a celebration day? \n England's Primrose day sprang from a friendship between Benjamin Disraeli and Queen Victoria. They were brought together through their love for their country (patriotism). \n Why are primroses associated with Benjamin Disraeli? \n Queen Victoria sent a wreath of primroses to Disraeli's funeral with a note stating that they were \"his favourite flowers\". From reading the note people assumed that the 'his' referred to Disraeli, however, it is now thought that Victoria may have been referring to her late husband, Prince Albert. \n How was the day celebrated? \n People paid tribute to the statesman by wearing primroses. \n The bronze statue of Lord Beaconsfield in Parliament Square was decorated with primroses every year on the anniversary of his death. \n Also on this day...... \n At 6 p.m. on 19 April 1770 Lieutenant Hicks became the first European to sight Australia. He was one of James Cook's crew on the Endeavour.

She left home at age 12 to attend Epsom Girls Grammar School in Auckland . After graduation, she enrolled in the University of Auckland, where she received bachelor’s (1971) and master’s (1974) degrees in political science and taught from 1973 to 1981. \n Clark joined the Labour Party in 1971 and during the following decade held a variety of positions within the party. In parliamentary elections in 1975, she was selected as the Labour candidate for a seat that was considered safe for the conservative National Party . Although she lost that election, she was elected to Parliament from a different constituency in 1981. As chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Defence Select Committee (1984–87), she played a major role in the country’s adoption of an antinuclear policy, which effectively ended the ANZUS Pact and led to reduced military ties between New Zealand and the United States . In 1987 Clark became a member of the cabinet, holding at various times the portfolios of housing, conservation , labour , and health . In 1989–90 she served as deputy prime minister, and in 1990 she was appointed to the Privy Council , becoming the first woman in New Zealand to hold those offices. \n After the National Party’s return to power in 1990, Clark became deputy leader of the opposition in Parliament. In 1993 she was elected head of the Labour Party —becoming the first woman in New Zealand to head a major party—and thus served as leader of the opposition. In 1999, when the Labour Party was able to form a governing coalition, Clark was elected prime minister. Holding the portfolio of arts and culture herself, she appointed an extraordinarily diverse cabinet, including 11 women and 4 Maori . As prime minister, Clark addressed many controversial issues, including Maori rights, same-sex civil unions, and prostitution, which was legalized in 2003. Her government also opposed the U.S. and British invasion of Iraq (see Iraq War ). She was reelected prime minister in both 2002 and 2005, the first New Zealand prime minister to secure three consecutive terms in office. Amid an economic downturn, Clark’s Labour Party was defeated by John Key and the National Party in the 2008 election. Clark subsequently stepped down as Labour leader.

The Volga River is the largest river to flow into the Caspian Sea, flowing into the northern coast of the sea, followed by the Ural River located to its east. The Kura River enters the Caspian Sea from the west, as it travels from Turkey to Azerbaijan. \n Full Answer \n The Samur River flows into the Caspian Sea through Azerbaijan, while the Sulak River and Terek River flow into the sea from Georgia, where they travel to from Russia. The Kuma River flows into the Caspian Sea from Russia. The Volga River is responsible for about 80 percent of the flow into the Caspian Sea, aided by its many tributaries, including the Samara, Chapayevka, Sok, Aktay, Yeruslan, Tereshka, Tsivil, Rutka, Nara, Protva and Ugra. About 10 percent of the remaining water is supplied by the Kura, Terek, Ural and Surak Rivers. All of these rivers flow into the Caspian Sea from either then north or the west.

He later moved to Kendal and devoted his life to mapping the area, writing seven guidebooks. His Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells are a unique mixture of beautiful pen-and-ink sketches, maps and musings. \n Wainwright died in 1991 and there is a memorial to him in the church at Buttermere. His ashes were scattered above the village on his favourite mountain, Haystacks. \n Definition of a Wainwright \n A Wainwright is the summit of what A.W. - as he preferred to be called - thought were true fell tops. There are 214 ‘Wainwrights’ which many walkers try to get to the top of or ‘bag’. \n Wainwright walks in 2016 \n List of our Wainwright summit walks in 2016 \n Quotations \n “Haystacks stands unabashed and unashamed in the midst of a circle of much loftier fells, like a shaggy terrier in the company of foxhounds… For a man trying to get a persistent worry out of his mind, the top of Haystacks is a wonderful cure.” \n “Time is intended to be spent, not saved”. \n “Much of Lakeland’s appeal derives from the very lovely names of its mountains and valleys and lakes and rivers, which fit the scenery so well. These names were given by the earliest settlers, rough men, invaders and robbers: they were here long before Wordsworth – but they too, surely had poetry in their hearts?” \n More information  Alfred Wainwright - Lake DistrictAlfred Wainwright. \n Alfred Wainwright \n (1907 - 1991) \n Alfred Wainwright, fellwalker, illustrator and author of the famous    'Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells', was born in 1907 at the town of Blackburn in Lancashire, the son of a stonemason. \n Due to his father's alcoholism, the young Alfred had a relatively poor upbringing, nevertheless he did extremely well at school. He left school at thirteen and began his    career as an office boy in Blackburn Borough Engineer Department.   He spent several further years studying at night school, gaining qualifications in accountancy. \n At the age of 23, Wainwright took a week's holiday, fellwalking in the Lake District with a cousin, Eric Beardsall. It was the start      of a love affair with the Lake District which was to last for the rest of his life. Wainwright's first        Lakeland fell was Orrest Head with its stunning views of Lake Windermere and the Lakeland Fells. Orrest Head remains today just as Wainwright would have seen it. A  plaque to his memory, recording the event, now stands at the summit. \n He married for  the first time in 1931 to a local mill worker, Ruth Holden, the marriage produced one child, named Peter. A job at the Borough Treasurer's Office at Kendal allowed Wainwright to move closer to the Lake District, after which he began to climb the fells in earnest. His love of fell-walking was obsessional,  he set out by bus and regularly walked alone whatever the weather, to challenge the Lake District peaks  before painstakingly committing his experiences to paper when he arrived home. He stayed in Kendal for the remainder of his life, serving in the post of Borough Treasurer from 1948 until his retirement in 1967. His first marriage to Ruth was later disolved just before he retired. A few years later he met his second wife Betty, who was also a divorcee. \n Wainwright started  his famous 'Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells', a series of handwritten and hand drawn books, on 9 November 1952 . Meticulously planned out, he worked on the seven volumes which followed for the next thirteen years, completing one page per evening. The early editions were published by his friend Henry Marshall, Chief Librarian of Kendal and Westmorland, a local newspaper, the Westmorland    Gazette later assumed the role. \n The pictorial guides were followed by the Pennine Way Companion in 1968 and in 1973 he", "parametric_answer": "helvellyn", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}
{"question": "Snail porridge is a dish associated with which famous chef?", "answers": ["big fat duck cookbook", "heston blumenthal"], "context": "Porridge: How Porridge is Now Trendy - Fine Dining LoversPorridge: How Porridge is Now Trendy \n By James Brennan on \n December 07, 2012 \n Porridge is the winter staple that’s as much superfood as comfort food. It’s tasty, healthy and warming, which is why more people are turning to oatmeal to kick-start their day. \n A bowl of porridge oats is nutritious, packed with energy and armed to the hilt with vitamins, minerals, protein and fibre. But while it’s traditionally thought of as a solid and dependable breakfast option, it’s also being rediscovered and reinvented in some of the world’s top kitchens. \n Heston Blumenthal famously brought the humble porridge oat slithering bang up to date with his snail porridge. The Fat Duck chef combined high-quality porridge oats with snails, butter, fennel and parma ham to create a dish that confounded critics. It also helped to redefine an everyday grain that has largely been cooked the same way for hundreds of years. \n So how did oats become haute? Porridge has been associated with Scotland since before medieval times. The crop was ideally suited to the wet, dull conditions there, and became an important means of sustenance for both people and animals. To this day, the Scots enjoy oats in the form of oatcakes and skirlie, a dish of oats fried in lard with onions which forms the basis of white pudding. Oats are also an important ingredient in haggis. \n In their natural state the oats have husks, which are removed to create groats. Pinhead or steel-cut oatmeal, made when the groats are cut into two or three pieces, is ideal for tasty and textured porridge. For a smoother texture, there’s coarse or medium oats, which are gently ground. \n Rolled oats are easier and quicker to cook. These have been steamed and rolled into flakes, but lose a little nutritional value in the process. Large, flat Jumbo oats are rolled from whole groats and can be eaten raw in muesli. \n When there’s frost on the ground outside, however, there’s nothing like waking up to a hot breakfast of creamy porridge oats. The traditional Scottish method is to soak the oats in water overnight before gently boiling until soft, then adding salt. Constant stirring with a spurtle (porridge stirrer) is essential to make the porridge lighter and less prone to lumps (although we expect a spoon will do just as good a job). Stirring also helps to release more starch to produce creamier porridge. But you’ll need a strong arm, because some say good porridge needs to be cooked and stirred for up to two hours. \n But porridge oats are no longer the exclusive preserve of dour, firm-jawed Scotsmen, standing at the stove-side in their kilts, a bucket of salt in one hand and a knobbly spurtle in the other. Porridge has gone gourmet. \n A bowl’s roll from New York’s Washington Square is OatMeals, a restaurant dedicated to the art of reinventing porridge. Chef Samantha Stephens offers a range of inventive sweet and savoury oatmeal creations. Her Pomegranate Pistachio oatmeal features dried seeds, nuts, honey and almond milk, while her Truffle Risotto combines parmesan cheese, truffle oil, sea salt and cracked black pepper. Other bowls include unconventional ingredients such as sun-dried tomatoes, pesto and gorgonzola, proving that porridge can be every bit as versatile as rice. \n London is getting in on the act too. At Brick Lane’s Sunday Upmarket you can find bowls of steaming hot porridge laced with rashers of crispy bacon. The man behind this unlikely combo is Jonny Stanley, who takes dry-cured back bacon and mixes it with porridge oats made with milk and water for a slow-release energy breakfast. \n While traditionalists insist on porridge oats with a sprinkling of salt and nothing else, others stick with the sweet option. Drizzled with maple syrup or honey, or sprinkled with muscovado sugar and sliced strawberries, bananas or blueberries, porridge can come to life with a multitude of creative toppings. If you’re undecided, April Bloomfield of New York’s The Spotted Pig suggests a compromise. Her porridge involves a", "parametric_answer": "gordon ramsay", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}
{"question": "In which year was the £2 coin issued and introduced in the UK, although minted in the previous year?", "answers": ["1998"], "context": "Two pounds (British coin)The British two pound (£2) coin is a denomination of the pound sterling. Its obverse has featured the profile of Queen Elizabeth II since the coin’s introduction. Three different portraits of the Queen have been used, with the latest design by Jody Clark being introduced in 2015. The reverse features an abstract design symbolising the history of technological achievement. A new reverse design featuring Britannia began to enter circulation during 2015. \n The coin was introduced on 15 June 1998 (coins minted 1997) after a review of the United Kingdom's coinage decided that a general-circulation £2 coin was needed.  The new bi-metallic design replaced a series of commemorative, uni-metallic coins which were issued between 1986 and 1996 to celebrate special occasions. Although legal tender, these coins have never been common in everyday circulation. \n As of March 2014 there were an estimated 417 million £2 coins in circulation with an estimated face value of £831.756 million.  \n Design \n The original reverse of the coin, designed by Bruce Rushin, is an abstract design symbolising the history of technological achievement, accompanied by the words TWO POUNDS above, and the year of minting below. \n This was the first bi-metallic coin to be produced for circulation in Britain since the tin farthing with a copper plug produced in 1692, and is the highest denomination coin in common circulation in the UK. The coin consists of an outer yellow metal nickel-brass ring made from 76% copper, 20% zinc, and 4% nickel, and an inner steel-coloured cupro-nickel disc made from 75% copper, 25% nickel. The coin weighs 12 grams and is 28.4 millimetres in diameter. \n The design itself was first tried out in 1994 when the Royal Mint produced a short run of demonstration pieces to the new bi-metal standard. These pieces were not for circulation and were simply intended to test the manufacturing process. The coin was technically similar to the version which eventually entered circulation with the Maklouf effigy of Queen Elizabeth II on the obverse and the image of a sailing ship similar to that previously used on the reverse of the pre-decimal halfpenny piece. The inscription on the reverse read ROYAL MINT TRIAL 1994 with an edge inscription based on the one pound coin which read DECUS ET TUTAMEN ANNO REGNI XLVI, meaning \"An ornament and a safeguard – in the 46th year of her reign\". The 1994 pieces were never legal tender but were eventually released for sale as part of a presentation set in 1998. At the same time in 1994 the Royal Mint produced a mono-metallic trial two-pound coin, with the same ship reverse and inscription, but otherwise similar to the earlier commemorative coins. These were never issued in presentation sets, and so are much scarcer than the bi-metallic version. \n Because of technical difficulties, the 1997-dated coins, which bear the effigy of Queen Elizabeth II by Raphael Maklouf, were not released to circulation until June 1998 (the same time as the 1998-dated coins). 1998 and later dated coins bear the effigy of the Queen by Ian Rank-Broadley. The Maklouf-effigy coins bear the inscription ELIZABETH II DEI GRATIA REGINA F D on the obverse; the Rank-Broadley coins bear the inscription ELIZABETH II DEI GRA REG FID DEF. \n The reverse of the regular-issue coin, designed by Bruce Rushin, bears a concentric design symbolically representing technological development from the Iron Age, through the Industrial Revolution and the Electronic Age to the Internet, with the inscription TWO POUNDS above the design and the date below. An oddity of the design is that it depicts nineteen interlocking gears. Because there is an odd number of them, the mechanism could not actually turn (except as a Möbius strip). The coin has the edge inscription STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS taken from a letter by Isaac Newton to Robert Hooke, in which he describes how his work was built on the knowledge of those that had gone before him. \"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\" (Newton was Warden and later Master of the", "parametric_answer": "1986", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

Photograph: Lindsey Parnaby/PA \n Maev Kennedy , arts and heritage correspondent \n Monday 8 December 2003 04.57 EST \n Share on Messenger \n Close \n Just as predicted, it was sex and death which won the Turner prize last night. What the bookmakers missed, however, was that the medium for the message was not the Chapman Brothers' rotting corpses and mutilated Goyas, but Grayson Perry's troublingly beautiful pots. \n The judges' verdict was anything but a foregone conclusion: it took hours longer than usual to reach a decision, and they went out of their way to praise \"the outstanding presentations produced by all four artists\". But, in the end, Perry's use of the traditions of ceramics and drawing, and his \"uncompromising engagement with personal and social concerns\" put him out front. \n His £20,000 prize, presented by Sir Peter Blake, will have to be shared with Claire, the burliest glamour girl in town, whose ruched satin \"coming out dress\", exquisitely embroidered with phallic symbols, hangs on one wall of his exhibition gallery. \n Claire is the alter ego of Basildon-born Perry - who is 43, six foot tall, and married with a daughter - and makes regular appearances at art scene parties. Her blue and white satin Bo-Peep outfit, complete with ribboned crook, is particularly unforgettable. \n Despite his maverick status, he has spoken of the contemporary art scene as a second family: \"There aren't many other worlds that would be so accepting of a transvestite potter from Essex.\" \n The Chapman Brothers were favourites from the start to take the £20,000 prize, but in recent weeks Tate staff noticed that while visitors were laughing or gasping at their plastic sex dolls cast in bronze and frozen in desolating oral sex, they were spending hours in the next gallery, poring in silence over Grayson Perry's seductively coloured pots. These are incised with a nightmare world of child abuse and violence, a landscape of tower blocks and burned out cars stalked by murderous moppets in Kate Greenaway frilly dresses. One is called We've Found The Body Of Your Child. Another pot, Boring Cool People, pokes fun at the very arty types now flocking to his shows and paying up to £25,000 for his vases - a price which can now safely be predicted to rise dramatically. \n One of his Turner prize pots is topped by a beautifully executed in-joke, a gilt teddy bear impaled on a tiny tree, echoing the corpses hanging from a life-size tree in the Chapmans' gallery next door. \n The comments wall for visitors confirmed the trend. By the end of last week far more were voting for Perry - \"great, great, great pots\" one wrote - than for the Chapmans. Between them the artists left the other contenders, Willie Doherty's angsty video piece of a man running desperately across an endless bridge, and Anya Gallaccio's decaying flowers and seeping apples, trailing far in their wake. \n Grayson Perry's unique style was created 25 years ago, when he was living in a squat in Camden, where it was not common practice among the anarchic denizens to attend pottery classes. His first plate was inscribed Kinky Sex, and he has said he partly enjoyed pottery \"because it was so easy\". \n From the age of 13 he knew he was a cross-dresser, he has said, adding that the secret was discovered when his stepsister spied in his diary, and asked their mother what \"transvestism\" meant. \n He has already said that he might spend some of the prize money on his wife and daughter, and some on new dresses for Claire. \"Believe me, Claire's a very expensive woman to keep in clothes.\" \n The Stuckists, apostles of painting over conceptual art, and self-appointed scourges of \"the Serota tendency\" (named after", "parametric_answer": "yayoi kusama", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

However, Tendulkar has compensated for those areas with excellent shot selection and placement.  \n I always maintain that Test cricket and one-day cricket are two different areas, one cannot be connected to the other.

Then Guerrero further stepped in it by saying “I’m the first Mexican American to win titles in four divisions.” \n Guerrero seems to be forgetting a fighter by the name of Oscar De La Hoya, who before he retired in 2008, won six division world titles in different divisions. For the record, De La Hoya won world titles in the following divisions: 1. Super featherweight 2. Lightweight 3. Light welterweight 4. Welterweight 5. Junior middleweight 6. Middleweight. \n As far as Guerrero’s assertion that he’s now won four world titles in different divisions, he’s actually only won two world titles and those were at featherweight and super featherweight. Last year, Guerrero won Interim [WBA/WBO] in the lightweight division. Guerrero did not win the full world titles, and for a fighter to say that he’s a won a world title in a division, he has to actually win the regular title. Interim titles don’t count as far as I’m concerned. Last night, Guerrero won the interim WBC welterweight title. Again, Guerrero didn’t win the full WBC welterweight, because that title belongs to Mayweather. \n It was also interesting to see Guerrero trying to lure Mayweather into a fight by challenging him to come try and take his interim title off of him. Guerrero said “If Floyd wants the [interim] belt, it’s right here.” \n Why would Mayweather want to come and try to take Guerrero’s interim title when it’s not really a title? Like I said, Guerrero seemed to have had a  base case of motormouth last night without really thinking about what he was saying to see if it made sense or was accurate.

{"question": "Which British Prime Minister was born in Portsmouth in 1912?", "answers": ["james callaghan"], "context": "BBC - History - James CallaghanBBC - History - James Callaghan \n z \n James Callaghan     © Callaghan was British Labour prime minister from 1976 to 1979, years dominated by economic recession and industrial militancy which contributed to the election of the Conservatives and Labour's exclusion from office for the next 18 years. \n Callaghan was born on 27 March 1912 in Portsmouth and began working life for the Inland Revenue at the age of 16. He served in the Royal Navy during World War Two and in 1945 was elected Labour member of parliament for Cardiff South. In 1964, he was chosen by Labour prime minister Harold Wilson to be chancellor of the exchequer. His effectiveness at the Treasury, however, was limited by his resolute refusal to devalue the pound, which left British exports highly uncompetitive, and also by a power struggle with George Brown's Department of Economic Affairs, a new ministry deliberately created by Wilson to limit the power of the treasury. When devaluation became unavoidable in 1967, Callaghan was moved to the home office. Here he adopted an authoritarian and conservative line. He also took the decision to deploy British troops to Northern Ireland in 1969 after sectarian violence in the province. \n Callaghan also made a decisive intervention against Barbara Castle's plans for a wages policy in 1969, a move that reinforced his credentials as a staunch ally of the trade unions, but also contributed to the unravelling of Labour's economic strategy in the 1970s. After serving as foreign secretary in 1974-1976, Callaghan succeeded Wilson as prime minister in 1976. He responded to Britain's deepening economic recession by adopting deflationary policies and cuts in public expenditure, which anticipated the monetarism of Margaret Thatcher after 1979. \n He succeeded in securing some improvement in the nation's situation, but then committed a tactical error in postponing a general election until the spring of 1979, only to see his government totally discredited by mass industrial militancy during the 1978-1979 'winter of discontent'. He resigned as leader soon after the 1979 election, and later became a life peer. He died on 26 March 2005.

The only distinction between the two seems to be that originally Satyrs were considered to have human feet and a longer horse-like tail.  Over time though, they took on far more goat like aspects as they became conflated with the Roman Fauns. \n Satyr \n In Greek mythology, satyrs were woodland creatures depicted as having the pointed ears, legs, and short horns of a goat and a fondness for unrestrained revelry.  They are often associated with sex drive and vase-painters often portrayed them with uncontrollable erections.(!)  Mature satyrs are often depicted with goat's horns, while juveniles are often shown with bony nubs on their foreheads.  Painted vases depict satyrs as being strongly built with flat noses, large pointed ears, long curly hair, and full beards, with wreaths of vine or ivy circling their heads. Satyrs often carry the thyrsus : the rod of Dionysus tipped with a pine cone.  It was said they roamed the woods and mountains, and were the companions of Pan and Dionysus . \n They are described as roguish but faint-hearted folk; subversive and dangerous, yet shy and cowardly. Satyrs are not immortal, and they age.  As Dionysiac creatures they are lovers of wine, women and boys, and are ready for every physical pleasure. They roam to the music of pipes, cymbals, castanets, and bagpipes, and love to dance with the nymphs (with whom they are obsessed, and whom they often pursue), and dance to the rhythm of sikinnis. Because of their fondness of wine, they are often represented holding winecups, and appear often in the decorations on winecups. \n Faun \n In Roman mythology, fauns are place-spirits (genii) of untamed woodland, and are said to be the guardians of the woods and fields.  This combined with their similar temperament caused them to be associated with the Greek satyr.  They take their name from god named Faunus and a goddess Bona Dee or Fauna , who were their creators. \n Christian mythology demonised all pagan nature spirits such as satyrs & fauns by associating them with demons and devils, and their resemblance to the Jewish goat-man demon Azazel caused them to be the template for popular depictions of Satan. \n Depictions of fauns and satrys can be readily found in classical texts on up through modern films and literature.

The smallest country on the mainland of the continent is The Gambia. \n Full Answer \n Seychelles has an area of 177 square miles, or 455 square kilometers, which is around 2.5 times the size of Washington, D.C., The Gambia has an area of 4,007 square miles, or 11,295 square kilometers, a little less than twice the size of Delaware. The Gambia is so small because the British created it as a colony expressly in order to control the Gambia River, which flows through the middle of the country. Therefore, it consists primarily of the river and the land on the side of the river and not much else.  AfricaAfrica is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers six percent of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 percent of its total land area.Sayre, April Pulley (1999), Africa, Twenty-First Century Books. ISBN 0-7613-1367-2. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition.  \n Africa's population is the youngest amongst all the continents;   the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4.  Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria by population. Africa, particularly central Eastern Africa, is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade (great apes), as evidenced by the discovery of the earliest hominids and their ancestors, as well as later ones that have been dated to around seven million years ago, including Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Australopithecus africanus, A. afarensis, Homo erectus, H. habilis and H. ergaster – with the earliest Homo sapiens (modern human) found in Ethiopia being dated to circa 200,000 years ago.  Africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate areas; it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern temperate zones.  \n Africa hosts a large diversity of ethnicities, cultures and languages. In the late 19th century European countries colonized most of Africa. Most present states in Africa originate from a process of decolonization in the 20th century. \n Etymology \n Afri was a Latin name used to refer to the inhabitants of Africa, which in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya).   This name seems to have originally referred to a native Libyan tribe; see Terence#Biography for discussion. The name is usually connected with Hebrew or Phoenician  'dust', but a 1981 hypothesis  has asserted that it stems from the Berber ifri (plural ifran) \"cave\", in reference to cave dwellers.  The same word may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from Algeria and Tripolitania, a Berber tribe originally from Yafran (also known as Ifrane) in northwestern Libya.  \n Under Roman rule, Carthage became the capital of the province of Africa Proconsularis, which also included the coastal part of modern Libya.  The Latin suffix \"-ica\" can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in Celtica from Celtae, as used by Julius Caesar). The later Muslim kingdom of Ifriqiya, modern-day Tunisia, also preserved a form of the name. \n According to the Romans, Africa lay to the west of Egypt, while \"Asia\" was used to refer to Anatolia and lands to the east.

{"question": "Who was the son of Edward III and father of Henry IV?", "answers": ["john of gaunt"], "context": "BBC - History - Henry IVBBC - History - Henry IV \n z \n Henry IV     © The first of three monarchs from the house of Lancaster, Henry usurped the crown and successfully consolidated his power despite repeated uprisings. \n Henry was born in Lancashire in April 1367. His parents were cousins, his father John of Gaunt, third surviving son of Edward III, his mother descended from Henry III. In 1377 Henry's cousin, Richard II became king. In 1386, Henry joined a group of opposition leaders - the lords appellants - who outlawed Richard's closest associates and forced the king to accept their counsel. In 1398, Richard took revenge, banishing Henry after he quarrelled with another member of the court. The following year, John of Gaunt died. Richard seized the family estates, depriving Henry of his inheritance and prompting him to invade England. He met little opposition, as many were horrified by the king's actions. Richard surrendered in August and Henry was crowned in October 1399, claiming that Richard had abdicated of his own free will. \n Henry's first task was to consolidate his position. Most rebellions were quashed easily, but the revolt of the Welsh squire Owen Glendower in 1400 was more serious. In 1403, Glendower allied himself with Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, and his son Henry, called Hotspur. Hotspur's brief uprising, Henry's most serious challenge, ended when he was killed in battle with the king's forces near Shrewsbury in July 1403. \n Northumberland's subsequent rebellion in 1408 was quickly suppressed and was the last armed challenge to Henry's authority. However, he also had to fight off Scottish border raids and conflict with the French. To finance these activities, Henry was forced to rely on parliamentary grants. From 1401 to 1406 parliament repeatedly accused him of fiscal mismanagement and gradually acquired new powers over royal expenditures and appointments. \n As Henry's health deteriorated, a power struggle developed between his favourite, Thomas Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, and a faction headed by Henry's half brothers and his son, Prince Henry. From 1408 to 1411 the government was dominated first by Archbishop Arundel and then Prince Henry. Argument raged over the best strategy to adopt in France, where civil war had erupted. Prince Henry wanted to resume war in France, but the king favoured peace. Uneasy relations between the prince and his father persisted until Henry IV's death in London on 20 March 1413.  Edward III of EnglandEdward III (13 November 1312 – 21 June 1377) was King of England from 25 January 1327 until his death; he is noted for his military success and for restoring royal authority after the disastrous and unorthodox reign of his father, Edward II. Edward III transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe. His long reign of fifty years was the second longest in medieval England and saw vital developments in legislation and government—in particular the evolution of the English parliament—as well as the ravages of the Black Death. \n Edward was crowned at age fourteen after his father was deposed by his mother and her lover Roger Mortimer. At age seventeen he led a successful coup against Mortimer, the de facto ruler of the country, and began his personal reign. After a successful campaign in Scotland he declared himself rightful heir to the French throne in 1337 but his claim was denied due to the Salic law. This started what would become known as the Hundred Years' War.  Following some initial setbacks the war went exceptionally well for England; victories at Crécy and Poitiers led to the highly favourable Treaty of Brétigny. Edward's later years, however, were marked by international failure and domestic strife, largely as a result of his inactivity and poor health. \n Edward III was a temperamental man but capable of unusual clemency. He was in many ways a conventional king whose main interest was warfare. Admired in his own time and for centuries after, Edward was denounced as an irresponsible adventurer by later Whig historians such as William Stubbs. This view has been challenged recently and modern historians credit him with some significant achievements.   \n Early life \n Edward", "parametric_answer": "lionel of antwerp", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

The ancient Romans used a different calendar system , and their year began in March and ended in February! \n Even though our modern system may be quite different from the ancient Romans', they gave us something very important: the months' names. \n Let's take a look at how the ancient Romans chose the names of the 12 months of the year . \n March: The ancient Romans insisted that all wars cease during the time of celebration between the old and new years . Since March was the first month of the new year in ancient Rome, some historians believe the Romans named March after Mars , the Roman god of war . \n April: Three theories exist regarding the origin of April's name. Some say April got its name from the Latin word meaning “second\" since April was the second month on the ancient calendar . Others claim it comes from “aperire,\" a Latin word meaning “to open ,\" because it represents the opening of buds and flowers in spring . Still others think April was named after the goddess Aphrodite. \n May: May was named after Maia, an earth goddess of growing plants. \n June: Apparently, June has always been a popular month for weddings! The Romans named June after Juno, the queen of the gods and patroness of marriage and weddings. \n July: July was named after Julius Caesar in 44 B.C.

After being inspired by watching Jack Nicklaus play golf in the early seventies Faldo had his first introduction to the game, quickly achieving success in 1975 by winning both the English Amateur Championship and the British Youths Championship. \n In 1976, Faldo became a professional golfer, making his mark by finishing in eighth place on his first European tour and in 1977 he became the youngest player ever to play as part of the Ryder Cup team. During the eighties, Faldo took some time out of competition to improve his swing under the instruction of golfer turned tutor David Leadbetter. \n Following the changes made to his game, Faldo returned to competitive golf and won his first major championship title in the 1987 Open Championship. Since then, in addition to his championship success, Faldo has won a series of high profile competitions and tour events including the French Open, Irish Open, Spanish Open, the PGA, the British Masters and the European Open. He has also had several team successes including the Alfred Dunhill Cup, the World Cup and the Ryder Cup. \n Colin Montgomerie \n Affectionately known as ‘Monty,’ Colin Montgomerie is a legendary Scottish golfer and is widely recognised as the leading golfer to have emerged in European competition over the last fifteen years. Montgomerie was a successful amateur golfer, winning the Scottish Youths Championship in 1983, before turning professional in 1988 and winning the Rookie of the Year title on the European Tour that same year. \n He won his first professional title in 1989, when he won the Portugese Open and since then, he has won more European titles than any other British Golfer. During the nineties, Montgomerie went on to win numerous tournaments on the European Tour including the Scandinavian Masters in 1991, the Volvo German Open in 1995, the Murphy’s Irish Open in 1996 and 1997 and the Volvo PGA Championship in 1998. \n Between 1993 and 1999 Montgomerie won a record breaking seven ‘Order of Merit Titles’ on the tour and twenty high profile tournaments during that time, winning five titles in 1999 alone, being known as the most consistent golfer in the world during his most successful period. Since his seven year European winning streak, Montgomerie has continued to prove himself, most notably in the year 2000 when he made the record books again by winning the Volvo PGA Championship for the third time. \n In 2001 he won the Australian Masters and in 2002 he won his first Asian title in the TCL classic in China. Montgomerie has taken part in eight Ryder Cups during his career, as well as other team tournaments, including the Dunhill Cup, the World Cup and the UBS Cup. Whilst never having won a major championship title, despite coming a close second at both the US Open and the US PGA, Montgomerie is regarded as one of the finest sportsmen in Britain, officially marked in 2004 when he was awarded an OBE for sporting achievement. \n Lee Westwood \n Regarded as one of England and Europe’s finest golfers, Lee Westwood began playing golf at the age of thirteen before winning his first amateur tournament, the Pete McEvoy Trophy aged seventeen. After winning the British Youth Championship in 1993, Westwood turned professional, winning his first professional competition four years later at the Volvo Scandinavian Masters. \n Whilst Westwood has not won any major championships, he did attain fourth place in the official World Golf Rankings when he came forth in the 2000 British open. He has also won several high profile competitions, including the Freeport McDermott Classic in 1998, the Sumitomo VISA Taiheiyo Masters in 1996 and for the following two years, and the Cisco World Match Play Championship in 2000.

Not only were they once widespread across Eurasia, but there is evidence that they interbred with modern humans around 50,000 years ago. \n The new research, published in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE, once again places human evolution in Asia under the spotlight. \n Remains of at least three “red deer people” were found at Maludong – the name means “Red Deer Cave” – near the city of Mengzi in Yunnan Province in 1989. \n They were left unstudied until research began in 2008 involving scientists from six Chinese and five Australian institutions. \n A Chinese geologist discovered a fourth partial skeleton in 1979 in another cave near the village of Longlin, in the neighborring Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. \n It remained encased in a block of rock until its removal by the international team. \n Here’s some Red Deer people teeth: \n Despite containing more than half the world’s population, scientists still know little about how modern humans evolved there after settling in Eurasia some 70,000 years ago. \n Scientific attention on human origins has mostly focused on Europe and Africa. \n Until now, the only human fossils less than 100,000 years old found in mainland eastern Asia have resembled those of Homo sapiens. \n This suggested the region was devoid of human species until the arrival of modern humans. If the new fossils really do belong to a separate species, it would prove this assumption wrong. \n “The discovery of the red deer people opens the next chapter in the human evolutionary story – the Asian chapter – and it’s a story that’s just beginning to be told,” said Prof Curnoe. \n CREDIT: Peter Schouten for artist’s reconstruction of the Red Deer Cave People \n Charles Choi, LiveScience  New Type of Ancient Human Found—Descendants Live Today?New Type of Ancient Human Found—Descendants Live Today? \n New Type of Ancient Human Found—Descendants Live Today? \n Evolution's \"new twist\": Neanderthal-like \"sister group\" bred with humans like us. \n View Images \n This adult tooth is one of only two known physical remains of the Denisovan humans. \n Image courtesy David Reich, Nature \n A previously unknown kind of human—the Denisovans—likely roamed Asia for thousands of years, probably interbreeding", "parametric_answer": "denisovan", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}
{"question": "On average, a Big Mac contains 178 of what ingredient?", "answers": ["sesame", "sesame seeds", "sesame seed"], "context": "Big MacThe Big Mac is a hamburger sold by international fast food restaurant chain McDonald's. It was introduced in the metropolitan area of Pittsburgh, United States, in 1967 and nationwide in 1968. It is one of the company's signature products. \n History  \n The Big Mac was created by Jim Delligatti, an early Ray Kroc franchisee, who was operating several restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. It was invented in the kitchen of Delligatti's first McDonald's franchise, located on McKnight Road in suburban Ross Township.   \n The Big Mac had two previous names, both of which failed in the marketplace: the Aristocrat, which consumers found difficult to pronounce and understand, and Blue Ribbon Burger. The third name, Big Mac, was created by Esther Glickstein Rose, a 21-year-old advertising secretary who worked at McDonald’s corporate headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois.  \n The Big Mac debuted at Delligatti's Uniontown, Pennsylvania restaurant in 1967,  selling for 45 cents.  It was designed to compete with Big Boy restaurants' Big Boy sandwich; Eat'n Park was the Pittsburgh area's Big Boy franchisee at the time.  The Big Mac proved popular, and it was added to the menu of all U.S. restaurants in 1968. \n Product \n The Big Mac consists of two 1.6 oz (45.4 g) 100 per cent beef patties, \"special sauce\" (a variant of Thousand Island dressing), iceberg lettuce, American cheese, pickles, and onions, served in a three-part sesame seed bun.  \n The Big Mac is known worldwide and is often used as a symbol of American capitalism. The Economist has used it as a reference point for comparing the cost of living in different countries – the Big Mac Index – as it is so widely available and is comparable across markets. This index is sometimes referred to as Burgernomics. \n Special sauce  \n The name was popularized by a 1974 advertising campaign featuring a list of the ingredients in a Big Mac: \"Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions – on a sesame seed bun.\" \n Big Mac Sauce is delivered to McDonald's restaurants in sealed canisters designed by Sealright, from which it is meant to be directly dispensed using a special calibrated \"sauce gun\" that dispenses a specified amount of the sauce for each pull of the trigger. Its design is similar to a caulking gun. \n In 2012, McDonald's admitted that \"the special sauce ingredients were not really a secret\" because the recipe had been available online \"for years\". It consists of store-bought mayonnaise, sweet pickle relish and yellow mustard whisked together with vinegar, garlic powder, onion powder and paprika. \n Advertising \n The earliest instances of McDonald's utilizing advertising for the sandwich were mainly print ads, and a TV ad where Hoyt Axton sings \"The Ballad of Big Mac\" which aired in 1969. \n Two all-beef patties slogan  \n The Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions – on a sesame seed bun concept for the jingle was created by Keith Reinhard, Chairman Emeritus of DDB Worldwide, and his creative group at Needham Harper and Steers. Originally, the ingredients appeared as a one-word heading for a McDonald's ad developed for college newspapers. The words were then set to music created by Mark Vieha, who performed the original jingle. The first run of commercials ran only a year and a half, going off the air in 1976, but its popularity remained beyond its TV life. Subsequent to the jingle, McDonald's followed up with a promotion based on its customers spontaneously having a \"Big Mac Attack\". \n Many franchises in the United States ran promotions during the original campaign that awarded a free burger to customers who could recite the slogan within a specified time (usually two or three seconds). One example of its success was that the McDonald's operators in New York City ran out of Big Mac buns. McDonald's Australia emulated this promotion in the mid-1980s, and some Brazilian McDonald's around the same time (only offering a free", "parametric_answer": "calories", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

Waldheim was the fourth Secretary-General of the United Nations from 1972 to 1981, and the ninth President of Austria from 1986 to 1992. While he was running for president in Austria in 1985, the revelation of his service in Salonica as an intelligence officer in the Wehrmacht during World War II, raised international controversy. \n Early life and education \n Waldheim was born in Sankt Andrä-Wördern, a village near Vienna, on 21 December 1918.  His father was a Roman Catholic school inspector of Czech origin named Watzlawick  (original Czech spelling Václavík) who changed his name that year as the Habsburg monarchy collapsed. Waldheim served in the Austrian Army (1936–37) and attended the Vienna Consular Academy, where he graduated in 1939. Waldheim's father was active in the Christian Social Party. Waldheim himself was politically unaffiliated during these years at the Academy. Three weeks after the German annexation of Austria in 1938, Waldheim applied for membership in the National Socialist German Students' League (NSDStB), a division of the Nazi Party.  Shortly thereafter he became a registered member of the mounted corps of the SA. \n On 19 August 1944, he married Elisabeth Ritschel in Vienna; their first daughter, Lieselotte, was born the following year. A son, Gerhard, and another daughter, Christa, followed. \n Military service in World War II \n In early 1941, Waldheim was drafted into the Wehrmacht and posted to the Eastern Front where he served as a squad leader. In December of that year, he was wounded but he returned in 1942 to service. His service in the Wehrmacht from 1942 to 1945 was the subject of international review in 1985 and 1986. In his 1985 autobiography, he stated that he was discharged from further service at the front and, for the remainder of the war, finished his law degree at the University of Vienna, in addition to marrying in 1944. After publication, documents and witnesses came to light that revealed Waldheim’s military service continued until 1945, during which time he rose to the rank of Oberleutnant. \n Service in Yugoslavia and Greece \n Waldheim's functions within the staff of German Army Group E from 1942 until 1945, as determined by the International Commission of Historians,  were: \n * Interpreter and liaison officer with the 5th Alpine Division (Italy) in April/May 1942, then, \n * O2 officer (communications) with Kampfgruppe West in Bosnia in June/August 1942, \n * Interpreter with the liaison staff attached to the Italian 9th Army in Tirana in early summer 1942, \n * O1 officer in the German liaison staff with the Italian 11th Army and in the staff of the Army Group South in Greece in July/October 1943, and \n * O3 officer on the staff of Army Group E in Arksali, Kosovska Mitrovica and Sarajevo from October 1943 to January/February 1945. \n By 1943, Waldheim was serving in the capacity of an aide-de-camp in Army Group E which was headed by General Alexander Löhr.  In 1986, Waldheim said that he had served only as an interpreter and a clerk and had no knowledge either of reprisals against local Serb civilians or of massacres in neighboring provinces of Yugoslavia. He said that he had known about some of the things that had happened, and had been horrified, but could not see what else he could have done. \n Much historical interest has centered on Waldheim's role in Operation Kozara in 1942.  According to one post-war investigator, prisoners were routinely shot within only a few hundred meters (yards) of Waldheim's office,  and just 35 km}} away at the Jasenovac concentration camp.

Some of them have been in continuous use since then; others have gone out of fashion and been resurrected in the last century or two; still others only exist on lists. \n Most of these terms are listed in James Lipton's An Exaltation of Larks.

Four contestants compete each episode for the right to call themselves \"cleverdicks\" and play for a cash jackpot. As explained by host Widdecombe at the top of the first episode, a cleverdick is a person who is \"irritatingly and ostentatiously knowledgeable or intelligent.\" The question material is therefore primarily academic in nature. \n The show deliberately featured Britain's top quiz contestants (people who had won other shows). The very first show had David Stainer, one of the top quizzers in the world and champion of champions on Only Connect. He had a big score in the first round but lost to Rob Hannah (from Eggheads, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and other shows). \n In later shows Rob Hannah reached the final several times and beat several other top quiz players including Alan Gibbs (who also was in a team that won Only Connect), Nic Mortimer (the youngest contestant of the series) and Brian Pendreigh (who was in the news after Eggheads a few weeks before - which his team won). \n Gameplay \n The game is played in rounds; at the end of each round, the lowest-scoring player is eliminated. The last remaining contestant in the game plays for the money. \n Round 1 \n Each contestant has two minutes to answer a series of questions, each with five clues of decreasing difficulty. They may offer an answer after each clue, with a correct answer on the first clue being worth 5 points, and decreasing by one point with each additional clue. The contestant may also move on to the next question after any clue. The player with the fewest points in this round is eliminated. \n Round 2 \n The contestants' scores are reset to zero prior to the start of this round. As in the first round, a question is asked, and up to five clues are given. In this round, the contestants must buzz in for the right to answer. Each contestant may buzz in on each clue; the correct answer earns the points at that clue level. In addition, the contestant is given the first chance at three related bonus questions for one point each; any questions that the contestant misses is offered on the buzzers to their opponents. After eight questions, the player with the lowest score is eliminated. \n Round 3 \n Before the start of the round, the player with the higher score from round 2 is given the choice of going first or second. The contestants are asked questions in turn. With every incorrect answer, or failure to answer, a triangle is added to that contestant's side of the game board. If a contestant has at least one triangle on their side of the game board, a correct answer removes a triangle from their side. As the round progresses, a white line slowly moves down the game board; when it touches either contestant's stack of triangles, that contestant loses.

While quite a bit of mystery remains regarding this enormous and elusive fish, we have still been able to learn some interesting facts. \n Appearance \n To give you an idea of just how large they are, Greenland sharks usually grow up to 21 feet (6.5 meters), and they weigh approximately 2,000 lbs (900 kilos)! These usually sluggish sharks have very unique physical characteristics including their varying coloration, interesting fins, and dissimilar teeth. \n Cool Video Of The Greenland Shark \n Coloration \n An adult can be one or more of a few different colors. These sharks can be slate gray, purplish gray, violet, brown, or black. In addition, the sides of Greenland sharks usually have a purple tint, white spots, or dark bands. In other words these sharks can be great inspiration for designers and artists! \n Fins \n Despite the massive sizes of these sharks, they ironically have small fins. Their little dorsal fins are equal in size, situated in the middle of the shark’s trunk, and are completely spineless. The Greenland shark’s caudal fin is asymmetrical, and although they do not own anal fins, their short, wide tails aid in short acceleration bursts. \n Eyes \n Another exceedingly interesting physical attribute unique to these sharks is their eyes. The eyes are very small, and they contain Spiracles behind and above them. Unexpectedly, the majority of these sharks are blind due to the fact that they have parasites hanging from their eyes. These pinkish-white parasites are called copepods, and they attach themselves to the Greenland sharks’ cornea. \n Teeth \n Earlier I said their teeth are dissimilar; this is because their top teeth are completely different than their bottom teeth. The teeth on the top jaw are slender, pointy, and not very large. On the contrary, the bottom row of teeth are substantially larger, broader, and smoother than those on the top row. \n Diet and Hunting Behavior \n Since they hunt underneath the ice in freezing cold waters, their food searches are conducted in almost complete darkness. Due to their lack of sight caused by copepod parasites, this darkness factor doesn’t make much of a difference for these sharks. \n Sense of Smell \n Greenland sharks have an impeccable sense of smell. Therefore, they typically have no problems finding food. They slowly wander the cold ocean looking for any scent of a dead animal or carcass. \n Preferred Food Source \n These sharks particularly prefer the tastes of Narwhal and Beluga whale carcasses, and they sometimes participate in cannibalism. Furthermore, these sharks also enjoy seals, cetaceans, sea lions, salmon, lumpfish, halibut, char, capelin, herring, and other fish. \n Defense Mechanism \n Although they feed on an extensive amount of various animals, their skin is poisonous to most other animals. For example, Inuit hunters feed on these whales, however they do not feed raw shark meat to their dogs because it causes them to behave drunkenly. \n Copepod Parasites as a Hunting Aid \n Many have an interesting and plausible theory concerning the connection between Greenland sharks and copepods. It is believed that these parasites somehow lure food to the sharks; once the prey is within 3 feet (1 meter) away, the shark is then able to suck the food into its mouth by inhaling. If this is indeed true, it would make perfect sense as to why the copepods are tolerated, considering that they cause blindness to the sharks. So while it’s believed these sharks mostly eat carcasses of animals who have already died, this could possibly be a way to obtain a food source when living creatures are the only treats around. \n Habitat \n Greenland sharks inhabit freezing waters with temperatures between -2 and 7 degrees Celsius.

He has appeared in over 150 films, including The Buddy Holly Story, Lethal Weapon, Point Break, Under Siege, The Firm, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Busey also made guest appearances on shows such as Gunsmoke, Walker, Texas Ranger, Law & Order, Scrubs, and Entourage. \n In 1978, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in The Buddy Holly Story. \n The Buddy Holly Story is a 1978 biographical film which tells the life story of rock musician Buddy Holly. It features an Academy Award-winning musical score, adapted by Joe Renzetti and Oscar-nominated lead performance by Gary Busey. \n The film also stars Don Stroud, Charles Martin Smith, Conrad Janis, William Jordan, and Maria Richwine, who played Maria Elena Holly. \n It was adapted by Robert Gittler from Buddy Holly: His Life and Music, the biography of Holly by John Goldrosen, and was directed by Steve Rash. \n The actors did their own singing and played their own instruments, with guitarist Jerry Zaremba overdubbing the guitar parts. Busey, in particular, was admired by critics for recording the soundtrack music live and for losing a considerable amount of weight in order to portray the skinny Holly. According to Busey's biography, he lost 32 pounds to look more like Holly, who weighed 146 pounds at the time of his death. \n The actor's accurate portrayal was aided by knowledge gained from a previous attempt to film part of the Holly life story, the ill-fated Three-Sided Coin, in which he played Crickets drummer Jerry Allison. The film was cancelled by 20th Century Fox due to pressure from Fred Bauer and his company, who had made deals with the Holly estate. The screenplay of Three-Sided Coin (by Allison and Tom Drake) revealed many personal details about Holly, and Busey picked up more during off-set conversations with Allison. \n While the story follows Buddy Holly from age 19 to 22 (1955 to early 1959), Busey was 33 when he played the role. Charles Martin Smith auditioned for the role of Buddy, but since Busey already had been cast, the producers cast Martin to play Ray Bob Simmons because they liked his audition. Simmons and Jesse Charles were character names used in place of Joe B. Mauldin and J.I. Allison, the actual Crickets. \n The incident in which a Buffalo disc jockey locked himself in a studio and repeatedly played the same song over and over was loosely based on real-life stunts orchestrated by controversial disc jockey Tom Clay (and repeated a few years later by Danny Neaverth), who held up Buffalo's Shelton Square by playing Bill Haley & His Comets' \"Rock Around the Clock\" repeatedly from the top of a billboard, and by Joey Reynolds, who locked himself in a studio playing \"Sherry\" by The Four Seasons\" for several hours; those incidents, however, had no relation to Buddy Holly or his music. \n The film won the Academy Award for Best Adaptation Score by Joe Renzetti. Busey was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and Tex Rudloff, Joel Fein, Curly Thirlwell and Willie D.

He played farmer Phil Archer for 59 years \n He was the patriarch of the fictional farming village of Ambridge, and his most famous storyline was on September 22, 1955 when his wife Grace was killed trying to rescue a horse from a burning barn. \n The episode was scheduled to coincide with the launch of ITV. \n Painting, who also wrote 1,200 Archers scripts, only made rare appearances over the past year as he suffered from ill health. \n RELATED ARTICLES \n Fans will be able to hear his last episode on Sunday, November 22. \n Tributes have been pouring in to the much-loved actor. \n Last night Archers editor Vanessa Whitburn called Painting 'the consummate professional' and said: 'Phil graduated seamlessly from young romantic hero to serious farmer and father.' \n BBC Director-General Mark Thompson described him as 'a gifted writer and talented versatile broadcaster.' \n 'He was a pillar of The Archers family, but to millions of listeners he became a friend and latterly a wonderful father figure. \n 'His death leaves us with a great sense of loss but an even deeper feeling of gratitude for such a huge contribution to the BBC and its audiences over six decades,' he said. \n Norman's death comes on the day that Radio 4 announced record figures for The Archers.

The fact that the opponents were pushovers was offset by a whiskey company's million-dollar challenge to anyone who could hit six sixes in an over. The company in question, Johnnie Walker, apparently encouraged the players in the tournament to \"know their boundaries\". \n In a colourful career that had had match-fixing scandals, racism charges, \"dropping\" the 1999 World Cup, and dope-smoking, Gibbs had certainly crossed many more boundaries than the sixes he hit in that over. \n They weren't miscues by any stretch of the imagination, but they weren't conventional shots either. Smears over long-off, long-on and midwicket, it was arguably some of the most reckless driving ever seen on a cricket pitch. \n \"If the ball presents itself, I'll try everything,\" Gibbs said later. \"I was lucky the straight boundaries were quite small but the six sixes was a bonus, it was just nice to get a hit in the middle. The message came out that Jacques Kallis and I could have a dip, and we probably had a bigger dip than was needed. After the fourth one, I thought it could be on. I thought about using my feet and coming down the pitch, but then I changed my mind and decided to stay in the crease. The idea was for me to have another two goes at it [the record] and luckily I didn't miscue any of them, so it was quite nice.\" \n It was thrilling and ferocious stuff, and the only pity is that barely 1000 spectators were in the ground to witness it. \n © ESPN Sports Media Ltd.

Guests included Tom Hanks, Eric Idle, Sheryl Crow, Richard and Lauren Donner, David Foster, Rita Hanks, Tom Petty, and many others. \n 1750 Vine Street on April 14, 2009. \n BIOGRAPHY \n George Harrison was born on February 25, 1943 in Liverpool. After a stint playing with his group the Rebels, George, together with his schoolmate Paul McCartney, joined John Lennon's Quarrymen. He was fifteen at the time, and the stage was set for The Beatles to emerge as the best possible news in post-War Britain. \n Over the course of The Beatles' career, Harrison played the role of guitarist, singer and songwriter. His contributions to The Beatles' catalogue include I Need You, Taxman, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Something and Here Comes the Sun, to name only a few. His lifelong interest in Indian culture advanced considerably through his friendship with Ravi Shankar and affected all of The Beatles and their musical explorations. \n In the years immediately following the break-up of The Beatles, George released his first solo album All Things Must Pass to worldwide acclaim, followed by further major recordings, the bulk of which went gold or platinum. One could argue that The Concert for Bangladesh, featuring George's friends Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Ravi Shankar, Leon Russell, Ringo Starr, and others, has had the greatest impact. As a response to a world crisis, it was like nothing that the music business had witnessed up to that point and earned a Grammy for Album of the Year in 1973. \n In 1987 on the heels of George's top ten album Cloud Nine he formed the Traveling Wilburys with Bob Dylan, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison and Tom Petty. Handle with Care was the Wilburys' first single and it caught the world by surprise. The Wilburys would go on to earn a Grammy and are still remembered as the \"supergroup\" with no equal. \n After a life of excursions in the arts and spiritual adventures, George Harrison passed away in 2001. The following year, A Concert for George was organized by Eric Clapton and Olivia Harrison. Filmed at The Royal Albert Hall his former bandmates Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne created a magical night. The event captured something of the warm and intense impact George had on those fortunate enough to know him well. \n His songwriting was powerful enough to generate standards in the field.

{"question": "In the British Army, which commissioned rank is indicated by a crown on each shoulder?", "answers": ["major"], "context": "Rank Insignia Of The British Army, 1914-1918Rank Insignia Of The British Army, 1914-1918 \n Rank Insignia Of The British Army, 1914-1918 \n Weapons, Equipment and Uniforms \n Email \n Officers \n In the 17th and 18th centuries, British officers' ranks were denoted          by the amount of lace or other decoration on the dress, and although the          crossed sword and baton device of general officers was already in use          in 1800, the different grades of general were only distinguished by the          grouping of the buttons on their coats until the Crimean War. Badges for          field officers (using crowns and stars) were first introduced in 1810,          and for captains and subaltern officers in 1855. The badges were then          worn on the collar, but were moved to the shoulder cords in 1880 for all          officers in full dress, when the system of crowns and stars was reorganised.          Captains and below had one fewer star from 1880 until 1902 but otherwise,          with one exception, the rank badges introduced in 1880 have remained unchanged          to the present day. In addition to the shoulder badges, officers' ranks          were also reflected in the amount and pattern of gold lace worn on the          cuffs of the full-dress tunic. \n General officers: \n Field Marshal: Two crossed batons in a wreath, crown above \n General: Crossed sword and baton, crown and star above \n Lieutenant-General: Crossed sword and baton, crown above \n Major-General: Crossed sword and baton, star above \n Brigadier-General: Crossed sword and baton \n Field officers: \n Colonel: Crown above two stars \n Lieutenant-Colonel: Crown above one star \n Major: Crown \n Lieutenant: Two stars \n Second Lieutenant: One star \n The rank of brigadier-general (actually a temporary appointment conferred          on colonels) was replaced in 1920 by that of colonel commandant, renamed          brigadier in 1928, and his badge then became a crown over three stars. \n The crown was the so-called King's or Imperial pattern, the arches not          being dipped in the centre as is the case today with the Queen's pattern          crown. The star or 'pip' is that of the Order of the Bath, except that          certain regiments -notably the Guards - wore the stars of the Garter or          other orders. All officers' badges on service dress were of gilding metal,          except for Rifle regiments and the Royal Army Chaplain's Department which          used bronze instead. The illustrations above show the insignia of Lieutenant-General,          Colonel, Captain and Second Lieutenant. \n When service dress was introduced in 1902, a complex system of markings          with bars and loops in thin drab braid above the cuff - known irreverently          as the asparagus bed - was used at first, but this was replaced in the          same year by a combination of narrow rings of worsted braid around the          cuff, with the full-dress style shoulder badges on a three-pointed cuff          flap. To correspond with the equivalent naval ranks, colonels had four          rings of braid, lieutenant-colonels and majors three, captains two and          subalterns one. In the case of Scottish regiments, the rings were around          the top of the gauntlet-style cuff and the badges on the cuff itself.          General officers still wore their badges on the shoulder strap. \n During the Great War, some officers took to wearing similar jackets to          the men, with the rank badges on the shoulder, as the cuff badges made          them too conspicuous to snipers. This practice was frowned on outside          the trenches but was given official sanction in 1917 as an optional alternative,          being made permanent in 1920, when the cuff badges were abolished. \n Non-Commissioned Officers \n The familiar chevrons worn by sergeants and corporals date back to          1802. As today, sergeants wore three chevrons, point downwards, on the          upper arm, and corporals wore two, with sergeant-majors and quarter-master-sergeants          then having four.

It’s my turn.” \n His turn comes after boss Stuart Lancaster opted for the untried ­combination of ­ Billy ­Twelvetrees and Tomkins, 26, in midfield. \n It is a day out the Tomkins clan could not possibly have envisaged as recently as two years ago, when Joel was still playing league for Wigan Warriors. \n “As a kid growing up in Wigan there’s no sport other than rugby league,” he said. “You don’t even really know rugby union is played. All you want to do is play for Wigan. \n \"On Friday nights when Wigan are at home, the whole town stops and everyone goes to the game. There are no other distractions, really. No one wants to be a footballer, everyone just wants to play rugby.” \n Then came a month in late 2011 when everything changed. \n Joel was lured to Saracens and, days later, Sam accepted a one-off invitation to play union for the ­Barbarians select XV against Australia. \n “As you get a bit older, your skills become more transferable to union,” Joel explained. “I decided I wanted to play ­international rugby and I wanted to play at Twickenham.” \n Two years on, he regards himself as, instinctively, a union player - albeit one operating in the Little Wigan environment that England’s rugby union squad has become since Jason Robinson blazed his cross-code trail. \n Besides coach and Warriors legend Andy Farrell, there is his fly-half son Owen and winger Chris Ashton. \n All hail from Wigan. \n Ashton and Tomkins were in the same class at school before coming off Wigan’s production line together. \n “I would never say either sport is tougher,” said Tomkins. “They’re completely different and tough in different ways. \n “In league, it’s all about upper body. The collision is big, then you try to hold them up before taking them slowly to ground. In union, you try to get them on the ground as quickly as possible.” \n Some see Tomkins as a stop-gap until Manu Tuilagi is fit.

When we think of the greatest fighters of all time, the names Ali, Tyson and Mayweather instantly come to mind. During the nineties, Britain experienced a modern golden era thanks to Naseem Hamed, Chris Eubank and Nigel Benn. And today, despite boxing's relative decline, the likes of Anthony Joshua, Kell Brook and Amir Khan are still known to most sports fans. \n But, as recently as 1948, the most prestigious titles in British boxing were off limits to non-white competitors. 68 years ago this week, Dick Turpin – a mixed-race fighter from the Midlands – broke down the colour barrier. \n Dick was born in November 1920, the eldest the son of Lionel Turpin – a West Indian who had stowed away to Britain to join the army during World War I – and his wife Beatrice (née Whitehouse). Dick's father was black and his mother white during a time before significant ethnic diversity in Britain. What's more, the Turpin family did not live in a large city where racial mixing would have been more (albeit not hugely) common, but in the Warwickshire town of Leamington Spa. \n Lionel died in 1929; he had fought at the Battle of the Somme, never fully recovering from the injuries he sustained in a gas attack. Beatrice was thus left to raise the children alone. \n Perhaps because of these challenging circumstance, Dick and his two younger brothers, Jack and Randolph, all took up boxing during childhood. Dick and Randolph were both middleweights, while Jack fought at featherweight. \n Dick made his professional debut as an 18-year-old against Jimmy Griffiths in March 1939, eventually losing on points (he subsequently won a rematch). Like his father, he would also serve in the forces, refusing an exemption in order to fight on the African, Italian and German fronts during World War II. \n He returned unharmed and resumed his career in the ring. Almost a decade after his debut he would become British champion, beating Vince Hawkins on points after a 15-round bout at Villa Park stadium in Birmingham. \n Turpin training in 1949, the year after he became British champion \n That saw Turpin earn a very noteworthy distinction: he was the first non-white fighter to be crowned British champion in any weight division. But this was not because of a dearth of non-white competitors, nor a lack of quality – in fact, Dick already held the Empire title. Rather, a bar existed in British boxing that prevented any fighter \"of coloured skin\" from competing for the belt. \n Incredibly, this was not a hangover from the 18th or 19th century that survived into ostensibly more enlightened times. It was introduced relatively late, in 1911, amid anxieties over the fitness of the \"white race\", and concerns over how a \"coloured\" fighter defeating a white opponent would affect the colonies. \n Of course, non-white boxers were abundant and highly skilled in the early 20th century. The most famous was American fighter Jack Johnson, who became heavyweight champion of the world in 1908 and subsequently defended his title several times. \n But Johnson was unpopular with many white Americans, not least those in power, and received almost equal contempt in Britain. Johnson was very much his own man, one who refused to bow to the expectations placed on him by the white ruling classes. His success made him a global star. In 1911, he was set to fight Britain's 'Bombardier' Billy Wells in London. \n But there was a considerable backlash to the prospect of a white man facing a black opponent on British soil. Home Secretary Winston Churchill was lobbied by many – including the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Lonsdale – to step in and stop the fight from happening.

The family moved to London in 1967, when Albert and his brother Michel Roux opened Le Gavroche. Roux Jr. was subsequently educated at the private Emanuel School in Battersea, south-west London \n Apprenticeship and training \n After leaving school at age 16, Roux undertook apprenticeship work with Master Patissier, Hellegouarche in Paris. From summer 1979 through January 1980, he worked as a commis de cuisine at Le Gavroche, under both his father and his uncle. He then spent two years as a commis de cuisine trainee under Alain Chapel at his hotel and restaurant in Mionnay, in the Rhône-Alpes region near Lyon. \n After undertaking basic training with the French Army, from February 1982 to March 1983 he served his military service at the Elysee Palace, working for both Presidents Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and François Mitterrand. Having finished his military service, Roux then worked for four months in Paris: two months at Charcuterie Gérard Mothu in St-Mandé; and then two months at Boucherie Lamartine on the Avenue Victor-Hugo. \n Returning to London, in August 1983 he learned accountancy at Finlay Robertson, before becoming the Sous Chef at Gavvers. He then took the opportunity to work with renowned chef Pierre Koffman at his Chelsea restaurant La Tante Claire, reverting to the rank of Commis Chef to do so. From October to December 1983, he worked at the Mandarin Hotel, Hong Kong. \n Career \n Having served his apprenticeship and training mainly away from the Roux brothers' British business empire, he joined his uncle at the Waterside Inn, in Bray, Berkshire in 1985, before working with his father at Le Gavroche from the April of the same year. He then worked in and managed the Roux brothers catering business for three years, before returning to Le Gavroche in 1990, the year the two brothers split their business down family lines. When his father retired in 1993, Michel Jr took over the world famous restaurant. \n A food consultant to the Walbrook club since 2003, he also consults for the fine dining providers Restaurant Associates.

In 2012 he appeared as a guest judge on Masterchef South Africa. From 2013 until 2014, Roux co-presented BBC Two's Food and Drink alongside Kate Goodman. In 2013 he appeared as one of the mentors in the series The Chef's Protege. \n In March 2014 Roux announced that he was leaving the BBC due to a conflict over his brand ambassadorship for Albert Bartlett Rooster potatoes.   \n In 2015, Roux returned to television and presented First Class Chefs for the Disney Channel and Kitchen Impossible with Michel Roux Jr for Channel 4. \n Personal life \n Roux is married to French-national Giselle, who has worked in the restaurant business for years and is currently the secretary at Le Gavroche. The couple have a daughter, Emily, who is training to be a chef. The family lives in London.  \n A lover of alcohol, Roux does not drink between Monday and Friday,  but enjoys Krug champagne at the weekend.  Roux is a big rugby fan and is an honorary member of Harlequins and goes to most matches.  He also likes Manchester United,  and is a keen marathon runner, having run the London marathon twelve times to raise funds for the children's charity VICTA (Visually Impaired Children Taking Action).

The most fuel-efficient Agila was the 1.0-litre petrol ecoFLEX model, which returned 69mpg and emitted 109g/km CO2, for a £20 annual road-tax bill. Whichever engine you specified, the Agila couldn’t manage CO2 emissions of less than 100g/km, meaning there were no road-tax-exempt models. If you chose an automatic gearbox, the Agila’s economy dropped to 49.6mpg, while its CO2 emissions rose to 131g/km, leaving you liable for a £130 tax bill – not hugely impressive for a car of this size. \n Engines, drive & performance \n 2.4 / 5 \n The Vauxhall Agila was best suited to city driving \n The Agila was primarily a city car and its small size and light weight, coupled with accurate steering and good grip, meant it was enjoyable to drive around town and parking was easy. The 93bhp 1.2-litre petrol engine provided the best performance, while the 1.0-litre had a characterful sound but not enough power – something particularly felt on motorways. \n Interior & comfort \n 2.1 / 5 \n The Vauxhall Agila felt spacious inside, and its suspension was comfortable \n While it was a small car, the fact that the Agila had a high roof meant it felt light and airy inside and adults in the back weren’t too squashed – provided they were only there for short trips. The Agila’s suspension was good at soaking up bumpier city streets and it felt relatively smooth and comfortable on the motorway. While the engines were quiet and powerful enough around town, they needed to be worked hard at speed. This meant the Agila could be noisy on longer journeys. \n Practicality & boot space \n 2.9 / 5 \n The Vauxhall Agila’s four doors and good boot space made it a practical car \n For a car of its size, the Agila was reasonably practical. While it wasn’t designed as a family car, four adults could sit inside in relative comfort and it had practical interior, with plenty of storage spaces and deep door pockets. As it was only available as a four-door, getting in and out of the Agila was easy, and the high roof also helped. While a 225-litre boot sounds small, it’s actually quite generous for a city car size and the Agila’s standard 60:40 split-folding rear seats increased boot space to an impressive 1,050 litres when folded. \n Reliability & safety \n 3.4 / 5 \n Because it was built with Suzuki, the Vauxhall Agila should be reliable \n While it was on sale, the Vauxhall Agila fared well in our annual Driver Power customer satisfaction survey, coming 41st out of 150 cars in the 2013 poll. Its seventh-place finish for reliability and number-one spot for running costs meant Agila owners clearly rated their cars as being cheap to run and dependable. The Agila also benefits from being based on the Suzuki Splash , as the Japanese brand has an excellent reputation for reliability means. \n While the Vauxhall Agila was never put through Euro NCAP crash-testing, its sister car the Splash scored four out of five stars, meaning it was reasonably rather than exceptionally safe. Many cars in this class managed the full five stars and the Splash was let down partly by the lack of standard electronic stability control – optional on the Agila, too. \n Price, value for money & options \n 3.5 / 5 \n The cheapest Vauxhall Agilas were sparsely equipped \n The Agila was the smallest car Vauxhall made at the time, so its standard equipment list was quite short. The entry-level Expression came with a 12v power socket and a CD player, but that was about it.

It is located at the confluence of the Moselle and the Seille. \n Although historically Nancy was the capital of the duchy of Lorraine and later the French province of Lorraine, it was Metz which was chosen as the capital of the newly created région of Lorraine in the middle of the 20th century. \n In ancient times Metz, then known as Divodurum (the town at the holy mountain), was the capital of the Celtic Mediomatrici, and the name of this tribe, contracted into Mettis, formed the origin of the present name. \n The administrative capital of Lorraine, the seat of the regional institutions, and a traditional centre of exchanges conducive to trade, Metz with the 200,000 people who live in the city and its suburbs, is today seeing a logical development in the service area. \n Links to Metz  Lorraine region - About-FranceLorraine - regional information and tourist attractions. \n Lorraine \n Located in the northeast of France, \n on the borders of Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany, Lorraine is one of the old historic provinces of France and Europe, established in the ninth century as the land of Lothair, grandson of the emperor Charlmagne. \n  Lorraine regional guide and tourist attractions \n Page index \n Hotels in Lorraine \n   Lorraine was not always part of France. When, in the 9th century, Charlemagne divided his empire into three parts, Lorraine, like today's Luxembourg, Holland and Belgium, was part of the middle Empire, between France in the west and Germany in the east. This middle section of the Carolingian empire was bequeathed to Charlemagne's grandson Lothair, and was thus known as Lotharingia, which has given the modern name Lorraine. \n     Lorraine has always been on the dividing line between the French speaking lands of the west and the German-speaking lands of the east. In bygone centuries, Germanic tongues were spoken in much of the region, as is witnessed by the many Germanic place names in the region, such as Metz, Forbach, or Freyming-Merlebach. The north of the region borders on the Saar region of Germany, and on Luxembourg. French has nevertheless been the main language for many centuries. \n      Joan of Arc, or as the French call her Jeanne d'Arc, is doubtless the most famous child of Lorraine, and her birthplace can be visited in the village of Domrï¿½my-la-Pucelle, in the Vosges department. \n     The Lorraine region consists of four departments, Meurthe-et-Moselle (54), Meuse (55), Moselle (57), and Vosges (88). It is the only French region to border on three different foreign countries – Belgium, Luxembourg, and Germany: it also borders on three other French regions, Alsace to the east, Champagne-Ardenne to the west, and Franche-Comtï¿½ to the south. \n     Until the late twentieth century, Lorraine was known as an industrial region, part of a large European industrial heartland stretching over north-east France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the west of Germany. The region was home to a lot of heavy industry, notably coal, iron and steel, concentrated in particular in the departments of Meurthe et Moselle and Moselle. Cities such as Pont-ï¿½-Mousson, Thionville or Forbach were major centres in the industrial age. With the decline of rustbelt industries in France, Lorraine went through major economic and social upheavals.

{"question": "Which popular newsreader resigned from ITN in 1979?", "answers": ["reginald bosanquet"], "context": "ITNIndependent Television News (ITN) is a British-based news and content provider.  It is made up of three divisions: ITN News, ITN Source and ITN Productions.  ITN is based in London, with bureaux and offices in Beijing, Brussels, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, New York, Paris, Sydney and Washington DC. \n ITN produces content for ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, UK mobile phone operators, online outlets such as YouTube, MSN, Telegraph Media Group, Yahoo!, and film producers and researchers worldwide. \n Between 1955 and 1999, ITN was more commonly known as the general brand name of ITV's news programmes. Since 1999, ITN is no longer used as the brand name; however, the company still produces all ITV News programmes. \n History \n ITN was founded in January 1955 by the Independent Television Authority, as part of the new British commercial television network referred to as \"Independent Television\" (later ITV). \n It began as a consortium of the initial ITV broadcasting companies, with former Labour MP Aidan Crawley as editor-in-chief. One of those companies, the London weekday contract-holder Associated-Rediffusion offered the new company studio space in its headquarters in Aldwych, London. The first bulletin was broadcast at 10pm on 22 September 1955 on ITV's launch night. The bulletin was presented by former champion athlete Christopher Chataway. From the start, ITN broke new ground by introducing in-vision newscasters and reporter packages. The unique, probing reporting style of Robin Day caused shock among politicians, finding themselves questioned continually for information – this had never been the case with the BBC. There was also some early tensions with the ITV companies. ABC Television, the ITV contractor for the north on weekends and Midlands on weekdays immediately called for shorter ITN bulletins. While the ITA ruled on a minimum of a 20-minute bulletin, disagreements with the ITV companies over ITN's budget triggered the resignation of its news editor Aidan Crawley after just one year in 1956. He was replaced by Geoffrey Cox.  \n Throughout the early years, ITN continued to develop its service to the ITV network with an agenda to firstly, fulfil its public service broadcasting requirements and secondly satisfy the ITV companies by attracting viewers. Under this method ITN continued to differentiate from the BBC by conducting probing interviews, more human interest stories, bringing ordinary people on to screen by using vox pops, all of which were seen as a radical departure at the time in British media. As ITV expanded, each ITV company that made up the network's federal structure had to purchase a stake in ITN and to continue to finance the company. \n In 1967, ITN was given the go ahead by the ITA to provide a full 30 minute daily news programme at 10pm on ITV. There was further tension with the ITV executives as they were sceptical of the idea that viewers would not want a full 30 minutes of news every Monday to Friday and they were also losing valuable peak time slots which could be used for commercial activity. News at Ten began broadcasting on 3 July 1967 with a newscaster team consisting of Alastair Burnet, Andrew Gardner, George Ffitch and Reginald Bosanquet. It was initially given a 13-week trial run, however, the programme proved to be extremely popular with viewers and continued for a further 32 years. News at Ten was to become one of the most prestigious and iconic news programmes of its time in British history with a reputation for high quality journalism and innovation. ITN's News at Ten also prompted the BBC to establish a fixed nightly news bulletin at 9pm. The Nine O'Clock News began broadcasting in 1970 as News at Ten's rival. ITN also established other programmes in the ITV schedule. First Report, a lunchtime bulletin began in 1972 and by 1976, News at 5.45 commenced. This was a period when ITN enjoyed its greatest plaudits, following Lord Annan's 1977 report on the future of broadcasting, which declared: \"We subscribe to the generally held view that ITN has the edge over BBC news.\"  \n ITN commenced producing Channel 4 News when the channel started broadcasting in 1982.

He proved to be a natural: After becoming the youngest golfer ever to win a British amateur title, he turned professional just four years later at the age of 19. In 1977, at age 21, he became the youngest man ever to make a Ryder Cup team. \n Faldo had success on the European tour in the early 1980s, but his failure to win a major championship frustrated him, and in 1983, he hired instructor David Leadbetter to help him redesign his swing. It paid off, as Faldo won the British Open for the first time in 1987 at Muirfield by one stroke over Paul Azinger and Rodger Davis. In 1989 and 1990 he won back-to-back Masters, both in sudden-death playoffs. He followed his second Masters victory by trouncing the field to win his second British Open, this time by five strokes at the venerable St. Andrews course. By this time, Faldo was at the top of his game and was the highest ranked golfer in the world. \n At the 1992 British Open, Faldo began the last day with a four-shot lead over Cook and Corey Pate, stretching the lead to five shots on the first nine holes. On the back nine, though, it looked like Faldo might live up to the old nickname given to him by British tabloids in the early 1980s–“Nick Foldo.” While Faldo faltered with bogeys on the 11th, 13th and 14th holes, Cook, playing ahead of Faldo, birdied the 14th, 15th and 16th holes and took the lead. After Faldo managed to birdie 15, Cook’s drive on 17 left him with a 30-foot putt for eagle and a four-stroke lead. He missed by centimeters, skimming the lip of the cup, which left him with an easy two-footer for birdie. Unbelievably, he missed again, leaving the door open for Faldo. Faldo saved a par on 16, birdied 17 and hit a drive on 18 to put himself within 20 feet of the hole. The steely-nerved Faldo hit a soft putt to within a foot of the hole, and then putted in for a two-stroke win and the championship. \n Faldo beat Greg Norman by five strokes to win his third Masters and sixth major overall in 1996. \n More on This Topic  Nick FaldoSir Nicholas Alexander Faldo MBE (born 18 July 1957) is an English professional golfer on the European Tour, now mainly an on-air golf analyst. A top player of his era, renowned for his single-minded dedication to the game,  he was ranked No. 1 on the Official World Golf Ranking for a total of 97 weeks.  His 40 professional wins include 30 victories on the European Tour and six major championships: three Open Championships (1987, 1990, 1992) and three Masters (1989, 1990, 1996). \n Faldo has since become a television pundit for major golf championships. In 2006, he became the lead golf analyst for CBS Sports. In 2012, Faldo joined the BBC Sport on-air team for coverage of the Open Championship. \n Playing career \n Early years \n Born in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, England, Faldo \"became hooked\" on golf at the age of 14—having never \"even picked up a golf club\" himself, watching Jack Nicklaus play the 1971 Masters on his parent's \"new colour\" television (his very first exposure to the game).

{"question": "Who was British Prime Minister at the end of the Second World War?", "answers": ["clement attlee", "attlee"], "context": "Who was the British Prime Minister during World War II ...Who was the British Prime Minister during World War II? | Reference.com \n Who was the British Prime Minister during World War II? \n A: \n Quick Answer \n At the outbreak of World War II, which was sparked by the 1939 German invasion of Poland, Neville Chamberlain was the prime minister of the United Kingdom; he was succeeded by Winston Churchill in 1940, who remained prime minister until July 1945. Clement Attlee replaced Churchill as prime minister in July 1945 and, although the war was technically still ongoing at that point, Attlee is not considered to be a wartime prime minister. The United Kingdom had suspended elections during the war, and elections were not held again until Germany had surrendered. \n Full Answer \n At the end of Churchill's tenure as prime minister, Germany had surrendered, in May 1945, but Japan had not. Japan did not surrender until September 1945, and the United States took the majority of the responsibility for ensuring Japanese surrender. Churchill served as prime minister during the signing of the major treaties and the convening of major international conferences, although he was technically not prime minister at the very end of the war. With Europe relatively stable in the aftermath of the German and Italian surrender, the U.K. began to return to normal political life, which included the election of a new prime minister. Although Churchill was defeated by Attlee in 1945, he became prime minister again in 1951 and served until 1955.  Prime Ministers in the First World War | History of governmentPrime Ministers in the First World War | History of government \n Prime Ministers in the First World War \n Public image: Winston Churchill,1916, with the Royal Scots Fusiliers at Ploegsteert on the French-Belgian border. \n   \n The centenary year of the outbreak of the First World War has encouraged a variety of reflections. To previous generations, the role played by their prime ministers would have been amongst the first items worthy of comment. In a less hierarchical age priorities have changed: but prime ministerial responses to the Great War are, in fact, crucial to how we remember today in some quite unexpected ways. \n 'Great War generation' \n For each of the 23 years between May 1940 and October 1963 men who had fought in the First World War held the office of Prime Minister. By contrast, Second World War veterans held the office for a mere seven years. Four British Prime Ministers saw active service in the Great War: Winston Churchill, Clement Attlee , Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan . Churchill’s road to the front was unique: he began the War in the Cabinet; after he resigned in the wake of the disastrous Gallipoli campaign, he wangled his way into the command of a battalion of the Royal Scots Fusiliers in 1916; he returned to senior political office in 1917. \n Attlee, Macmillan and Eden were part of the more conventional ‘Great War generation’, men on who fell the burden of frontline fighting. All three volunteered. All three served as infantry officers, Attlee with the East Lancashire Regiment, Eden with the King’s Royal Rifle Corps, and Harold Macmillan with the Grenadier Guards. \n War would later force the four men to work together. In May 1940 Churchill formed his wartime coalition government: Attlee entered the War Cabinet and, in February 1942, became Deputy Prime Minister. Eden became Foreign Secretary in December 1940. Macmillan entered the Cabinet as British Minister Resident in the Mediterranean at the end of 1942. Their co-habitation lasted until Attlee broke up the coalition following the defeat of Germany in May 1945. \n The Great War prime ministers do not appear, at first sight, to have formed any cohesive identity. Most obviously they adhered to different political parties. The Great War bound its prime ministers together primarily in their rejection of attempts to capsize British politics and society. Attlee wrote in the 1930s that war was the ‘one overwhelming issue which may affect a union of people who differ widely in their conceptions of society but are united in the resolve to defend the particular society to which they belong.’ \n Strengthened faith in Britain \n They were the ‘regulars", "parametric_answer": "winston churchill", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

One of those men would be hailed as the inventor of the Frisbee. The other would die unknown, just as he began to fight for a share of the credit and millions in royalties the Frisbee generated. The First to Fly Walter Frederick Morrison came to Warren Franscioni in 1947, looking for work. Both men had been Army Air Corps pilots in World War II. Maj. Franscioni served with the Air Transport Service in India and China; Lt. Morrison flew a fighter in 58 missions over Italy before being shot down and held in Stalag 13, Germany's infamous prison camp. Franscioni's parents lived in Paso Robles, where his father had been mayor, so he settled after the war in San Luis Obispo. He founded a butane company as his father had done in Paso. He built a home on Conejo Avenue, in a neighborhood developing near San Luis High School, and he opened the Franscioni and Davis Butane Co. office at 884 Broad St., across Broad from Mission College Prep. \"I first met Fred Morrison in late 1947,\" Franscioni wrote in a 1973 letter. \"He was a struggling World War II veteran trying to build a home for his family at Baywood Park, a developing residential area just outside San Luis Obispo, California. \"At that time, I was attempting to establish a bottle gas business with a partner, George Davis, in San Luis Obispo. We needed someone to assist in the installation of home heating appliances, and Fred went to work for us.\" The bottled gas business moved too slowly in postwar SLO to sustain three men and their families. So Franscioni and Morrison dreamed up an enterprise on the side. For decades kids had played catch with metal pie tins. The sport grew in popularity during the Depression, and soldiers spread it across the country during the war. The game had a few drawbacks. The tins made a shrill noise, and if you didn't catch them just right, they stung. After a few crash landings they could crack or develop sharp edges that cut fingers. Morrison and Franscioni thought of casting them in plastic, a material proliferated by wartime industry. Morrison took credit for the idea in later interviews, but Franscioni said they thought of it together. \"I do know that when we compared some of our past experiences at sailing things, it came out plastics,\" Franscioni wrote.   It seems like a simple idea today, but Morrison and Franscioni broke new ground. And after 49 years of improvements, the Frisbee has diverged little from their first plastic interpretation of a pie tin. \"People were throwing paint can lids and paper plates and pie pans throughout history, since they were invented,\" said Victor Malafronte, a Frisbee historian in Alameda. \"The first plastic disc was that Flyin' Saucer in 1948.\" Morrison and Franscioni used a lathe to carve their first model out of Tenite, a hard cellulose material now used in toothbrush handles and eyeglass frames. That disc confirmed the aerodynamics of the toy, but it shattered on landing. \"I tackled the job of working up a design that would transform the pie-tin shape into what we believed would", "parametric_answer": "skateboard", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}
{"question": "Dao is a region of wine production in which country?", "answers": ["portugal"], "context": "Dao wine region - Wine SearcherDao Wine Region \n Dao \n Dao Wine \n Dão is one of Portugal's most prominent wine regions, located just south of the famous Douro Valley. It has suffered from a bad reputation in the past but international wine media attention and improvements in production (and marketing) have helped the region to start shining. The top Dão wines are now some of the most highly rated in Europe, winning consistent praise on both sides of the Atlantic. \n The Dão viticultural region is in the north of the country. It takes its name from the Dão river, along which the majority of the region's vineyards are located. The Dão is a tributary of the larger Mondego (Portugal's longest river) and several other rivers also flow through the region. However, only the Dão is significant enough to have the local DOC named after it – mostly due to the tough, crystalline granite that the river has carved its path through for many millennia. \n Roses in the vineyards keep watch for mildew \n ©Wines of Portugal \n To the north, south and east of the Dão Valley are the granite mountains of eastern Beiras. These are the same peaks which separate Beira Litoral (coastal Beira) from Beira Interior (inland Beira), and the Dão and Douro rivers. As a result of this protected position, the climate along the Dão is relatively mild, stable and consistent between vineyard sites. Naturally, this creates a homogenization of the region's terroir; whether this is a bad or good thing is open to debate. \n The majority of Dão's quality vineyards are situated at altitudes between 500-1500ft (150–450m) above sea level. This elevation raises the vines out of the valley's shadows and towards all-important sunshine, allowing them to maximize their photosynthesis time during the day. It also increases diurnal temperature variation , helping the grapes cool down at night, which they must do to retain the acids so desirable in wine. \n The biggest name in Dão wine production is Sogrape, the first wine company off the mark after Dão's restrictive wine laws were lifted at the time of the 1989 vintage. Sogrape also happens to be the largest Portuguese wine producer, having firmly established itself in the second half of the 20th century through the remarkable success of its Mateus rosé wine. The company invested heavily in the Dão area, most obviously at the Quinta dos Carvalhais (The Oaks Estate), which now processes several million liters of wine each vintage. The quinta ('farm' or 'estate') has only a modest acreage under vine and much of its wine is made from grapes bought in from the surrounding area, much like the old system created under the Salazar regime. \n Arguably, the finest red wines from Dão today are deep reds made from Tinta Roriz and Touriga Nacional , two of the key grapes used to make port wines. Jaen and Alfrocheiro Preto are two other common red wine grapes here, along with large quantities of lesser grapes such as the memorably entitled Bastardo and the Baga that dominates plantings in Bairrada to the west. White wines are also produced in Dão, with the finest examples based on Encruzado , the region's most widely planted light-skinned grape variety. \n Last updated 03-Jul-2016  Best Wine Regions In Portugal for Wine Tourism - Dão and ...Best Wine Regions In Portugal for Wine Tourism - Dão and Lafões \n Dão and Lafões \n Azores \n Dão and Lafões \n The region of Dão and Lafões has wonderful places, framed by mountains as Caramulo or Gralheira/Montemuro, and rivers as Dão and Paiva. \n Useful Information \n Dão-Lafões is placed in a territory of the Centre Region, between the coast and the hinterland of the country, it has a rich ancient heritage, ranging from prehistory until today, with both roman and medieval traces. \n In the middle ages, the vineyard was essentially developed by the clergy.

Rather, pearl is a composite of the mineral Aragonite (Calcium Carbonate) and the organic compound conchiolin (a protein). The   combination is called nacre, or mother-of-pearl. In some cases, there is an   admixture of the mineral calcite (another mineral composed of Calcium Carbonate). In pearl   oysters and freshwater pearl mussels, nacre forms the inner lining of the   shell. In most other molluscs the shell has an appearance more like   porcelain, and lacks the luster and iridescence of mother-of-pearl. \n A pearl is formed inside these molluscs when minute hexagonal crystals of   aragonite and conchiolin (as a binder) are deposited over an irritant. As a   composite, it is tougher than the aragonite from which it's formed, and the   layered nature of the structure contributes to the luster of the pearl. \n An ideal pearl is spherical, but other shapes are common. A pearl may   even become cemented against the inner wall of the shell, and eventually   become a blister pearl. \n Most pearls are \"cultured\", meaning the oysters (or mussels) have been   opened and a \"seed\" inserted into the flesh of the oyster. The oyster then   secretes nacre over the seed, eventually covering it with mother-of-pearl   and a pearl is formed. Note that a natural pearl of significant size takes   many years to form, as only a fraction of a millimeter of nacre is deposited   each year. But for a cultured pearl, a bead is inserted as a seed (typically   composed of shell), and the oyster may be harvested (and the pearl removed)   in as little as six months, although for higher quality pearls (a thicker   layer of mother-of-pearl) the harvest may not be done for several years.   Different species have different secretion rates of nacre, so the minimum   time varies widely. \n At one time, pearls were very rare and expensive, because more than a   thousand oysters might be harvested to find a single pearl, and that one may   have been small or misshapen. However, raising oysters or freshwater pearl   mussels is relatively easy, and the process of inserting the \"seeds\" has   been perfected, such that cultured pearls are now harvested by the ton.   Still, only a fraction of the harvest will be of high-quality pearls. \n Note that imitation pearls are common. These may be made of ceramics,   plastics, or other materials. The simplest test (which is not,   unfortunately, infallible) is the \"tooth\" test. Rub the pearl against the   front of your tooth. If it feels smooth, it is a fake pearl. If it feels   slightly gritty, it may be genuine (or a really well-made fake). There is no   easy test for natural versus cultured pearls, other than to break it or   slice it to see if the interior is all concentric layers (as in a natural   pearl) or if the center (the bulk of the pearl) is ordinary shell material   without layering. \n Pearl is a Birthstone for June,   and for the astrological signs of   Scorpio and Cancer. It is the traditional gift for a 30th anniversary (reflecting its historical   high value), although in the modern lists Pearls are to be given for   the twelfth anniversary .

D. Wingfield.It stars David Jason as Detective Inspector William Edward \"Jack\" Frost, known almost universally as Jack, an experienced and dedicated detective who frequently clashes with his superiors. In his cases, Frost is assisted by a variety of different detective sergeants, with each bringing a different slant to the particular case. Comic relief is provided by Frost's interactions with the bureaucratically-minded Superintendent Norman Mullett, played by Bruce Alexander.The series is set in the fictional South-Midlands town of Denton, and is marked by a gritty tone. The role of Frost was notable in changing the public perception of David Jason from a predominantly comic actor to a dramatic actor. \n Main characters \n Edit Block \n DI Jack Frost, as depicted by the comic actor David Jason, is a very empathic and sensitive detective, whose talents are offset by human failings. This is marginally different to how he is portrayed in the novels, where he often lacks empathy and has a gruff, coarse, almost offensive tone. He is frequently shown to shirk paperwork, leaving his subordinates to do the work. Frost is widowed in the first episode. He had planned to leave his wife but just as he was going to tell her she announced that she had been diagnosed with terminal cancer. After going on a drinking session, he recklessly approached an armed man, who shot him. As a result of this he was awarded the highest British civilian award for gallantry, the George Cross. He is respected and admired by his colleagues and is shown to be a good-hearted, if flawed, character. \n Superintendent Norman Mullet (played by Bruce Alexander), a social climber concerned with appearances and ambitious for promotion, is Frost's boss and his constant foil on the job. Mullet has a love-hate relationship with Frost whose detective skills he admires but whose people and political skills he abhors. Mullet frequently threatens to sack Frost but Frost's ability to close cases usually saves him. In addition, receiving the George Cross made Frost \"the Chief Constable's blue-eyed boy\", thus protecting Frost from being sacked or retired by Superintendent Mullet. Frost's nickname for Mullet is \"Horn-rimmed Harry\" due to the traditional design of his spectacles and Frost also has a plastic, mounted grey mullet hanging on his office wall (a grey mullet is a species of fish commonly found in British coastal waters but not usually eaten as it is regarded as being bland).

Still, they had a massive 69 UK hit singles, 35 as 'The Shadows' plus 34 as 'Cliff Richard and The Shadows'. That's not bad you know? More than The Black Eyed Peas will ever enjoy, at any rate. Rather random comparison I know, but there is meaning in the madness. This debut album of theirs charted in only two countries, according to my incomplete records, hitting number one in the UK and number three in France, of all places. The album was recorded at the famous Abbey Road studios, although it was yet to be famous. The Beatles made it famous, but even the Beatles owed a stylistic debt to The Shadows, if nothing else. True, George Harrison was no Hank Marvin but the idea of a fully-formed, independant British group started with The Shadows, at least, as far as popular public concensus is concerned. I'm reviewing 'Cliff Sings' at the same time as writing this, listening to both together. When Cliff had the orchestra backing him and not The Shadows he sounded a hell of a lot less interesting. There is also a tie-in with Joe Meek, a huge favourite of mine. The Shadows eventually became a sanitised, acceptable version of what Joe Meek was trying to do with many of his instrumental groups, but that's to take nothing away from The Shadows who were at this stage a pretty exciting bunch. Sure, they may have been no Fabulous Flee-Rekkers, but Fabulous Flee-Rekkers only had one hit, The Shadows had 69. This is the only Shadows album by the way that features the original Shadows line up, Harris resigned in 1962. Ah, Jet Harris MBE, I thank you. In 1998 he was awarded a Fender Lifetime Achievement Award for his role in popularising the bass guitar in Britain, his brief tenure with The Shadows went on to influence many bass players during the Sixties and right through the to the Seventies. That he ended up as a brick-layer after having several hits with (also former shadow) Tony Meehan is something of a disgrace. \n Ah, I want to throw this in. A full three years before The Beatles debut LP wrote in history forever than British groups previously relied on American songs, this album features 7 original compositions, of which 'Shadoogie' at least is utterly superb and really showcases the talents of all involved. But ah, Jet Harris. Based on this album alone you could say he was amongst the greatest of all British bass players, alongside Chris Squire and Peter Hook, in my own private reckonning. Well, not private any more, but listen to the guy on 'Nivram' and try to tell me he wasn't utterly superb - what a feeling! 'See You In My Drums' proves what great musicians these guys were - were 'Yes' ever influenced by The Shadows, does anybody know? Great Piano on 'Stand Up And Say That' and I do admit something of a guilty pleasure as far as Sixties instrumental music goes. Well, British rather than American, never could quite fall in love with 'The Ventures' in quite the same way. A truly electric and exciting 'Gonzales' continue to ensure the album thrills and then 'Find Me A Golden Street' is utterly wonderful atmospherics. 'My Resitance Is Low' features several Joe Meek effects and it's a shame he never got to work with the group. Still, this a thoroughly absorbing album all should hear.

{"question": "Which BBC TV sitcom about a retired security guard was set at 37 Wyngate Drive in the first series then at 19, Riverbank for the final 5 series?", "answers": ["meldrew"], "context": "Victor MeldrewVictor Meldrew is a fictional character in the BBC One sitcom One Foot in the Grave, created by David Renwick and portrayed by Richard Wilson. The character epitomised the archetypal grumpy old man. Meldrew is a foil for the bothersome aspects of children, cars, animals, power cuts and next-door neighbours (his particular example being Patrick Trench, played by Angus Deayton). The character was created specifically for Wilson, with whom Renwick had worked on the series Hot Metal, though Wilson initially turned the part down as at 53, he felt he was too young to play the 60-year-old Meldrew. Renwick considered Les Dawson for the part before Wilson changed his mind.  \n __TOC__ \n Character  \n In the first episode, the cantankerous Meldrew, aged 60, is forced into retirement as a security guard (which he describes as \"being replaced by a box\"). The series follows Meldrew as he tries to fill his new-found leisure with odd jobs and unusual idiosyncrasies, or to get a new job. However, he regularly finds himself mistreated, misunderstood or simply the victim of bad luck, which leads to his complaining heartily. \n The pensioner is most famous for his catchphrase, \"I don't believe it!!\", an expression of discontent which was actually used fairly infrequently. Quite often, he stops short at \"I don't ...\". According to Wilson, this is because series creator Renwick wanted to avoid overusing it.. Other frequently used expressions of exasperation are \"Unbe-lieeeve-able!\", \"What in the name of bloody hell?!\" and \"In the name of sanity!\" Victor is something of a hypochondriac, keeping a medical book with him to look up every ailment he believes has befallen him. (Margaret describes it as \"browsing through to see what he can die of next\".) \n The series was so successful that in the UK the term a Victor Meldrew has become a euphemism for a bitter and complaining elderly man. However, both Renwick and Wilson himself have disagreed that Victor is an example of this stereotype; Wilson himself once said in an interview that he was a \"normal man in a world full of idiots\", and he is shown to be more of a tragicomedy character, not bitter and grumpy by nature, but driven to it due to his habit of attracting trouble. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name \"Victor\" is ironic, since he almost always ends up as the loser.  \n Although he is seen as misanthropic by the many victims of his wrath and misfortune, Victor is often depicted as an honest, likeable and sympathetic character. Ultimately, many felt that the things that he railed against, e.g. yobbish behaviour, lack of consideration for others, shoddy service, and bureaucratic indifference, were things that he had every right to get angry about. In fact, if anything, most admired him for having the guts to stand up and be counted, as the bizarre misfortunes that befell Meldrew would be enough to exasperate anyone. In the episode \"Warm Champagne\", his long-suffering wife Margaret defends him. When Margaret contemplates having an affair with Ben, a man she meets on holiday, Ben puts Victor down and accuses him of being insensitive. Margaret replies that Victor is in fact the most sensitive person she's ever met. If he weren't so sensitive, he wouldn't be upset by the smallest of things, and that is the reason she loves him (and \"continually wants to ram his head through a television screen\"). In \"Descent into the Maelstrom\", Margaret is visited by a woman she used to care for as a child, but Victor discovered that she was in fact mentally unstable, sought by the police for kidnapping a toddler, and had stolen a pair of earrings Margaret treasured. Victor turned the woman over to the authorities and chose not to tell Margaret, preferring to let her think he had lost the earrings, knowing how much the truth would upset her.

It is basically a granite outcrop about three miles long and half a mile wide. Whilst the top of Lundy is reasonably flat, it has very steep sides. The west side of the island is exposed to the Atlantic Ocean and has considerably less vegetation than the more sheltered east side which faces the mainland. \n The Island is owned by the National Trust and is financed, administered and maintained by The Landmark Trust. The Landmark Trust is a charity which acquires and restores buildings and places of historic and architectural interest and makes them available for short term lets. \n There are about 20 permanent staff on the island. They work the farm, run the tavern, the self catering properties and all the other facilities. There are over 20 buildings that can be rented by holiday-makers. \n Visitors to the island normally arrive by ship . The island's own supply ship, the MS Oldenburg, departs from Bideford or Illfracombe regularly throughout the year; the 25 mile trip taking a little over two hours. \n The main centre of activity on the island, especially in the evenings, is the Marisco Tavern. Up to a few years ago beer was brewed on the island but it is now 'imported' from the mainland. \n Lundy is very popular for various groups of people including birdwatchers, climbers, divers and radio amateurs . Groups of bell ringers regularly come over to ring the bells of St. Helena's church which have recently been fully restored. \n Lundy is famous for its birds, especially the Puffin, although in recent times their numbers have been reducing. In July 1998 there were believed to be only about 60 Puffins on the island (I saw two !). The name Lund-ey is Norse for Puffin Island.  \n For pictures of Lundy Island go to the Photo Galleries. \n Click here for a large scale map of Lundy. \n For details of travel to and accommodation on Lundy, please go to the official Lundy Island web site or contact: The Landmark Trust , Shottesbrooke, Maidenhead, Berkshire, SL6 3SW. \n Tel: +44 628 825 925 \n    Lundy Island - 24CaratLundy Island \n Lundy Island \n According to Wikipedia: \n Lundy is the largest island in the Bristol Channel, lying 12 miles (19 km) off the coast of Devon, England, approximately one third of the distance across the channel between England and Wales. It measures about 3 miles (5 km) by 0.75 miles (1.2 km) at its widest. Lundy gives its name to a British sea area and is one of the islands of England. \n The name Lundy is believed to come from the old Norse word for \"puffin island\" (Lundey), lundi being the Norse word for a puffin and ey, an island, although an alternative explanation has been suggested with Lund referring to a copse, or wooded area. According to genealogist Edward MacLysaght the surname Lundy is from Norman de la Lounde, a name recorded in medieval documents in counties Tipperary and Kilkenny in Ireland. \n Coins of Lundy \n The first issue was issued in 1929 by the self-declared 'King of Lundy', Martin Coles Harman, who was an English businessman, born 1885, Steyning, Sussex, who bought Lundy in 1925. There were two coins - the Half Puffin and the One Puffin, which were rated at the same nominal value as the British Halfpenny and Penny. The obverse of the coins depict a portrait facing left with 'MARTIN.COLES.HARMAN'. The edges of the coins are lettered with the inscription 'LUNDY LIGHTS AND LEADS', a reference to the island's two lighthouses. The reverse of the Half Puffin coin depicts a puffin's head. The reverse of the One Puffin coin depicts a puffin facing left on a rocky ledge. The unfussy and strong design of the coins is regarded as more than competent with significant modernist touches which foresee the high 1930's design school", "parametric_answer": "iceland", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

During the Italian occupation of Corfu, in the Second World War, this palace became the residence of Parini, the Italian governor of the Ionian Islands. \n Along the decades, the ownership of the palace was argued between the Greek government and the former Greek royal family. The former King Constantine of Greece thought Mon Repos was his property, because it used to be his summer residence during his reign. However, the Greek government would not accept this claim and was considering this residence a Greek state's ownership. \n Finally, in 2002, the European Court of Human Rights at Strasburg awarded to the former king compensation of 7 million for the three properties he lost when monarchy was abolished in Greece, in 1975. Nowadays this house is used by the Municipality of Corfu as a tourist attraction and is visited by hundreds of tourists every year. The palace has today been restored and reflects its original and classical imposing features. \n It hosts a museum that includes many Ionian treasures.

{"question": "Which ship did Drake command against the Spanish Armada?", "answers": ["revenge"], "context": "Francis DrakeSir Francis Drake, vice admiral ( – 27 January 1596) was an English sea captain, privateer, navigator, slaver, and politician of the Elizabethan era. Drake carried out the second circumnavigation of the world in a single expedition, from 1577 to 1580, and was the first to complete the voyage as captain while leading the expedition throughout the entire circumnavigation. With his incursion into the Pacific he inaugurated an era of privateering and piracy in the western coast of the Americasan area that had previously been free of piracy. \n Elizabeth I of England awarded Drake a knighthood in 1581. He was second-in-command of the English fleet against the Spanish Armada in 1588. He died of dysentery in January of 1596  after unsuccessfully attacking San Juan, Puerto Rico. \n His exploits made him a hero to the English but a pirate to the Spaniards to whom he was known as El Draque.  King Philip II was said to have offered a reward of 20,000 ducats, about £4 million (US$6.5m) by modern standards, for his life. \n Birth and early years \n Francis Drake was born in Tavistock, Devon, England. Although his birth is not formally recorded, it is known that he was born while the Six Articles were in force. \"Drake was two and twenty when he obtained the command of the Judith\"  (1566). This would date his birth to 1544. A date of c.1540 is suggested from two portraits: one a miniature painted by Nicholas Hilliard in 1581 when he was allegedly 42, the other painted in 1594 when he was said to be 53.1921/22 edition of the Dictionary of National Biography, which quotes Barrow's Life of Drake (1843) p. 5. \n He was the eldest of the twelve sons  of Edmund Drake (1518–1585), a Protestant farmer, and his wife Mary Mylwaye.  The first  son was alleged to have been named after his godfather Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford.Froude, James Anthony, English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century, London, 1896. Quote: \"He told Camden that he was of mean extraction. He meant merely that he was proud of his parents and made no idle pretensions to noble birth. His father was a tenant of the Earl of Bedford, and must have stood well with him, for Francis Russell, the heir of the earldom, was the boy's godfather.\" \n Because of religious persecution during the Prayer Book Rebellion in 1549, the Drake family fled from Devonshire into Kent. There the father obtained an appointment to minister the men in the King's Navy.  He was ordained deacon and was made vicar of Upnor Church on the Medway.Southey, Robert. (1897). English Seamen — Howard Clifford Hawkins Drake Cavendish, Methuen and Co. 36 Essex Street WC London Drake's father apprenticed Francis to his neighbour, the master of a barque used for coastal trade transporting merchandise to France. The ship master was so satisfied with the young Drake's conduct that, being unmarried and childless at his death, he bequeathed the barque to Drake. \n Marriage and family \n Francis Drake married Mary Newman in 1569.  She died 12 years later, in 1581.  In 1585, Drake married Elizabeth Sydenham—born circa 1562, the only child of Sir George Sydenham, of Combe Sydenham,  who was the High Sheriff of Somerset.  After Drake's death, the widow Elizabeth eventually married Sir William Courtenay of Powderham.  \n Sailing career \n At age 23, Drake made his first voyage to the Americas, sailing with his second cousin, Sir John Hawkins, on one of a fleet of ships owned by his relatives, the Hawkins family of Plymouth. In 1568 Drake was again with the Hawkins fleet when it was trapped by the Spaniards in the Mexican port of San Juan de Ulúa. He escaped along with Hawkins. \n Following the defeat at San Juan de Ulúa, Drake vowed revenge.  He made two voyages to the West Indies, in 1570 and 1571, of which little is known. \n In 1572, he embarked on his first major independent enterprise", "parametric_answer": "defiance", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

The claim may be a bit too bold.  While American origin can be claimed for all turkeys, some colors weren't  developed in the U.S., including some that were probably developed in Europe. \n The Black, sometimes called Black Spanish or Norfolk Black, is  one of these. As its other names indicate, the Spanish and English also claim  its development. However, Blacks were probably among the first turkeys sent to  Spain, perhaps because they were a rarity in their own land. This was probably  the case with whites too. Black or mostly Black turkeys were mentioned by early  explorers but don't seem to have been the dominant type anywhere. They did  better in the Old World, quickly becoming the dominant type in Spain and Norfolk  County, England. They were also common in the rest of England as well as in  France and Italy. In this country, flocks referred to as Norfolk Black are  usually marked with white as the original Norfolk Blacks often were. Today,  in England this color is found on Longer Right Breasts, while the Norfolks are  completely black. \n Following text with permission from \n \"1998 SPPA Turkey Census  Report\" \n by Paula Johnson \n The Black is a very old variety, possibly the first  variety to be developed. Probably some of the original turkeys taken to Europe  were black. The Black turkey was very popular all across Europe, but  especially in Spain and Norfolk County, England. I have been told that there can  be two varieties of Black turkeys called the Spanish and the Norfolk. The adult  Norfolk turkeys (in the U.S.) can have some white tipped feathers with pink toes  and shanks. The British poultry Standard of 1951-1971 calls for the Norfolk Black  to have black shanks and toes with no white in the feathers. The adult Spanish  Blacks are completely black with solid black feather, shanks and toes. I have  kept two lines over the years and both adult strains had black shanks and toes,  but one line had white in the feathers and the other had no white at all. The  Black turkey was admitted to the APA Standard in 1874, and it is interesting to  note, that the current APA Standard calls for the shanks of adult Black turkeys  to be pink with no white in the feathers. . . . Standard weights are 33 pounds for  toms and 18 for hens. \n The census resulted in 164 females and 47 males listed by 15  breeders. The Blacks made up 7% of the historical Farm turkeys found by the  survey. Only one hatchery had over 100 females with 105 hens and 15 toms. The  next largest flock has 8 females. The Blacks number 4th in rank of the varieties  with the most individual turkeys. If you raise Blacks, please do not drop  them to raise another variety! We do not have enough breeders.

Make sure you check the water level frequently, so it never boils dry. The pudding should be a dark brown color when cooked. The pudding is not a light cake but instead is a dark, sticky and dense sponge. \n Remove the pudding from the steamer, cool completely. Remove the paper, prick the pudding with a skewer and pour in a little extra brandy. Cover with fresh greaseproof paper and retie with string. Store in a cool, dry place until Christmas day. Note: The pudding cannot be eaten immediately, it does need to be stored and rested then reheated on Christmas Day. Eating the pudding immediately after cooking will cause it to collapse, and the flavours will not have had time to mature. \n On Christmas day reheat the pudding by steaming again for about an hour.

The distillate, a clear liquid, is then usually aged in oak barrels. \n The majority of the world's rum production occurs in the Caribbean and Latin America.  Rum is also produced in Austria, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, the Philippines, India, Reunion Island, Mauritius, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, the United States, and Canada. \n Rums are produced in various grades. Light rums are commonly used in cocktails, whereas \"golden\" and \"dark\" rums were typically consumed straight or neat, on the rocks, or used for cooking, but are now commonly consumed with mixers. Premium rums are also available, made to be consumed either straight or iced. \n Rum plays a part in the culture of most islands of the West Indies as well as in The Maritimes and Newfoundland. This beverage has famous associations with the Royal Navy (where it was mixed with water or beer to make grog) and piracy (where it was consumed as bumbo).  Rum has also served as a popular medium of economic exchange, used to help fund enterprises such as slavery (see Triangular trade), organized crime, and military insurgencies (e.g., the American Revolution and Australia's Rum Rebellion). \n Etymology \n The origin of the word \"rum\" is generally unclear. In an 1824 essay about the word's origin, Samuel Morewood, a British etymologist, suggested it might be from the British slang term for \"the best\", as in \"having a rum time.\" He wrote: \n Given the harsh taste of early rum, this is unlikely. Morewood later suggested another possibility: that it was taken from the last syllable of the Latin word for sugar, saccharum, an explanation commonly heard today. \n Other etymologists have mentioned the Romani word rum, meaning \"strong\" or \"potent\". These words have been linked to the ramboozle and rumfustian, both popular British drinks in the mid-17th century. However, neither was made with rum, but rather eggs, ale, wine, sugar, and various spices. The most probable origin is as a truncated version of rumbullion or rumbustion.

It stars an often mischevious cat who has taken on a number of roles over the decades. \n Korky made his debut in the very first issue of The Dandy' in 1937, drawn by Jimmy Crighton , and his strip was printed on the comic's cover.

Thanks to Steve Zodiac for supplying this image \n A classic Korky cover from 1958 \n What tuppence bought you in 1955 \n Korky the Cat is one of the most instantly recognizable characters in UK comics history, and also one of the longest running. Although his star has undoubtedly declined in recent times, his name and visual appearance are probably still synonymous with the  Dandy as much as Mickey Mouse is with the Disney organization: only Desperate Dan himself has enjoyed more enduring success, when it comes to widespread fame associated with this comic. Even many adults who have never picked up a comic for years, as well as much of the non-comic-reading public, have certainly heard of, and would recognize a picture of, this character. \n It all began way, way back on December 4, 1937, when the cat was selected to star on the cover of the debut issue: early editions depicted the moggy in pantomime, slapstick-like cavortings, possibly inspired by Pat Sullivan and Otto Messmers' huge cinematic success with Felix the Cat during the silent era. The very early Korky was clearly more cat-like than the version we recognize today, although it wasn't long before original artist James Crighton imbued him with more Disney-like anthropomorphisms, which undoubtedly accelerated his popularity among readers. \n Crighton proved to be an excellent choice as original Korky artist. Before long, the cat's world was fully developed, with many incidental characters inhabiting the strip: street-kids, tramps, policemen, soldiers and all manner of 'supporting characters' who made up everyday 'walk-on' creations who were required for Korky to 'act' against. Seen today, Crighton's work looks dated in some respects, but there's no denying the skill, charm, story-book-like quality, and, above all, appeal factor that makes his work so attractive and entertaining, even to modern eyes. This is undoubtedly one of the reasons why vintage copies of the Dandy are still so sought after today. \n After around three years of silent Felix-like frolics, more depth was introduced to Korky's character with the use of word-balloons, with the first-ever quotation from the cat being: 'Let's ask the butcher for some sausages!'

NAVAL OBSERVATORY: The International Date Line \n (Note: CBC does not endorse and is not responsible for the content of external links.) \n When the south Pacific nation of Samoa decided to  shift the international dateline  some distance to the east, in the process losing itself an entire day off the calendar, it was far from the first time the line has moved. \n Here's a look at five facts about the line that marks the spot on the globe where the day changes. \n It's imaginary. \n The international date line is an imaginary north-south line drawn through the middle of the Pacific Ocean about half way around the world, close to the 180 degrees of longitude from the Prime Meridian, which cuts through Greenwich, England. \n The date line shown on most maps is the one drawn by the British Admiralty in 1921, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory. \n It has no force in international law. \n The line is one of convenience — any given day has to start and end somewhere — and it is not recognized as a legal entity. It has no international status, and was not defined at the 1884 Prime Meridian conference in Washington, D.C., or by any other treaty, according to the website of the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. \n It zigzags quite a bit. \n Countries near the international date line have moved it over the years to take into account their needs or concerns. One of the biggest zigs occurs around Kiribati, an island nation of 32 atolls that straddles the equator. In 1995, Kiribati moved a chunk of the line to the east so that the entire country was on the same side. \n For Samoa, the time jump means that its 186,000 citizens, as well as the 1,500 in the three-atoll UN dependency of Tokelau, will be on the same day of the week as most of their main trading partners. \n Perhaps more importantly they will now be the first in the world to ring in the new year, rather than the last. \n The mid-way point actually crosses very few bits of land. \n Three islands that are part of Fiji — Vanua Levu, Rambi and Taveuni — are the only islands actually crossed by the 180-degree line, according to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. That line also crosses Wrangel Island, part of the far northeast of Russia and Antarctica. \n It addresses the phenomenon of gaining or losing a day noticed by circumnavigator Ferdinand Magellan and literary character Phileas Fogg in Jules Verne's Around the World in 80 Days. \n When the Portuguese explorer Magellan and his crew returned from their 16th-century westward circumnavigation of the globe, they discovered that one day had somehow been lost.

The song tells the story of an old woman who swallowed increasingly large animals, each to catch the previously swallowed animal. There are many variations of phrasing in the lyrics, especially for the description of swallowing each animal. The spider and fly are described in each verse, but the other animals are only described when they are introduced.The absurdity stems from the increasingly improbable solutions that only worsen the initial problem and are more likely to cause the woman's death: the logic of swallowing of even more animals of ridiculous sizes without dying, contrasted with the expected, matter-of-fact recounting of her death from swallowing an animal larger than herself, when in fact the swallowing of any animal as a solution was absurd. \n A widely distributed version of the song was released on Brunswick Records in 1953, where it was sung by Burl Ives. A 1961 version in print indicates that the lyrics are by Rose Bonne, where the music in that edition was composed by Alan Mills.  For a further example remaining in print, see   \n Lyrics \n The following is one published, readily available form of the lyrics, that are representative of the nature of this cumulative lyric: \n There was an old lady who swallowed a fly \n I don't know why she swallowed a fly - perhaps she'll die! \n There was an old lady who swallowed a spider, \n That wriggled and wiggled and tiggled inside her; \n She swallowed the spider to catch the fly; \n I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die!  \n There was an old lady who swallowed a bird; \n How absurd to swallow a bird. \n She swallowed the bird to catch the spider, \n She swallowed the spider to catch the fly; \n I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die! \n There was an old lady who swallowed a cat; \n Fancy that to swallow a cat! \n She swallowed the cat to catch the bird, \n She swallowed the bird to catch the spider, \n She swallowed the spider to catch the fly; \n I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die! \n There was an old lady that swallowed a dog; \n What a hog, to swallow a dog; \n She swallowed the dog to catch the cat, \n She swallowed the cat to catch the bird, \n She swallowed the bird to catch the spider, \n She swallowed the spider to catch the fly; \n I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die! \n There was an old lady who swallowed a cow, \n I don't know how she swallowed a cow; \n She swallowed the cow to catch the dog, \n She swallowed the dog to catch the cat, \n She swallowed the cat to catch the bird, \n She swallowed the bird to catch the spider, \n She swallowed the spider to catch the fly; \n I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die! \n There was an old lady who swallowed a horse...; \n ...She's dead, of course!  \n In some versions, \"perhaps she'll die\" is replaced with \"don't ask me why.\" Also, \"she died of course\" is replaced with \"of course, of course, she swallowed a horse,\" leading to yet another cumulative verse that ends the tale. \n Representative renditions \n *The song was used for an animated cartoon sung by Burl Ives.

The two come together in the famous fourth section of Gustav Holst ’s suite The Planets: JUPITER, THE BRINGER OF JOLLITY . It’s conducted by Sir Adrian Boult in one of several recordings he made of the work. It was he who conducted the very first performance in September 1918. \n That central theme is often sung to words written in 1908 by the British diplomat Sir Cecil Spring-Rice: ‘I vow to thee, my country’. In 1921 Holst adapted the tune from ‘Jupiter’ to fit the words and re-titled it ‘Thaxted’ after the village in Essex where he lived. It’s a popular choice of music at weddings. So is this next piece, though you might not recognise it from its original German title. English-speaking audiences know it as ‘JESU, JOY OF MAN’S DESIRING’ from the Cantata No. 147 by J. S. Bach . \n On a livelier note, how about the last movement ‘Le Bal (Galop)’ from Bizet’s suite for piano duet, JEUX D’ENFANTS (‘Children’s Games’) . \n Now for something rather different to illustrate a double ‘J’: JOSEPH JOACHIM (1831-1907) was one of the greatest violinists of the 19th century. He was the dedicatee and gave the first performance of Brahms’s Violin Concerto, and premiered a number of other masterpieces. In 1903 he recorded five pieces and music for the fledgling G&T (later HMV) label, the first important violinist to make a recording. On one of them he plays his own arrangement of the Hungarian Dance No.1 by his friend Brahms. \n Not bad for a recording 110 years old and a fascinating glimpse of how the violin was played in 19th century. \n The next ‘J’ is the Czech composer Leos JANACEK (1854-1928) best known for his operas JENUFA, The Cunning Little Vixen, Katya Kabanova and The Makropoulos Affair, his napster for orchestra Taras Bulba, Sinfonietta and choral masterpiece Glagolitic Mass. Lesser known are his chamber works, like this first movement from his String Quartet No.1 ‘The Kreutzer Sonata’ inspired by Tolstoy’s novella of the same name. \n Byron JANIS (b.1928) is the first of three ‘J’ pianists I’ve included. Here he is in 1962 at the height of his brilliant career before crippling and painful arthritis curtailed his activities. This is the first movement of Rachmaninov’s Piano Concerto No.1 . \n ‘J’ is for JAM and ‘JERUSALEM’ , an alternative national anthem (with ‘Land of Hope and Glory’) with words by the poet William Blake and music by Sir Hubert Parry (1848-1918). First performed in 1916 at the Queen’s Hall, London, it then became the rallying song for the ‘Votes for Women’ campaign, and was later taken up by the National Federation of Women’s Institutes. This is a full-throated, in yer face performance – just as it should be! \n Armas JÄRNEFELT (1869-1958) was a pioneering Finnish composer and conductor, the brother-in-law of Sibelius .

MARKHAM, Special to the New York Times \n Published: October 7, 1983 \n STOCKHOLM, Oct. 6— The Swedish Academy today awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature to the British novelist William Golding, author of ''Lord of the Flies,'' whose books plumb the nature of evil in man. But a senior member of the jury, in a rare public dissent, challenged the decision. \n Appearing as is traditional at the stroke of 1 P.M., Lars Gyllensten, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, announced the unexpected choice in the ancient institution's offices in the Stockholm stock exchange. \n An academy citation said the 72-year-old Mr. Golding had won the prize ''for his novels which, with the perspicuity of realistic narrative art and the diversity and universality of myth, illuminate the human condition in the world of today.''  Seventh Briton to Win \n Mr. Golding, who learned of the award in the Wiltshire village where he lives and writes, became the seventh British author to win the literary prize since it was first given in 1901. Established by the will of the Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, the prize is worth $191,815, or 1.5 million Swedish kronor. \n Conversing with journalists, Mr. Gyllensten, a powerful figure in the ranks of the elderly, 18-member Swedish Academy, described Mr. Golding as ''a fascinating and exciting writer'' whom he had first read in the 1950's after the appearance of ''Lord of the Flies.'' \n Mr. Gyllensten stressed that the academy sought to single out writers who were still active. ''The impact of his complete oeuvre has increased of course,'' he said of Mr. Golding, who in the late 1950's was something of a cult figure. In 1980, Mr. Golding won Britain's coveted Booker Prize.   Breaking a Tradition \n But Artur Lundkvist, a 77-year-old academy member and specialist on Latin American literature, denounced the choice of Mr. Golding and argued that the prize should have gone to Claude Simon, the avant- garde French philosopher and novelist. \n Breaking a tradition of silence about the academy's deliberations, Mr. Lundkvist told journalists that Mr. Golding was ''decent but hardly in the Nobel Prize class.'' He called the judgment a ''coup.'' \n Embarrassed by this public dissent, which is a first in recent memory, Mr. Gyllensten called Mr. Lundkvist's comments ''unfortunate'' and said the 77-year-old scholar had ''the soul of a magpie.'' He urged that Mr. Lundkvist's sharp words be taken ''with a grain of salt.'' \n The academy's permanent secretary said that members were supposed to remain silent for 55 years about the way they agreed upon Nobel laureates. \n ''It's one of the most closely guarded secrets there is,'' Roger Straus, the publisher, said about the selection process for the Nobel Prize.  ''They have their own screening committees and one never knows how names get on there.'' Mr. Straus is president of Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 15 of whose authors have won the Nobel Prize for Literature, including four of the past six. They are Mr. Golding, Elias Canetti (1981), Czeslw Milosz (1980) and Isaac Bashevis Singer (1978). \n ''The Nobel is not like the Pulitzer Prize, there is no way you can nominate writers,'' Mr. Straus said. ''Sometimes somebody from the Nobel Committee has written to International PEN and said they would be interested to know who you would nominate. But that does not happen often and perhaps they already have their list set by that time.'' \n Mr. Straus said there were reported to be two lists, a ''short list'' of candidates and a ''short, short list'' of finalists.

Grant was the 18th president of the United States. When Grant died, a tomb, in his memory, was built for him. New York architect, John Duncan, was chosen to design the tomb of the deceased president. The granite that was used in Grant's tomb was stony creek granite that came from the Stony Creek Red Granite Company that was founded began in 1889 and was eventually taken over by Thomas Pearson of New York. Construction of the president's tomb did not start until 1891, six years after his death. \n  After desecration and reconstruction, Grant's tomb serves as a memorial and also as a grand site for tourists to come and admire still to this day. \n Ulysses S. Grant was elected as the 18th president of the United States in 1868 and started his presidential term as part of the Republican Party on March 4, 1869. He was then re-elected in 1872, and ended his presidency on March 4, 1877. Before his presidency, Grant was a graduate from West Point Academy and then became a general in the United States Army. Abraham Lincoln appointed Grant as the Commanding General of the Army in 1864. Ulysses S. Grant, in 1865, ordered General William  Tecumseh  Sherman to move his army south while Grant and his Army of Potomac found Robert E. Lee’s army in Northern Virginia. William Tecumseh Sherman, also being a very famous general in the U.S. Army also has a monument dedicated to him in 1989 in New York City. His equestrian monument, made of stony creek granite, was sculpted by Augustus Saint-Gaudens and the architect behind the monument was Charles McKim. On April 9, 1865 at the Appomattox Court House, Grant wrote out terms for the surrender of Robert E. Lee. Not only did General Grant play a major role in the surrender of Lee’s army, he also was the Major General at the Battle of Shiloh, the Siege of Vicksburg, and also, many years ealier as a young officer, took part in the Mexican-American War. With many years in the military and great success as a general, it was clear that Grant was a major popular icon in the United States. \n Under his first term as president, Grant had come across numerous issues, considering the Civil War had just ended. During his re-election in 1872, Grant was attacked by the Liberal Republicans because they wanted amnesty for Confederate soldiers. This is where Charles Sumner coined the term “Grantism”, when Sumner accused Grant of political patronage, nepotism, and being an autocrat. Sumner was a leader of the Radical Republican party from Massachussetts. After Grant retired from his presidency in 1877 he shortly after became a partner in a financial firm with Ferdinand Ward. It was a brokerage firm that facilitated the buying and selling of financial derivatives. However, in 1884, the company Ward & Grant went bankrupt and Ward fled. It was said that the firm went bankrupt because of the failure of the Marine National Bank of New York. After the bankruptcy, Grant was diagnosed with throat cancer. For the remainder of his life he worked in writing a memoir to pay of his debt to support his family. Ulysses S. Grant died on July 23, 1885. \n Before Grant died, discussion about where he would be buried took place. Many people believed that he should choose to be buried at West Point. However, Grant declined this burial site because he knew that his wife, Julia Grant, would not be able to be buried next to him at West Point. Mayor William R. Grace said that he would set aside a piece of land in one of New York’s parks for Grant’s burial site. When Ulysses died, the Grant family decided to bury him in Riverside Park in Manhattan.

And, as might be expected, they pin the blame for the collapse of the original push for them under the Coalition on the Liberal Democrats.  “The Government was offering new mayors but with no new powers,” said one.  “There was nothing to fire the imagination and no big campaign of support. The outcome was inevitable.” \n Bristol voted Yes. Nine other cities voted No.  Conservative localists, such as Greg Clark, retired to lick their wounds.  But Osborne kept a flame burning for the elected Mayors project and for a Tory electoral drive in the north.  In policy terms, he wanted, as another friend puts it, “to combine the best of Lawson and Heseltine”.  In political ones, he believes that the Party’s electoral weakness in northern urban areas should be reversed – not accepted, shrugged at, or explained away. \n This means raising the present total of Conservative MPs in those areas from 20 out of 124 . If the Chancellor had, say, Leeds on his doorstep, his strategy might well have got nowhere.  But he had Manchester, and therein lay an opportunity.  While Liverpool travelled to the left during the 1980s, Manchester City Council stayed in Labour’s mainstream.  The independent-minded Graham Stringer, now an MP, led it. \n Stringer’s successor is Sir Richard Leese.  Its Chief Executive is Sir Howard Bernstein.  Osborne knows them both well from his 15 years in Tatton,", "parametric_answer": "esther mcvey", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

Walton agreed enthusiastically and completed the work in a fortnight. \n The march was played in Westminster Abbey immediately before the ceremony, for the entrance of Queen Mary, the Queen Mother. It must have made an impressive effect indeed in that historic setting. The royal family was popular and the British Empire still an imperial power. The broad cantabile melody exudes confidence, rising to an impressive brass climax to which even the most dedicated republican can thrill. This was no time for subtlety and introspection, and Walton 's music is both majestic and imperious. \n Appears On  Crown Imperial (Walton) original 1937 recording - YouTubeCrown Imperial (Walton) original 1937 recording - YouTube \n Crown Imperial (Walton) original 1937 recording \n Want to watch this again later? \n Sign in to add this video to a playlist. \n Need to report the video? \n Sign in to report inappropriate content. \n Rating is available when the video has been rented. \n This feature is not available right now.

{"question": "Which wading bird is the symbol of the RSPB?", "answers": ["avocets"], "context": "Rise of the Avocets: symbol of the RSPB enjoys record year ...Rise of the Avocets: symbol of the RSPB enjoys record year (From The Argus) \n 0 comments \n THE avocet, a wader once close to extinction in the UK, which now flocks to Poole Harbour in its thousands in winter, has enjoyed a record breaking year. \n The RSPB, whose emblem is the black and white bird, says the south west estuaries are now home to an internationally important population. \n Avocets returned to Minsmere in Suffolk in 1947 after an absence of more than 100 years, and numbers have continued to grow across the UK. \n Poole Harbour is of particular importance as a winter refuge for the birds as are the Tamar and Exe. The harbour is now home to a flock of 2,000 avocets in the cold months, an increase from just 25 individuals 30 years ago, representing 40 per cent of the total UK wintering population. \n \"The avocet is a wonderful success story and proves that conservation efforts to save species, and safeguarding special places can really work,\" said Tony Whitehead, spokesman for the RSPB in Dorset. \n \"It's a delight to watch these elegant wading birds, the RSPB's iconic emblem on our estuaries in winter.\" \n Mike Clarke, RSPB's chief executive, said: \"Avocets continue to take up residence around the country - often colonising places that we and others have created for them. \n \"They are a symbol of conservation success - and the reason they feature as the logo of the RSPB.\" \n There have been other notable successes in the south west this year including the return of storm petrels to the Isles of Scilly and Lundy, bittern numbers are continuing to rise on Somerset reserves and cirl buntings have been re-introduced to Cornwall. \n Mr Whitehead said: \"The south west in winter is one of the best places to watch wildlife. If people haven't yet seen avocet or want really good views of the birds, the best way is to join one of our winter bird cruises. \n \"On these you can also enjoy lots of other winter visitors, from brent geese to godwits, wigeon and a multitude of other wintering birds.\" \n There are Poole Harbour cruises on November 29, January 10 and February 13 and cruises landing at Brownsea Island on December 13, January 30 and February 16.

{"question": "Which river rises in Huyton and meets the coast at Hightown?", "answers": ["alt"], "context": "HuytonHuyton ( ) is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley, in Merseyside, England. \n It is part of the Liverpool Urban Area sharing borders with the Liverpool suburbs of Dovecot, Knotty Ash, Belle Vale and has close associations with its neighbour the village of Roby, both were formerly part of the Huyton with Roby Urban District between 1894 and 1974. \n Historically in Lancashire, Huyton was an ancient parish which, in the mid-19th century, contained Croxteth Park, Knowsley and Tarbock, in addition to the township of Huyton-with-Roby. It was part of West Derby (hundred), an ancient subdivision of Lancashire, covering the south-west of the county. \n History \n Medieval \n Huyton was first settled about 600-650 AD by Angles.  The settlement was founded on a low hill surrounded by inaccessible marshy land. The name Huyton gives a clue as to its origins. The first part of the name may suggest a landing-place, probably on the banks of the River Alt.  (The area of land now known as Huyton Wetlands .  is the source of the River). \n Both Huyton and Roby are mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, Huyton being spelt Hitune. \n Industrial development \n Huyton-with-Roby is situated near to the south western extremity of the former Lancashire coalfield. In the 19th century Welsh immigrants settled in the area to work in nearby colleries. A Welsh-speaking Non-conformist chapel (Calvinistic Methodists) was founded in Wood Lane, Huyton Quarry. Nearby Cronton Colliery finally ceased production in March 1984, shortly before the UK miners' strike (1984–1985). Both Huyton and Roby have railway stations on the famous Liverpool and Manchester Railway (The station at Huyton Quarry closed in 1958 and today only the main station building remains). The railway’s construction was supervised by George Stephenson and, when it opened in 1830, it became the world’s first regular passenger train service. On the day of the railway's official opening, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington alighted the train at Roby railway station.  \n Second World War \n During the Second World War, Huyton suffered bombing from the Luftwaffe. Some Huyton residents were killed or injured but the scale of destruction was nowhere close to that experienced by Liverpool, Bootle and Birkenhead. Unlike Liverpool, schoolchildren were not evacuated from Huyton but schools and homes were provided with air-raid shelters. \n Huyton was also host to three wartime camps: an internment camp, a prisoner of war camp and a base for American servicemen (G.I.s). \n The internment camp, one of the biggest in the country, was created to accommodate those 'enemy aliens' deemed a potential threat to national security. Churchill's demand to 'collar the lot' meant that around 27,000 people ended up being interned in the UK. Some internees were actually refugees from the Nazis, including socialists such as Kurt Hager and a large number of artists attacked for their 'degeneracy' in an infamous Nazi art exhibition in 1937 (see Degenerate art). Huyton internees included artists Martin Bloch, Hugo Dachinger, and Walter Nessler, dancer Kurt Jooss, musicians, sociologist Norbert Elias, anthropologist Eric Wolf and composer Hans Gál.  More than 40 per cent of Huyton's internees were over 50 years old. \n The camp, first occupied in May 1940, was formed around several streets of new, empty council houses and flats and then made secure with high barbed wire fencing. Twelve internees were allocated to each house, but overcrowding resulted in many sleeping in tents. Initially the camp was only meant to hold the internees until they could be shipped to the Isle of Man. However, largely in response to the torpedoing of the transport ship 'The Arandora Star', with the loss of nearly 700 people, the deportations ended. Most of the internees were released long before the camp closed in 1942. The camp was sited in and around what became known as the 'Bluebell Estate' and many of the streets were given names of the great battles of the Second World War.  \n The prisoner of war camp closed in 1948.", "parametric_answer": "mersey", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}
{"question": "Which Australian cricketer scored a record number of runs for a number 11 batsman in a Test Match innings, during the first Ashes Test of 2013 at Trent Bridge?", "answers": ["ashton agar"], "context": "Stats analysis: A new high for No. 11 | Cricket | ESPN ...Stats analysis: A new high for No. 11 |  Cricket  | ESPN Cricinfo \n England v Australia, 1st Investec Test, Trent Bridge, 2nd day July 11, 2013 \n A new high for No. 11 \n Stats highlights from the second of the Trent Bridge Test, which was dominated by Australia's latest No. 11, Ashton Agar \n 9 \n Ashton Agar's wagon wheel \n Ashton Agar's 98 is the highest by a No. 11 batsman in Test history. The previous highest was 95 by Tino Best of West Indies, also against England, at Edgbaston in 2012. The previous-best for Australia was by Glenn McGrath, who handed Agar his Baggy Green on Wednesday; McGrath scored 61 against New Zealand at the Gabba in 2004. Agar's 98 was also only the second half-century by a No.11 batsman in an Ashes Test - the previous one was by Frederick Spofforth in this match , way back in 1885. \n When Agar drove James Anderson through midwicket and picked up three runs to move from 43 to 46, he broke the record for the highest score by a No. 11 batsman on debut. That was previously held by Warwick Armstrong, who scored an unbeaten 45 against England in 1902. Click here for a list of highest scores by No. 11 batsmen on debut. \n The 163-run partnership between Phil Hughes and Agar was the highest ever for the tenth wicket in Tests. This was also only the fifth hundred partnership for the tenth wicket in an Ashes Test, and the 23rd tenth-wicket century partnership in all Tests. \n This was only the ninth instance of a No.11 batsman top-scoring in an innings. Four of these nine instances have been by Australia batsmen, the most by a team, and four of these have come against England, the most against a team. The previous instance of a No. 11 top-scoring was by Nathan Lyon, the player who Agar replaced in the XI - Lyon scored 14 out of a total of 47 against South Africa in Cape Town in 2011. The previous such instance in an Ashes Test was way back in 1896, when Tom McKibbin scored 16 out of 44 at The Oval. \n A break-up of Agar's runs against each bowler indicates just how proficient he was against both pace and spin. Against Graeme Swann's offspin, he scored at a run a ball, taking 36 off 36, including four fours and two sixes. Against the three quick bowlers, he scored 62 off 65, including eight fours. And as his wagon-wheel shows, he scored on both sides of the wicket, scoring 42 runs on the off side, and 56 on the leg side. \n While Agar was dominant against both pace and spin, Hughes scored his runs almost entirely against the fast bowlers. Against Anderson, Finn and Broad, he scored 74 off 89 balls. Against Swann, though, he only managed 7 off 52 balls. \n Ashton Agar v each England bowler \n Bowler \n 2/ 0 \n 13 \n Hughes' unbeaten 81 was easily his highest in ten Test innings against England - his previous-best was 36 in Cardiff in 2009. \n Agar was clearly the star of the day, but England had their heroes too. James Anderson picked up his 14th five-for in Tests, his second against Australia and his fifth at Trent Bridge; at no other venue has he taken as many five-fors. He ended the day with 44 wickets at Trent Bridge, the highest by any bowler at this ground. \n For the first time in his 44-Test career, Jonathan Trott was dismissed for a first-ball duck . This was also his first duck in England; his three previous ones were in Sydney, Ahmedabad and Mumbai. With Ed Cowan also being dismissed without scoring, this was the 11th instance of two zeroes by No.3 batsmen in an Ashes Test - the previous such instance was in 1995. \n S Rajesh is stats editor of ESPNcricinfo.

He was educated at                 Oxford University, after which he spent a short                 time in his family's publishing business                 (Macmillan Publishers). He fought with                 distinction during World War I ,                 and was wounded three times. From 1919 to 1920 he                 was an aide to the Governor General of Canada. \n Early Political                 Career \n In 1924, Macmillan was elected                 as the Conservative MP for Stockton-on-Trent. He                 lost his seat in 1929, but regained it in 1931.                 He continued to serve in Parliament until                 becoming Prime Minister in 1957. During his time                 in Parliament he was a vocal advocate for social                 support, and joined Winston                 Churchill 's criticism                 of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's                 appeasement policy towards Germany. \n Macmillan's first ministerial                 post was parliamentary secretary to the Ministry                 of Supply, in which capacity he served from 1940                 to 1942. In 1942 he was made Undersecretary of State for the Colonies. His most important                 position was as Minister Resident at the Allied                 Headquarters in the Mediterranean, in which                 position he served from 1942 to 1945, and during                 which time he became a good friend of General Dwight D. Eisenhower . After World War II he served as Secretary of State for Air in the                 caretaker government. \n Macmillan lost his Parliament                 seat in the 1945 General Election, but won a                 by-election to become MP for Bromley. From 1945                 to 1951 he was a leading member of the                 Opposition, speaking on economic and industrial                 issues and contributing to debates on foreign                 affairs. \n After the Conservatives                 regained Parliament in 1951, Macmillan was named                 Minister of Housing, and he served in that                 position until 1954. During his tenure he was                 responsible for the building of almost one                 million new homes throughout Britain. He                 subsequently served as Minister of Defense                 (1954-1955), Foreign Secretary (1955), and                 Chancellor of the Exchequer (1955-1957). \n Prime Minister \n When Egyptian President Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal in                 1956, Macmillan was one the \"war hawks\" in Parliament who initially backed Anthony Eden 's call for military action against                 Egypt. But when the United States and the United                 Nations reacted unfavorably to Britain's actions,                 Macmillan became one of those critical of how                 Eden had handled the situation. The incident led                 to Eden's resignation in January 1957. After                 consultation with Sir Winston Churchill and the                 Marquess of Salisbury, Queen                 Elizabeth II summoned                 Macmillan to succeed Eden on January 10, 1957. \n Macmillan quickly improved                 relations with the United States which had been                 strained by the Suez Crisis, as well as the                 confidence of the British people in its                 government. That increased confidence led to a                 greater Conservative majority coming out of the                 1959 General Election. Macmillan enjoyed some                 major successes during his time as Prime                 Minister, including the establishment of the                 National Economic Development Council and the                 signing of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty by the                 former Soviet Union, Great Britain, and the                 United States. But those successes were offset by                 some major failures. In 1961, Macmillan's push                 for Britain to apply for membership in the                 European Economic Community caused a split in the                 Conservative Party; to make the situation even                 worse, Britain's application was ultimately                 vetoed by France. In 1962, Macmillan tried to                 rebuild public confidence in his government by                 abruptly dismissing six cabinet members, but the                 move backfired. Public confidence was further                 eroded when it was disclosed that Foreign                 Secretary John Profumo had lied to Parliament                 about having an affair with a prostitute.                 Macmillan handled the scandal badly, and by 1963                 his government was in trouble. \n In October 1963, Macmillan fell ill and was                 hospitalized.

'And as I was under the water I was smiling to myself thinking, \"This is good, this is really good.\"' \n Gwen, who's sitting next to him, smiles and pats him on the knee. It's been a bit emotional all round. Duty Free only ran for two years, from 1984 to 1986, but was one of the biggest comedies of the decade, regularly attracting 12 million viewers. \n The show was a farce about two working-class Northerners, David and Amy Pearce, enjoying their first trip to Spain. There they meet posh Southerners, Robert and Linda Cochran, and David and Linda decide they're in love, mainly because he pretends to be a lot more worldly than he really is. \n There's lots of hiding in wardrobes and romantic interludes rudely interrupted, mostly by Amy who's determined to keep David from straying by constantly outwitting him. All the while Robert remains blissfully oblivious to the whole thing. \n RELATED ARTICLES \n Share this article \n Share \n The show's still regularly aired on various satellite channels, and Keith says he gets stopped at least four times a day by people who want to talk to him about it. 'And I'll get people in the supermarket joking, \"Are you going to pay for that in pesetas?\"' laughs Gwen. \n She says the show struck a chord with so many because the couple had the same flaws as real people. 'Women would stop me in the street and say, \"David's just like him\" about their husbands. \n The fibbing and the sucking in of the stomach when the ladies walked past, the pretending to be sophisticated with wine. Amy always knew that once she got him home he'd be back to normal - he'd just had his head turned. \n The thing about the show was it was always on the verge but you never saw any sort of sex. They were always thwarted by a donkey, or a monkey... but mainly by me.'  \n The original cast of Duty Free in 1984 Keith Barron, Gwen Taylor, Joanna Van Gyseghem and Neil Stacy \n Keith laughs and adds, 'Taxi drivers used to shout at me, \"Have you got your leg over yet?\" And I'd say \"No\" - we all knew if I got my leg over there'd be no show. It was all about the pursuit.' \n No wonder then - hot on the heels of the rejuvenated sitcom Birds Of A Feather - a new stage show is bringing Duty Free back to life. 'When they first approached me about it I thought, \"What took you so long?\"' says Keith, 79, who's been popping up in everything from DCI Banks to Benidorm ever since. 'We enjoyed the success of it so much. \n I just thought, \"I have to do it.\"' But Gwen, 75, who was given her own sitcom, Barbara, after Duty Free finished, almost turned it down. Joanna Van Gyseghem who played Linda, the object of David's affections, was unable to do it because she'd just become a grandmother to twins. \n But she's been replaced by Carol Royle while Neil Stacy returns as Robert.

Born in Florence, in 1540, after the death of his father, he was brought up   and trained in art by a close friend, often referred to as his 'uncle', the   mannerist painter Agnolo Bronzino, whose name he sometimes   assumed in his pictures. In some ways, Allori is the last of the line of   prominent Florentine painters, of generally undiluted Tuscan artistic heritage: Andrea del Sarto worked with Fra   Bartolomeo (as well as Leonardo Da Vinci), Pontormo briefly worked under Andrea, and trained Bronzino, who trained Allori.   Subsequent generations in the city would be strongly influenced by the tide of Baroque styles pre-eminent in other   parts of Italy. \n Among his collaborators was Giovanni Maria Butteri and his main   pupil was Giovanni   Bizzelli. Cristoforo del Altissimo, Cesare Dandini, Aurelio Lomi, John   Mosnier, Giovanni Battista Vanni, and Monanni also   were his pupils. Allori was one of   the artists, working under Vasari, included in the decoration of the Studiolo of   Francesco. \n Main Works \n Christ and the Samaritan Woman \n Road to Calvary \n Portrait of Piero de Médici \n Pearl Fishing \n The Miracle of St. Peter Walking on Water \n Venus and Cupid  1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Allori, Alessandro ...1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Allori, Alessandro - Wikisource, the free online library \n 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Allori, Alessandro \n 1196094 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica , Volume 1 — Allori, Alessandro \n ALLORI, ALESSANDRO (1535–1607), Italian painter of the Florentine school, was brought up and trained in art by his uncle, Angelo Bronzino (q.v.) whose name he sometimes assumed in his pictures. Visiting Rome in his nineteenth year, he carefully studied the works of Michelangelo; but the influence of that great master can only be traced in the anatomical correctness of his drawing of nude figures. He was successful as a portrait painter. His son Cristofano Allori (1577–1621), born at Florence, received his first lessons in painting from his father, but becoming dissatisfied with the hard anatomical drawing and cold colouring of the latter, he entered the studio of Gregorio Pagani (1558–1605) who was one of the leaders of that later Florentine school which endeavoured to unite the rich colouring of the Venetians with the correct drawing of Michelangelo's disciples. Allori became one of the foremost of this school. His pictures are distinguished by their close adherence to nature and the delicacy and technical perfection of their execution. His technical skill is proved by the fact that several copies he made after Correggio have been taken to be duplicates by Correggio himself. His extreme fastidiousness limited his power of production, though the number of his works is not so small as is sometimes asserted. Several specimens are to be seen at Florence and elsewhere. The finest of all his works is his “Judith and Holofernes,” in the Pitti Palace. The model for the Judith was his mistress, the beautiful Mazzafirra, who is also represented in his Magdalene; and the head of Holofernes is generally supposed to represent himself.

As would be expected,  most people were everyday folks – known only to friends, family and  their employers. Sort of like most people living their lives all around  the world today. But also, as would be expected, a small percentage of  these immigrants differentiated themselves from the teeming masses by  their remarkable accomplishments on the cultural and scientific  landscape. \n The first famous person to enter the United States via Ellis Island is famous by accident of position. This person is the very first person  to enter the country through the facility – Annie Moore. She arrived in  America in 1892 and will forever be known as the first person to pass  through the facility. Her fame of course is simply luck of the draw.  Anyone else who was in that position would have held the same fame. \n Another arrival in 1892 was not famous but had a famous son. Fritz  Austerlitz was the father of dance legend Fred Astaire – made famous in  several marvelous Hollywood classics like Finian’s Rainbow, Royal  Wedding, Funny Face, The Gay Divorcee and many others. Also arriving in  1892 were Antonius Dvorac – famous composer and Rudyard Kipling – writer  and poet best known for his work The Jungle Book. \n In 1897, Moses Teichman arrived. You probably do not know that name  but you most definitely know him under the name Arthur Murray – of the  Arthur Murray dance studios. Thanks to him, millions of people across  the globe now have access to standardized teaching of many of the  classic dances. \n Moving on to the fitness arena, we are all familiar with the famous  commercials of Angelo Siciliano – better known as Charles Atlas. Who can  forget the ads of the weak man getting sand kicked in his face and then  getting the Charles Atlas course to build up his muscles (and self  esteem.) Angelo arrived in America in 1903. A few years after him, in  1905, Johann Weissmuller (a.k.a. Johnny Weissmuller) arrived in America.  Johnny is best known as Tarzan but he was also an Olympian swimmer – having won five gold medals and one bronze medal in the 1920s. \n On the lighter side, Henry (Henny) Youngman arrived in 1906. He was a  famous comedian best known for his line: “Take my wife—please” a line  that is still often quoted today in comedic circles. Also in 1906, a  very special couple of famous Ellis Island immigrants arrived on the  shores of the United States – John and Mable Ringling – famous circus  owners and originators of the Ringling Brother’s circus that still  amuses and entertains millions every year. And lets not forget Arthur  Stanley Jefferson who arrived in 1912. He is loved and remembered for  his rule as Stan Laurel of the Laurel and Hardy show. In that very same  year, another comedic great came through Ellis Island. This was the year  Charles Chaplin arrived. Charlie Chaplin of course is still loved and  admired by many for his comedic films. \n Lest you think all the famous actors of that error who arrived  through Ellis Island were just comedic, you must consider who arrived in  1920. During this year, two enduring actors arrived. The first is Bela  Lugosi and the other is Archibald Alec Leach better known as Cary Grant. \n A few other famous Ellis Island immigrants who arrived during this  era include Harry Houdini in 1914, Walter Elias Disney (Walt Disney) in  1919 Albert Einstein in 1921, F. Scott Fitzgerald in 1921 and George  Gershwin in 1921. \n There are of course many other famous immigrants that arrived at  Ellis Island but even this short list shows the impact immigrants of  this era had on America and the world.

Between the cottage, the Museum and the Brig O'Doon we found many attractive vistas and photo opportunities. \n The world renowned Scottish Bard and Poet, Robert Burns, or Rabbie as he is more commonly known, was born in the wee whitewashed thatched cottage over 200 years ago and it was his formative years in Ayrshire that sowed the seeds of his literary talents. \n My visit to Burn's Cottage and the Museum was an ideal starting point for our family walking tour of Alloway. Along the route I popped into the grounds of the derelict old Church and graveyard that Burns wrote about in his poem Tam O'Shanter. It was a peaceful, yet surprisingly interesting place to explore, and again I snapped away with the camera. \n We used the free car park alongside the cottage and noted that there was a busy cafe in the small museum, where many original Burns artefacts are on display. Across the road from the cottage we spotted the village post office, which was teeming with visitors from a coach party. \n On exiting the Museum, we turned right and followed the Burns Heritage Trail down to the Tam O'Shanter Experience/Burns Heritage Park a five minute stroll away. Here we found a pleasant woodland tea garden where the children were able to run off some energy. It had a well stocked gift shop and cafe, and the auditorium showed a short film on the background of Rabbie Burns.

Sources vary in the canon of the Thunderbirds series as to John's age and birth date, although one written source suggests that he was born on 28 October 2041 - this would make him the third son. The majority of sources and two decades of Thunderbirds calendars cite John's birthday as 8 October and he is 25 years of age. Chris Bentley, author of 'The Complete Book Of Thunderbirds' erroneously cited Gerry Anderson as the source of the misinformation about the birth order of the Tracy brothers but later admitted that he was using the order of the brothers as shown in the credits. Most source books on Thunderbirds prior to the 'Complete' book noted that the birth order matches the number of the Thunderbirds ships, save that the third brother (John) and fifth brother (Alan) trade shifts aboard their respective crafts. Also, the novel 'Operation: Asteroids' from 1965 clearly states that Scott and Virgil are \"Jeff's eldest sons.\" \n John is a noted scholar of astronomy and has authored several popular astronomy textbooks. He is a graduate of Harvard University with a degree in Advanced Telecommunications.  \n   John's quiet intellectual nature and interest in astronomy make him the natural choice for the solitary life as the occupant of space station Thunderbird 5, monitoring for distress calls from around the world. He has only ever been seen physically involved in a rescue during the episode \"Danger At Ocean Deep,\" although he says at the end of that episode that he has already been on a \"dozen or so\" rescues. According to Carlton Books 'Lady Penelope's Secrets,' John is known to be exceedingly patient, kindly and gracious and possessed of both great intelligence and poise as gifts inherited from his talented mother. \n Thunderbirds 2004 film \n Lex Shrapnel portrayed John in the 2004 live action film.  However, due to the film focusing on Alan Tracy, not much is known about this version of John, except for the fact he's really fond of pizza, as revealed in the conversation scene between John and Jeff, before TB5 is shot by the Hood. \n Thunderbirds Are Go! \n In the 2015 series, John is still the 'pilot' of Thunderbird Five, but his role is greatly expanded beyond simply receiving calls for help, often providing aid in coordinating the rescue missions via long-distance communication. He is voiced by Thomas Brodie-Sangster. \n John is shown as being an emotional introvert, who prefers spending his spare time eating bagels, watching TV (his favourite show is Stingray) and stargazing. He is generally a loner, who doesn't like having to spend more time on Earth than he has to, as he's now the lone operator of TB5 until EOS comes, a program that he designed by himself.  Thunderbirds (TV series)Thunderbirds is a British science-fiction television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, filmed by their production company AP Films (APF) and distributed by ITC Entertainment.

{"question": "\"The Jacques Brel song \"\"Le moribond\"\" (translation \"\"the dying man\"\") was a hit in English for Terry Jacks under what title?\"", "answers": ["le moribond"], "context": "Seasons in the Sun by Terry Jacks - Song ... - SongfactsSeasons in the Sun by Terry Jacks Songfacts \n Seasons in the Sun by Terry Jacks Songfacts \n Songfacts \n Originally \"Le Moribond\" (\"The Dying Man\"), this was written and performed in French by the Belgian poet-composer Jacques Brel in 1961. The American poet Rod McKuen translated the lyrics to English, and in 1964 The Kingston Trio released the first English-language version of the song. This is the version Terry Jacks heard, which became the basis for his rendition. \n In our interview with Terry Jacks , he said that after his version was released, he had dinner in Brussels with Jacques Brel, who told him about writing the song. \"It was about an old man who was dying of a broken heart because his best friend was screwing his wife,\" Jacks said. \"He wrote this in a whorehouse in Tangiers, and the words were quite different. The song originally he used to do on stage and it was in a march form, like, 'Bom ba DUM, bom ba DUM.' Quite a different thing. This old man was dying of a broken heart and he was saying goodbye to his priest and his best friend and his wife, who cheated on him. Her name was Francoise, and it went, 'Adieu, Francoise, my trusted wife, without you I'd have had a lonely life. You cheated lots of times but then I forgave you in the end, though your lover was my friend.'\" \n The original version by Jacques Brel is rather macabre, but Jacks had an earnest inspiration for his reworking of the song: his good friend developed leukemia, and was given just six months to live. \"He was gone in four months,\" Jacks told us. \"He was a very good friend of mine, one of my best friends, and he said I was the first one that he told. I remembered this song of an old man dying of a broken heart, and I liked some of the melody and there was something there. I rewrote the song about him.\" \n Before releasing this song, Terry Jacks had considerable success in his native Canada as half of the duo The Poppy Family with his wife, Susan. He was friends with The Beach Boys, who asked him to produce a song for them - something Jacks was honored to do. Terry played them his arrangement of \"Seasons in the Sun\" and suggested they record it, since he thought it would sound great with their harmonies and with Carl Wilson singing lead. \n Terry flew to Brian Wilson's house and they began working on the song. Wilson had always been their producer, and could spend months working on a song if he wanted to perfect it. These were Terry's sessions, but Brian tried to take over. \n \"The thing never got finished,\" Jacks said in our interview. \"Brian wanted to get hold of the tape and add some things, and the engineer would have to take the tape home at night so that Brian wouldn't get hold of it. This went on and on, and I was almost having a nervous breakdown because I would put so much energy into this thing and the stress was really getting me. So I said, 'I'm not going to be able to finish this. I can't get you guys all in here together.' So it never got completed.\" \n The sessions weren't a complete wash for Jacks, however. He worked with Al Jardine on the backing vocals and came up with an arrangement he would use when he recorded the song himself. \n In 1973, the song was released as Jacks' second single (\"Concrete Sea\" was his first), and it was a huge hit, going to #1 in America for three weeks and also topping the UK chart. \n Terry released this on his own label, Goldfish Records, and was amazed when it became the largest-selling single in Canadian history: more than 285,000 copies sold in a matter of weeks.

Some 590 eligible visual artists were considered for the honour - about a fifth of whom are women. \n The list was considered by a Bank committee chaired by the Bank's deputy governor Ben Broadbent, and including chief cashier Victoria Cleland and independent experts Sir David Cannadine, Baroness Lola Young of Hornsey and Sandy Nairne. Three visual arts experts - John Akomfrah, Alice Rawsthorn, and Andrew Graham-Dixon - were also consulted. \n The committee drew up a shortlist of five - Turner, filmmaker Charlie Chaplin, sculptor Barbara Hepworth, painter William Hogarth, and designer Josiah Wedgwood. \n The final decision was made by the Bank's governor, Mark Carney. \n He said diversity was a consideration in the decision, and he admitted that \"further progress\" was needed on all measures of diversity when thinking about representation on banknotes. However, he said the process was more transparent and independent now. \n But Caroline Criado-Perez, whose campaign for more women to appear on banknotes was followed by the announcement of the Jane Austen £10 note design, said: \"Obviously it would be nice for it to have been a woman given women make up half the population, but I guess the Bank of England thinks one woman out of five historical figures ticks off their gender quota.\" \n 'Influence' \n Image caption Actor Timothy Spall played JMW Turner in the 2014 film Mr Turner \n Joseph Mallord William Turner, or JMW Turner (1775 - 1851), is known as \"the painter of light\" and described by artist Tracey Emin as a \"wild maverick\". \n Mr Carney, the Bank's governor, said: \"Turner is perhaps the single most influential British artist of all time. His work was transformative, bridging the classical and modern worlds. His influence spanned his lifetime and is still apparent today. \n \"I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all the people who got involved in the process and that sent us their suggestions for visual artists to celebrate. The range and breadth of these nominations is testament to the UK's achievements in the arts and the public's passion for it.\" \n The banknote features Turner's self-portrait, from 1799, currently on display in the Tate Britain, and one of his most eminent paintings - The Fighting Temeraire - which can be seen in the National Gallery.

Mount Baker \n Together with Mount Stanley and Mount Speke, Mount Baker forms a triangle creating the Bujuku Valley. Its height is 4,844 m. The area these mountains lay is locally known as the Mountains of the Moon. As with the vast majority of peaks in the Ruwenzori Range, Mt Bakers highest jagged ridge is known as Edward Peak. The mountain is named after Sir Samuel Baker who was an early in the region although never actually ascended the mountain himself. \n 4. Mount Speke \n Mt Speke is 4,890m and has several peaks including Vittorio Emanuele 4,890m; Ensonga 4,865m; Johnston 4,834m & Trident 4,572m. The people who live in the mountains call this mountain range the 'Rwenzori', 'the rain maker' in Swahili. Early explorers visited this region in search of the source of the River Nile and whilst the expedition leader John Speke didn’t climb this mountain he mapped the source of the White Nile in 1862. The mountains are blessed with a variety of wildlife due to the rivers and streams which criss-cross the mountain including elephant, chimpanzee, leopard, monkey & antelope. \n 3. Mount Stanley \n With an elevation of 5,109 m it's the highest mountain in both the DRC and Uganda and the third highest mountain on the continent after Mount Kenya and Mt Kilimanjaro. The peaks are actually high enough to support a glacier and it was named after explorer Sir Henry Morton Stanley. It's part of the UNESCO world heritage site that is Rwenzori Mountains National Park and was first summited in 1906 by Duke of the Abruzzi and his fellow climbers and was named Margherita Peak after the Queen Margherita of Italy. \n 2. Mt Kenya \n Mt Kenya is both the highest mountain in Kenya and the second highest mountain in Africa behind neighbouring Mt Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. Point Batian is 5,199m and the highest point on Mt Kenya. Mt Kenya is located in Central Kenya and runs right through the equator. It was established as a National Park in 1949 and then as a UNESCO site in 1997. There are a wide variety of animals that live lower down on the slopes of Mt Kenya including various species of monkey, antelope, porcupine and tree hyrax and some larger animals including both buffalo and elephant. \n 1. Mt Kilimanjaro \n Mt Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa standing at 5,895 metres above sea level and consists of three peaks, Shira, Kibo and Mawenzi with Uhuru peak being the highest on the Kibo crater rim. The mountains peak was reached for the first time in 1889 by Hans Meyer, a German geographer and Ludwig Purtscheller, an Austrian mountaineer. Since 1912, 80% of the Kibo glacier has disappeared due to the world's temperatures increasing, that's an annual loss of 1% and at its current rate Kilimanjaro is expected to be ice free between 2022 and 2033. \n Climbing Kilimanjaro is popular with climbers all over the world but the Tanzanian mountain rescue service are concerned by the fact many people believe it's an easy climb and end up paying the consequences further up the mountain for their naivety.

Eros (or the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain) \n February 2, 2011 \n Situated in the heart of Piccadilly Circus, the Eros statue has become an icon of London. Yet few of those who cluster around this iconic figurine realise that the aluminium statue (a rarity in itself) is actually a memorial, not to mention that it wasn’t intended to represent Eros at all. \n The monument – which also features a bronze fountain below – was erected in the late nineteenth century to commemorate Anthony Ashley-Cooper, the 7th Earl of Shaftesbury and a well-regarded Christian reformer and philanthropist of the Victorian era, and is formerly known as the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain. \n Designed by Alfred Gilbert and unveiled in 1893, the winged figure holding a bow was apparently actually intended to represent Eros’ brother, Anteros – a Greek god associated with selfless love as opposed to his brother Eros, who is associated with erotic love – and, according to some, bore the name The Angel of Christian Charity, which makes sense given the man whom it is intended to commemorate. \n While the statue attracted controversy when it was first unveiled thanks not least to its nudity, it has stood in Piccadilly Circus ever since (or at least mostly ever since – there have been a couple of brief periods such as when it was moved while Piccadilly Underground station was built and during World War II when it was moved for safe-keeping).

{"question": "Which Italian pasta's name means little spindles in English?", "answers": ["fusilli"], "context": "Pasta is Life | MacmillanPasta is Life | Macmillan \n Pasta is Life \n Tweet \n Food terms borrowed from other languages tend to arrive intact, or undergo as little change as possible to still be comprehensible in the second language. As well as providing novelty and diversion for menu readers, this practice can be a real boon to English learners. A stroll down the pasta aisle of the supermarket can provide an opportunity to expand your knowledge of several word families. Nearly all pasta terms used in English are unchanged from Italian; Italian is the purest descendant of Latin; and Latin is the gift that keeps on giving in English: some scholars estimate that as much as 70% of classical Latin has a residue in English in some form. \n It may surprise younger English speakers to learn that a concept like “pasta aisle” is actually a 20th-century development. Back in the day (that would be the 1950s or so) there was only spaghetti, macaroni, and perhaps lasagna on the shelves in many English-speaking countries, with no generic term to unite them. When more shapes of this “alimentary paste” (as the OED used to call it) began to turn up, the generic Italian term pasta gained currency in English. It’s unaltered from both Italian, where it means the same thing, and Latin, where it means “dough.” English relatives of the word include paste, pastry, and patisserie (a French loan word long at home in English). \n You don’t even need to don your etymology hat to spot that the pasta shape called radiatori look a bit like radiators or that spirali are spirals. But if you scratch the surface of many other pasta words you’ll find that they hook up with a family of related words in English all connected with objects from real life: plants, animals, or manufactured items. \n Take campanelle, for instance. These cone-shaped pasta shapes with a frilly edge look a little like a bell and a little like a flower. In fact they look like a bellflower, which in English is also called campanula. The word in Italian means “little bells.” The Latin ancestor of campanelle also gives us campanology (the art of bell-ringing), and campanile (a bell tower). \n Closer to the ground, you can examine vermicelli , (“little worms” in Italian), ultimately from Latin vermis, “worm.” This root has wormed its way into several English words, including the technical terms vermicular and vermiculate, as well as vermin . The English word worm is also distantly related to the Latin word. \n Various forms of roundness are a hallmark of pasta shapes. Names for them typically fall into one of three word families. In addition to spirali, noted above, there are fusilli, another kind of spiral-shaped pasta. The word ancestor of fusilli is Latin fusus, “spindle.” It turns up in English fuse and fusiform, “spindle-shaped.” Two other pasta shapes, rotelle “little wheels,” and rotini, another spiral-shaped pasta, carry the signature of Latin rota, “wheel,” a root that turns up unaltered in English rota as well as in rotate, rotary, and rotund. \n In the following table, each row has a blank. See if you can supply the missing word—pasta shape, a related English word, or core meaning—that connects the other two words.

But they are considered as one position. \n Five Ballet Feet Positions \n The positions of the feet in ballet is a fundamental part of classical ballet technique that defines proper placement of feet on the floor. There are five basic positions of the feet in modern-day classical ballet, known as the first through fifth positions. These five positions were codified by the dancing master Pierre Beauchamp in the late 17th century. \n Five Ballet Feet Positions \n Short and sweet, plus with the transitions from one position to another. Watch careful and enjoy! \n Feet positions: In all schools of ballet, there are five basic foot positions: first, second, third, fourth, fifth. All ballet movements begin or end in one of these five positions. Ballet dancers must have good natural turnout of the leg from their hip to enable them to stand in first position with the feet turned out to the sides. \n Thanks to the ROH Channel on YouTube. \n Watching the five ballet feet positions explained through video makes it easier for young students to learn them.

The Five Basic Positions of Ballet - BalletHubThe Five Basic Positions of Ballet - BalletHub \n The Five Basic Positions of Ballet \n Ballet Lesson \n BalletHub / Ballet Lessons / The Five Basic Positions of Ballet \n In classical ballet, there are five basic positions of both the feet and arms.  First, we’ll take a look at the five basic ballet positions of the feet.  The five basic positions are usually one of the first things taught in a beginner’s ballet class but are essential to the technique of classical ballet as practically every step begins and ends in one of the five basic positions. \n What are the Five Basic Positions of Ballet? \n The positions of the feet include first position, second position, third position, fourth position and fifth position.  There are also other basic ballet positions of the arms that can be combined with other beginner and advanced steps.  When a teacher asks “Start in First Position…” they are generally referring to the feet. \n First Position \n Possibly the easiest of the basic ballet positions is first position in ballet is a position of the feet where a dancer is standing with their heels together and toes facing equally out to either side.  For a beginner, its best just to think of the heels as needing to touch, but for more advanced dancers, no more than 2 inches should be between the heels.  Unless in a plié, the legs are straight.  The feet and legs should also be equally turned out. \n Read more about first position of the feet. \n Second Position \n Continuing with our ballet positions, we come to second position which is very similar to first, just with the feet about hip distance apart.  The same ideas as first position are true for second, where you want to have the feet and legs equally turned out.  Its important not to have your second position too wide that its not useful, or too narrow that it looks closer to a first position. \n Third Position \n Third position is very rarely done, though it still has a spot as one of the five basic ballet positions.  The reason it is not commonly used beyond a beginner level is that a third position can very easily look like a misplaced first or fifth position.  To do third position, simply start in first position, then move the heel of one of your feet to the", "parametric_answer": "5", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}
{"question": "What is the highest mountain in the world not in a mountain range?", "answers": ["kilimanjaro", "mount kilimanjaro"], "context": "Highest Mountains of the World - MountainProfessor.comHighest Mountains of the World \n Highest Mountains \n When we think of the highest mountains in the world, we usually think about elevation above sea level, and while this is primarily what we will deal with, it is noteworthy to understand that there are other ways to look at it -- like base to summit elevation, highest free-standing mountains, or the mountain peak that is closest to the moon and stars. \n So let's get this straight: What is the tallest mountain in the world? OK, when measured from sea level Mount Everest(29,035 ft; 8,849 m.) is the tallest and extends farthest into the atmosphere than any other peak in the world. \n However, the mountain peak that is closest to the moon and stars, is Mount Chimborazo (20,565 ft; 6,268 m.) in Ecuador. This is because the earth, its atmosphere and oceans bulge 26.5 miles at the equator, and Chimborazo sits higher up on the bulge than Everest, making it about 1.5 miles closer to the moon. \n Or another way to look at it is that Chimborazo is the farthest point from the earth's center, at 3,967.1 miles, while Everest is only 3,965.8 miles. \n OK, with all of that out of the way, where was I? Oh, yeah, so the highest \"free-standing\" mountain in the world is Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa, at 19,341 (5,895 m.) feet above sea level (ASL). \"Free-standing\" means it stands alone and is not part of a mountain range. Usually these are volcanic mountains. \n The tallest mountain when measured from its base is Mauna Kea in Hawaii, at over 33,000 feet (10,058 m.)-- however its base is many miles below the ocean surface, and only 13,796 feet (4,205 m.) of that is above sea level! \n Although Denali (Mount McKinley [20,320 ft; 6,193 m.]) has long been considered the mountain with the highest base-to-summit vertical rise above sea level at just over 18,000 feet, or 5,486 meters, recent evidence suggest that a peak in Pakistan's Karakoram Mountains known as Rakaposhi, at 25,551 ft (7,788m) has an even greater vertical rise. On the north side it rises 19,029 ft (5,800 m.) in only 7.1 miles from its immediate base! \n What about the highest mountains in the solar system?

This funded his greater ambitions as a novelist, and in 1975 he struck gold with The Death of Reginald Perrin, in which office politics and meeting-filled drudgery at Sunshine Desserts make Reggie Perrin so fear that “his past was his future’s jailer” that he fakes suicide and assumes a fresh identity. A much-loved television adaptation, The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, starring Leonard Rossiter as Perrin and Pauline Yates as his long-suffering wife, Elizabeth, ran between 1976 and 1979, and Nobbs embarked on a series of sometimes interconnected novels and scripts chronicling changes to British life across the decades. \n David Nobbs, Reginald Perrin creator, dies at 80 \n Read more \n His own identity as a comedy writer came from living on the edge of things. He was born in Petts Wood, near Orpington, Kent, only child of Gordon, a teacher at the City of London school, and his wife, Gwen, a former teacher. His father’s school was evacuated during the second world war to Marlborough college. Nobbs became steeped in cricket, the adventure stories of WE Johns and Arthur Ransome , and Dick Barton , and began writing. He recalled: “By the time I was 10 or 11 my sense of humour seemed suddenly to have come to life … we were a very close-knit family as we listened to a whole succession of radio shows. We never mentioned love and affection. Our shared laughter round the snug coal fire spoke of these things for us.” \n After four years at Bickley Hall preparatory school, at some financial sacrifice by his parents Nobbs was sent to Marlborough, where he relished Aristophanes (in the original), Waugh, Wodehouse, and Peter Ustinov and Peter Jones ’s radio comedy sketches in In All Directions. Aged 14 he was raped by an older boy, which he said left him “distressed rather than traumatised”. He speculated that it was a cause of sexual confusion for him in later life. \n After his national service, he went to St John’s, Cambridge, to read classics, although he soon changed to English. He wrote for Varsity and Granta magazines, and his sketches were accepted for Footlights. On graduation in 1958, he joined the Sheffield Star as an apprentice journalist, and met Peter Tinniswood , with whom he would later form a writing partnership. However, he realised newspapers were not his future after missing a scoop about a shootout. He and Tinniswood preferred discussing their writing. \n Pinterest \n Pauline Yates, Leonard Rossiter and Sally-Jane Spencer in The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin.

Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground; but the dove found no place to set her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put forth his hand and took her and brought her into the ark with him. He waited another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; and the dove came back to him in the evening, and lo, in her mouth a freshly plucked olive leaf; so Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth. Then he waited another seven days, and sent forth the dove; and she did not return to him any more. (Genesis 8:6-12 RSV) \n What shall we make of this strange story of the raven and the dove? They are clearly symbolical, even though also historical: \n The raven is listed in Leviticus as one of the unclean birds, forbidden to the Jewish people to eat. It is the first bird that is released from the ark. According to the Hebrew it flew to and fro, never returning to the ark, evidently feeding upon carrion and resting upon floating carcasses that were there in abundance during the Flood. \n As the account makes clear, the raven is no help to Noah whatsoever. The release of the raven tells him nothing about the condition of earth. Noah sees it flying to and fro above the waters, seemingly quite satisfied with the conditions it finds. It does not return to the ark but rests upon floating carcasses and feeds upon them. \n The dove, on the other hand, is a clean bird. It did not fly abroad and remain, but returned to the ark. It rested only in the ark until a new world was ready for it: On its last return it brought an olive leaf in its bill as a symbol of life and peace. \n Now what does this all mean? It clearly pictures facts with which we daily must relate. In our present life, according to the Scriptures, though we are redeemed, there are two natures present within us. One is truly ours; the other is an imposter which is no longer ours, as Paul puts it in Romans 7, but with which we must contend until we are released from its presence by the resurrection of the body. \n One is called \"the flesh\" and the other \"the spirit.\" The whole struggle of the spiritual life arises out of the conflict of the flesh with the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh. One is evil, unclean; the other is clean, and good. These are symbolized by these two birds.

{"question": "What name is given to a painful infection of the tip of a finger?", "answers": ["whitlow"], "context": "Felon Guide: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment OptionsFelon Guide: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment Options \n Felon \n What Is It? \n An infection inside the tip of the finger can form an enclosed pocket of pus (or abscess) that is very painful as it expands. A felon is a fingertip abscess deep in the palm side of the finger. It usually is caused by bacterial infection, but a herpes virus called herpetic whitlow and, more rarely, fungi also can cause felons. \n Felons usually are caused by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. It is important to get treatment quickly for these small abscesses. If the bacteria pocket continues to expand, it can compress blood vessels in the finger and cut off the fingertip's circulation, causing in permanent damage to the finger. Also, an untreated felon can spread its infection to the bone within the finger. This can lead to a more serious infection, called osteomyelitis, which takes much longer to cure. \n Like other types of infections, felons sometimes begin after the finger is punctured by a wood splinter or something else. \n Symptoms \n A felon causes extreme pain at the fingertip, especially when pressure is applied to the \"fingerprint\" surface. The end of the finger swells, is warm and turns red. There may be an accumulation of a white, thick discharge (pus). As the felon increases, the fingertip may feel numb, and bending the finger may be painful. \n Diagnosis \n Your doctor can usually diagnose a felon just by examining it. He or she will ask whether you have had an injury in the area. Tenderness, redness, firmness and enlargement of the fingertip are all signs of a felon. If you have small bubble-like cysts on the skin, called vesicles, and repeated episodes, it is likely the cause is herpetic whitlow. \n Expected Duration \n Because an enlarging abscess in the finger reduces blood supply into the area, it is hard for your body's immune system to fight this type of infection. Felons almost always need to be opened and drained by a doctor before they can heal. Most clear up within days to weeks. Healing may be faster with aggressive treatment. \n Prevention \n If you are going to work with wood or other materials that could cause splinters, wear protective gloves. People with diabetes who prick their fingers for home blood tests should first wash the fingertip with alcohol. Avoiding contact with others who have herpes may prevent herpetic infections, though there may be no way to know in advance who has the infection. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of a herpetic infection may prevent complications. \n Treatment \n Except for infections related to herpes, felons are treated with a minor surgery to allow drainage. Typically, your doctor will make the whole finger numb by injecting an anesthetic once into each side of your finger, just beyond the knuckle of the hand. Then he or she will make one or more small cuts in the tip of your finger to allow the pus to drain out. A narrow gauze strip may be left in the wound to hold it open for continued drainage. The gauze may need to be replaced every day or two as it absorbs bacteria and debris from inside the wound. \n A doctor usually will prescribe antibiotics that work against \"staph\" bacteria infections. Antibiotics may be changed if the infection does not clear up promptly or if testing of the pus indicates that the infection is caused by an unusual organism or one that is resistant to the usual antibiotics.  For severe cases, a more extensive operation may be necessary including making a small hole in the nail to allow additional drainage. \n If the infection is due to herpes, drainage is not performed because it may delay healing or increase the risk of bacterial infection. Herpes infections in the finger tend to clear up on their own, although antiviral medication (such as Zovirax ) often is prescribed as well. \n If you have this or any skin or wound infection, make sure you are up-to-date with your tetanus vaccinations. \n When To Call A Professional \n Because of the complications that can occur from a felon, you should see your doctor and go", "parametric_answer": "paronychia", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

Protesters called for another night of defiance against the Arab world's longest-serving leader despite a crackdown. \n ( Scroll down for latest updates ) \n At sunset, pro-Gadhafi militia drove around Tripoli with loudspeakers and told people not to leave their homes, witnesses said, as security forces sought to keep the unrest that swept eastern parts of the country - leaving the second-largest city of Benghazi in protesters' control - from overwhelming the capital of 2 million people. \n State TV said the military had \"stormed the hideouts of saboteurs\" and urged the public to back security forces. Protesters called for a demonstration in Tripoli's central Green Square and in front of Gadhafi's residence, but witnesses in various neighborhoods described a scene of intimidation: helicopters hovering above the main seaside boulevard and pro-Gadhafi gunmen firing from moving cars and even shooting at the facades of homes to terrify the population. \n Youths trying to gather in the streets were forced to scatter and run for cover by the gunfire, said one witness, who like many reached in Tripoli by The Associated Press spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. \n Gadhafi, whose whereabouts were not known, appeared to have lost the support of at least one major tribe, several military units and his own diplomats, including the delegation to the United Nations.

The Monkees were formed in 1965 in Los Angeles, California and disbanded in 1970. Several reunions of the original lineup have taken place. The first reunion lasted from 1986-1989, and a second regrouping took place between 1996-1997. The Monkees last worked together for a brief period in 2001 . \n Contents \n 9 External links \n History of the series \n The television show first aired on September 12, 1966 on the American NBC television network and lasted for two seasons; its final primetime episode ran on September 9, 1968. Modeled on the Beatles ' film A Hard Day's Night , The Monkees featured the antics and music of a fictional pop-rock group which, due to the necessities of the program and the massive success of the records, became a real pop-rock group. \n The four young men who became The Monkees were British-born David ('Davy') Jones (percussion/vocals), George Michael ('Micky') Dolenz (drums/vocals), Michael Nesmith (guitar/vocals), and Peter Tork (bass/keyboards/vocals). They were cast after ads were placed in trade publications calling for actors to play '4 insane boys' on a new television series. 437 hopeful actors and musicians auditioned for the parts; a then relatively unknown Stephen Stills was shortlisted for a role, but was eventually knocked out because of his bad teeth, with Peter Tork finally winning the role Stills had hoped to get. Rumors have circulated that Charles Manson also auditioned, but these rumors have been shown to be false. \n Nesmith and Tork were both already professional musicians, but Dolenz and Jones were better known as actors. All four were trained in both improvisational comedy and performing musically as a group before the pilot episode was filmed, so that they could look and act like a cohesive band even though it was only their voices being used on the initial recordings. \n As a television show, The Monkees used techniques rarely seen on television—characters breaking the fourth wall and talking to the camera and sometimes even to people off-camera in the studio, fantasy sequences, jump cuts, and at least once a week a musical romp which might have nothing to do with the story line.

The show was produced by Bert Schneider and Bob Rafelson , who later produced the film Easy Rider  ; Rafelson went on to direct such films as Five Easy Pieces and The King of Marvin Gardens.

The film, created and edited in a stream of consciousness style, featured cameo appearances by movie star Victor Mature and musician Frank Zappa . It was not a commercial success.

Queen Elizabeth II, who made no qualms about not being a tennis fan, was making only her second ever appearance at Centre Court when Wade met Betty Stove of the Netherlands for the championship. “If she’s [Queen Elizabeth II] going to be there, I am going to be there too,” Wade said. \n Wade, then 31, and singles champion at the US Open in 1968 and at the Australian Open in 1972, wore a beautiful pink cardigan as she arrived on court. After dropping the first set 4-6, her whole demeanor turned a fiery red in winning the final two sets convincingly, 6-3, 6-1. Wade, who was playing in her 17th of an all-time record 26 Wimbledons, upset No. 1 seed Chris Evert, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, in the semifinals to reach her one and only final. Once she settled into a groove after the first set, her precise groundstrokes controlled the match. “Winning Wimbledon was the thing that made my career worthwhile,” Wade told the Guardian in 1977. Those in attendance witnessed Queen Elizabeth II present Wade with championship trophy and then sang a rendition of “For She’s a Jolly Good Fellow” to celebrate the victory. \n With her victory in London, Wade held the distinction of being the last Brit to win Wimbledon until Andy Murray in 2013. Her winnings were $20,499, compared to today’s multi-million dollar purse. In an interview with the Independent in 2007, Wade joked that her Wimbledon title came right on schedule. “Well, Angela Mortimer had won in 1961 and Ann Jones in 1969, so when I won in 1977 we all thought it happened every eight years, but maybe we were just anomalies, because there was Sue Barker and Joe Durie, but then the [British] players just petered out.” \n Wade was a lithe 5-foot-8 steady stroke machine who had a beautiful all-court game built on a smooth slice backhand and a forehand that she could hit with topspin or flat. Wade was a thinker between the lines; her shots were patient and calculated. She was adept at controlling tempo and wouldn’t be forced into foolish shots. She would pause a minimum of five seconds before releasing her serve after getting into the ready position and hopped into position to move laterally or take a short ball and attack the net. \n In her lengthy 26-year career, Wade won 55 singles titles, eighth on the all-time list. She favored playing at Wimbledon and the US Open the most of any of the four majors. As a 23-year old in 1968, she won the inaugural US Open, doing so as the No. 6 seed with a stunning and unexpected 6-4, 6-2 victory over No. 1 seed Billie Jean King. It was Wade’s fifth trip to the US major and although she would play the event another 15 times, her best finishes afterward were the semifinals in 1969, 1970, and 1975. The 1968 victory earned her $6,000. Wade only traveled to the Australian Open five times, but in 1972 stung another No. 1 seed when defeating crowd favorite and native Evonne Goolagong, who was in the midst of playing in seven consecutive Australian finals,", "parametric_answer": "angela mortimer", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

He sat down and wrote immediately to the BBC. That letter reached the in-tray of the BBC’s Head of Popular Record Programmes, Leslie Perowne. The pitch was successful and a broadcasting institution was born. \n That first Desert Island Discs was recorded in the BBC’s bomb-damaged Maida Vale studio on 27th January 1942 and aired in the Forces Programme at 8pm two days later. It was introduced to the listening public as \"a programme in which a well-known person is asked the question, if you were to be cast away alone on a desert island, which eight gramophone records would you choose to have with you, assuming of course, that you had a gramophone and an inexhaustible supply of needles\". \n Plomley’s first castaway was the popular Viennese comedian, actor and musician, Vic Oliver. The first piece of music chosen by Vic Oliver, and therefore by any castaway, was Chopin’s Étude No.12 in C minor played by pianist Alfred Cortot. During these war years, every BBC Radio show was scripted and Plomley and his guests would 'read' their conversations. On 7th May 1942 Roy Plomley made his first appearance as a castaway when the programme was presented by Leslie Perowne. \n The programme came off air in 1946 returning to the Home Service in 1951. On 16th September that year, the choice of luxury was introduced when garlic was chosen by the actress Sally Ann Howes. The choice of book made its first appearance on 9th October 1951 when actor and director Henry Kendall chose Who’s Who in the Theatre. According to Roy Plomley’s book, Desert Island Lists, in addition to the volume of Shakespeare, the castaways would be given a copy of the Bible, which was assumed to have been deposited there by The Gideon Society. \n In September 1967, Desert Island Discs transferred to the newly created Radio 4 service. Roy Plomley continued to present the programme until his death, from pleurisy, in May 1985. He was 71. He was replaced by Michael Parkinson who dispensed with the ritual of the pre-recording lunch at Plomley’s club, the Garrick, and insisted that the music was played to the guests during the recording rather than edited in afterwards. Parkinson presented the last of his 96 programmes on 13th March 1988, when his guest was the athlete Brendan Foster. \n Sue Lawley became the first female presenter and over the following 18 years, Lawley, a former Nationwide presenter, interviewed 750 people from all aspects of public life including politics, entertainment, science and sport. Describing the role as “one of the best jobs in broadcasting”, Lawley left Desert Island Discs in August 2006 and was replaced by journalist and broadcaster, Kirsty Young. During her tenure in the chair the programme has become available to listen again online and is available as a download.

The panel consisted of the show's deviser, Graeme Garden, alongside Bill Oddie, Jo Kendall and Tim Brooke-Taylor. From the start, Clue's zany humour delighted listeners. Initial research revealed audience reactions such as 'teams were talented and amusing... an exceptionally fine quiz master - witty, relaxed and a good match for the teams.' One listener, however, complained that he 'hadn't a clue what it was all about' which, given the eventual title of the show, was perhaps an endorsement!   The show's many years on air testify to its appeal, which owes much to the wit of the chairman, Humphrey Lyttelton. Humph, as he was affectionately known, was educated at Eton, and he trained at art college before joining the Daily Mail as a cartoonist. An ex-Grenadier Guardsman trumpeter, his reputation as a jazz player was legendary.   The regular members of the panel - Tim Brooke-Taylor, Barry Cryer, Graeme Garden and, until his untimely death in December 1996, Willie Rushton - formed a perfect comic quartet. Tim and Graeme previously worked together on I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again, the forerunner of I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue, whilst Barry and Tim appeared together on radio and television in Hello Cheeky. Their wholehearted enthusiasm for such games as Tag Wrestling, Wuthering Hillocks and Cheddar Gorge ensures constant hilarity on the panel and in the studio audience.   Of course, the best-known game of all is Mornington Crescent, whose rules have eluded and baffled listeners for years. Other highlights include the lovely Samantha, and Colin Sell at the piano - who, according to Humph, is about to complete his latest album: 'All he needs is the latest set of prints back from Snappy-Snaps...' Humphrey Lyttelton, broadcaster, musician, presenter and master of the double entendre, died on 25 April 2008. After a long and understandable break, Radio 4's antidote to panel games returned on 15 June 2009 for its 51st series. Stephen Fry, Jack Dee and Rob Brydon took it in turns to keep some kind of order, as they chaired this new series without the much-missed Humph, and later the same year Jack Dee took over as the regular host.

Some online literary forums even discuss the possibility of Shakespeare being born in Messina, Sicily, under the name of ‘Crollalanza’. A rather cute theory. \n Shakespeare set fifteen of his thirty-seven plays in and around Italy, and in many cases the titles can be seen as a satiric comment on the location. Comedy of Errors takes place in Syracusa. Messina diverts with Much Ado about Nothing. In Naples we face The Tempest. Rome takes the imperial lead with Coriolanus, Julius Caesar, and Titus Andronicus. Siena, Pisa and Florence appear in All’s Well that Ends Well. Mantua and Verona are home to heartbreak and infidelity in Romeo and Juliet and The Two Gentlemen of Verona. Padua handles The Taming of the Shrew.  And Venice is home for justice and betrayal in The Merchant of Venice and Othello. \n The locations spice up the plays and vice versa. I wouldn’t mind going on an itinerary looking for old-school drama. Could be fun to see dramatic actor guides impersonate Shylock on the Rialto Bridge in Venice where dramatic actor guides impersonate Shylock. Hearn Romeo’s words echo inside and outside of Verona walls.

H. | Middle School Teacher | (Level 3) Educator Emeritus \n Posted on \n July 15, 2012 at 6:14 AM \n It is speculated that when Shakespeare set Much Ado About Nothing in Messina, he was actually thinking of Venice, which was one of the most corrupt cities of his time period ( \"The Artificiality of Messinian Society,\" eNotes ). Venice was extremely wealthy as they had a monopoly over trade in China due to the success of the Venetian explorer, Marco Polo, who opened trade routes between Beijing and Europe. Due to the city's wealth, the city's wealthy families were constantly competing with each other for grander palaces and more power. The city's wealthy also ruled the government. Venice was called a republic, however, the Great Council ruled the city, which consisted of the wealthiest and most influential families of Venice. The Great Council selected all public officials, including the Senate body, who elected the Council of Ten. The Council of Ten where the highest administrators and made decisions for the city in secret ( \"Venice During the Renaissance\" ). Hence, since Venice was really a wealthy totalitarian city who passed itself off as a republic, we can see that Venice was extremely corrupt and embodied the theme of appearances vs. reality that dominates Shakespeare's play. \n Dogberry actually expresses this theme very well when he lists his attributes, which are his position of power, his wealth, and his beauty, which we see in his lines: \n I am a wise fellow; and which is more, an officer; and which is more, a householder, and which is more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in Messina, and one that knows the law, go to! and a rich fellow enough, go to!", "parametric_answer": "comedy of errors", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

However, in June 1999 Peel Holdings purchased the site with the view to turning it into a commercial airport serving 2.3m passengers and 62,000 tonnes of freight. \n Because of the excellent quality of the infrastructure already in place � the airport has one of the longest runways in the north of England � Robin Hood Airport has the capacity to handle charter, scheduled, long-haul, freight, general and business aviation internationally. \n The development of Robin Hood Airport will ensure that the spirit and history of RAF Finningley lives on long into the future. \n Robin Hood Airport \n Hayfield Lane, Doncaster Finningley Airport, \n Doncaster  Doncaster Robin Hood - Danum PhotosDoncaster Robin Hood \n Doncaster Robin Hood \n Doncaser Jazz Festival \n Doncaster Sheffield             Robin Hood Airport opened for             business in April 2005 and flies             holiday-makers from South Yorkshire             and beyond area to Europe and             beyond.

{"question": "What name is shared by a former Manchester City FC manager (1965-1971) and a champion flat jockey who used to ride for the Queen?", "answers": ["joe mercer"], "context": "Manchester City F.C.Manchester City Football Club is a football club in Manchester, England. Founded in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton), they became Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. The club moved to the City of Manchester Stadium in 2003, having played at Maine Road since 1923. \n The club's most successful period was in the late 1960s and early 1970s when they won the League Championship, FA Cup, League Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup under the management team of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the 1981 FA Cup Final, the club went through a period of decline, culminating in relegation to the third tier of English football for the only time in their history in 1998. Having regained their Premier League status in the early 2000s, the club was purchased in 2008 by Abu Dhabi United Group and has become one of the wealthiest in the world. Since 2011 the club have won six major honours, including the Premier League in 2012 and 2014. \n By 2014–15, Manchester City had the sixth-highest revenue in the footballing world with an annual revenue of €463.5 million.  In 2016, Forbes magazine estimated they were the world's sixth most valuable football club, worth $1.92 billion.  \n History  \n City gained their first honours by winning the Second Division in 1899; with it came promotion to the highest level in English football, the First Division. They went on to claim their first major honour on 23 April 1904, beating Bolton Wanderers 1–0 at Crystal Palace to win the FA Cup; City narrowly missed out on a League and Cup double that season after finishing runners-up in the League but City became the first club in Manchester to win a major honour.  \n In the seasons following the FA Cup triumph, the club was dogged by allegations of financial irregularities, culminating in the suspension of seventeen players in 1906, including captain Billy Meredith, who subsequently moved across town to Manchester United.  A fire at Hyde Road destroyed the main stand in 1920, and in 1923 the club moved to their new purpose-built stadium at Maine Road in Moss Side.  \n In the 1930s, Manchester City reached two consecutive FA Cup finals, losing to Everton in 1933, before claiming the Cup by beating Portsmouth in 1934.  During the 1934 cup run, Manchester City broke the record for the highest home attendance of any club in English football history, as 84,569 fans packed Maine Road for a sixth round FA Cup tie against Stoke City in 1934 – a record which still stands to this day.  The club won the First Division title for the first time in 1937, but were relegated the following season, despite scoring more goals than any other team in the division.  Twenty years later, a City team inspired by a tactical system known as the Revie Plan reached consecutive FA Cup finals again, in 1955 and 1956; just as in the 1930s, they lost the first one, to Newcastle United, and won the second. The 1956 final, in which Manchester City beat Birmingham City 3–1, is one of the most famous finals of all-time, and is remembered for City goalkeeper Bert Trautmann continuing to play on after unknowingly breaking his neck.  \n After relegation to the Second Division in 1963, the future looked bleak with a record low home attendance of 8,015 against Swindon Town in January 1965.  In the summer of 1965, the management team of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison was appointed. In the first season under Mercer, City won the Second Division title and made important signings in Mike Summerbee and Colin Bell.  Two seasons later, in 1967–68, Manchester City claimed the League Championship for the second time, clinching the title on the final day of the season with a 4–3 win at Newcastle United and beating their close neighbours Manchester United into second place.  Further trophies followed: City won the FA Cup in 1969, before achieving European success by winning the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1970, beating Górnik Zabrze 2–1 in Vienna.

The band eventually fell apart in 1983, after which Sharkey teamed up with Vince Clarke in the short-lived Assembly. The plaintive Never Never was a Top 5 hit for the duo and highlighted the power of Sharkeys distinctive, quavering vocal style. In 1984, Sharkey recorded the underrated Listen To Your Father for Madness label Zarjazz and this was followed in 1985 by his biggest success, A Good Heart. This insistent tune, written by Maria McKee, established him as a potential major act by reaching number 1 in the UK charts.

Since moving away from performing in the early 1990s, he has performed various roles supporting the UK's commercial music industry, winning several awards and honours for his work in that area. Sharkey, who was born in Derry, Northern Ireland, was a co-founder of The Undertones at their inception in 1976. In the 1970s they played in many locations throughout Northern Ireland, including the Flamingo Ballroom in Ballymena and Chester's in Portrush. The Undertones had several UK hits with songs such as \"Teenage Kicks\", \"Here Comes The Summer\", \"My Perfect Cousin\", \"Wednesday Week\" and \"It's Going To Happen\". The band split in 1983 citing musical differences, with Sharkey pursuing a solo career and other members of the band forming That Petrol Emotion the following year. Before his solo career took off, he was also the singer of the one-shot group The Assembly with ex- Yazoo and Depeche Mode member Vince Clarke (pre-Erasure). In 1983 their single \"Never Never\" was a UK No. 4 hit.

Surfing and the Beach Boys? Hollywood and Governor Schwarzenegger? The University of California at Berkeley has ensured that California also has its place in the periodic table with element 98, the tenth of the actinides, californium. \n Although it seems perfectly sensible to celebrate the location where it was discovered, californium's name was, in fact, a failure for the team behind its production. Glen T. Seaborg and his co-workers had named americium to parallel the lanthanide above it in the periodic table, europium. They went on to name curium and berkelium in a way that was also derived from the equivalent lanthanide. So, for instance, the actinide berkelium was named after Berkeley because the lanthanide above it, terbium, was named after the Swedish village Ytterby where it was quarried. \n When it came to californium, an artificial element first produced in 1950, the equivalent lanthanide would be dysprosium, which comes from the Greek for 'hard to get.' After some head-scratching, Seaborg and his team gave up on the search for an equivalent and just went for the location of the lab. They had already discarded a list of names including cyclotronium and cyclonium, after the device used in producing the first californium, along with the more than a little cheesy radlabium, reflecting the team's origins as part of the radiation laboratory or rad lab. \n They did, though, manage a neat bit of rationalization, arguing that they paralleled dysprosium's 'hard to get' meaning because 'the searchers for another element a century ago found it difficult to get to California.' This referred to the state's inaccessibility during the nineteenth century gold rush. \n The first isotope of californium produced was californium 245, with a half life of just 44 minutes. The team battered a target of curium with alpha particles using a cyclotron, an early type of particle accelerator still in use today, particularly in medical applications. The cyclotron accelerates charged particles using electrodes that switch rapidly between attracting and repelling as the particles spiral around a circular chamber until they collide with a target. In this case the collision produced californium and a spare neutron. \n The most stable of californium's 20 or so produced isotopes is californium 251, which has a half life of 898 years, though many of the isotopes have half-lives measured in minutes. It's most often made now by starting with berkelium 249 and adding neutrons in a nuclear reactor. Although this is a purely artificial element here on earth, it may exist in space as one of the many by-products of supernovas. \n When it comes to practical uses, this slivery substance is an excellent neutron emitter. This makes it handy for kick-starting nuclear reactors, where a high neutron flow is required to get the chain reaction going. It also means that, in principle, californium would make effective small scale nuclear weapons, requiring as little as five kilograms of californium 251 to achieve critical mass - about half the amount of plutonium required for a bomb - but in practice it is so fiddly to produce that even at this scale it is unlikely to be used. \n As well as providing the starter for reactors, small amounts of californium have also found their way into a number of devices requiring a flow of neutrons, whether it is specialist detectors or radiotherapy, as a last resort for some cancer treatments where gentler sources have failed. \n Perhaps californium's most common application is in moisture gauges used in potential oil wells. These detectors fire fast neutrons through the material to be tested. Hydrogen nuclei, typical of those in water and oil, tend to slow down the neutrons, so a slow neutron detector can be used to search for telltale hydrogen.

Eisner made it clear that this revolution was different from the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and announced that all private property would be protected by the new government.On 9th November, 1918, Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated and the Chancellor, Max von Baden, handed power over to Friedrich Ebert, the leader of the German Social Democrat Party.In Bavaia Kurt Eisner formed a coalition with the German Social Democrat Party in the National Assembly. Eisner's rule was short-lived as he was assassinated by Anton Graf Arco, a fanatical nationalist, on 21st February, 1919. \n Fearing a counter-revolution, supporters of Eisner established Soldiers' and Workers' Councils and took over the government from the National Assembly. Eugen Levine, a member of the German Communist Party (KPD), became the new leader of the Bavarian Republic.Inspired by the events of the October Revolution, Levine ordered the expropriated of luxury flats and gave them to the homeless. Factories were to be run by joint councils of workers and owners and workers' control of industry and plans were made to abolish paper money.

By 13th January the rebellion had been crushed and its leaders, including Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht and Leo Jogiches had been captured and executed.With Freikorps units massing on Bavaria's northern borders, the Red Guards began arresting people they considered to be hostile to the new regime.

Their cell walls are more or less rigid and support both the individual cells and the whole structure. Even when plants have reached what we regard as their full, mature size, they continue to expand and develop new leaves, flowers, fruit and shoots. \n Unlike animals, plants cannot move when the environment changes. They are at the mercy of the climate and the gardener because they are rooted in place. Even though it appears that many plants, especially larger ones, are quite tolerant of change, they sometimes do not show adverse effects until long after the event. For example, tree roots are often damaged or killed by suffocation during building projects or flooding. An established tree may still have strength to leaf out and may appear to thrive for several years. But in its weakened state, the tree is more likely to blow down, become infested or simply decline. \n To understand why plants respond as they do to natural influences and to cultivation, gardeners must understand something about their structure and how they grow. This publication provides such an introduction. \n Ways to group plants \n Uses \n Gardeners tend to group plants by their horticultural uses: fruits, vegetables, flowers, trees, shrubs, turf and so on. These categories are a convenient way to think and learn about plants. \n Life cycle \n Plants can also be categorized by the length of their life cycles. Annual, biennial and perennial are terms that describe how long a plant will live and also indicate when it is likely to bloom. \n Annual \n An annual plant's entire life cycle from seed germination to seed production occurs in one growing season, and then the plant dies. Many flowering plants that we consider to be annuals are not annuals in their native habitats. They would continue to grow and flower in future years if freezing temperatures did not kill them. Tuberous begonia (Begonia × tuberhybrida) is an example of an ornamental plant treated as an annual in the Midwest, although it is a perennial in the southern states. \n Annuals may be further subdivided into summer and winter annuals: \n Winter annuals begin their life cycle in late summer or fall, survive in the vegetative state through winter, and then flower quickly in the spring before dying. \n Summer annuals begin their life cycle in spring or summer and complete their entire life cycle before fall or winter. \n Biennial \n A biennial plant starts from seed and produces vegetative structures and food storage organs in its first full season.

The Commonwealth operates by intergovernmental consensus of the member states, organised through the Commonwealth Secretariat, and non-governmental organisations, organised through the Commonwealth Foundation.  \n The Commonwealth dates back to the mid-20th century with the decolonisation of the British Empire through increased self-governance of its territories. It was formally constituted by the London Declaration in 1949, which established the member states as \"free and equal\".  The symbol of this free association is Queen Elizabeth II who is the Head of the Commonwealth. The Queen is also the monarch of 16 members of the Commonwealth, known as Commonwealth realms. The other Commonwealth members have different heads of state: 32 members are republics and five are monarchies with a different monarch. \n Member states have no legal obligation to one another. Instead, they are united by language, history, culture and their shared values of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. These values are enshrined in the Commonwealth Charter and promoted by the quadrennial Commonwealth Games. On 3 October 2013, after 48 years of membership, The Gambia became the most recent nation to withdraw from the Commonwealth.  \n The Commonwealth covers more than 29958050 km2, almost a quarter of the world's land area, and spans all six inhabited continents. With an estimated population of 2.328 billion, nearly a third of the world population,  the Commonwealth in 2014 produced a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of $10.45 trillion, representing 17% of the gross world product when measured in purchasing power parity (PPP) and 14% of the gross world product when measured nominally. \n History \n Origin \n Queen Elizabeth II, in her address to Canada on Dominion Day in 1959, pointed out that the confederation of Canada on 1 July 1867 had been the birth of the \"first independent country within the British Empire\". She declared: \"So, it also marks the beginning of that free association of independent states which is now known as the Commonwealth of Nations.\"  As long ago as 1884, however, Lord Rosebery, while visiting Australia, had described the changing British Empire—as some of its colonies became more independent—as a \"Commonwealth of Nations\".  Conferences of British and colonial prime ministers occurred periodically from the first one in 1887, leading to the creation of the Imperial Conferences in 1911.  \n The Commonwealth developed from the imperial conferences. A specific proposal was presented by Jan Smuts in 1917 when he coined the term \"the British Commonwealth of Nations\" and envisioned the \"future constitutional relations and readjustments in essence\" at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 by delegates from the Dominions as well as Britain.   The term first received imperial statutory recognition in the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, when the term British Commonwealth of Nations was substituted for British Empire in the wording of the oath taken by members of parliament of the Irish Free State.  \n Dominions \n In the Balfour Declaration at the 1926 Imperial Conference, Britain and its dominions agreed they were \"equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by common allegiance to the Crown, and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.\" These aspects to the relationship were formalised by the Statute of Westminster in 1931, which applied to Canada without the need for ratification, but Australia, New Zealand, and Newfoundland had to ratify the statute for it to take effect. Newfoundland never did, as on 16 February 1934, with the consent of its parliament, the government of Newfoundland voluntarily ended and governance reverted to direct control from London. Newfoundland later joined Canada as its 10th province in 1949.

The bridge's top degree also carries pedestrian as well as bicycle traffic. Interstate 95 (I-95) and U.S. Route 1/9 (US 1/9) cross the stream via the bridge. The New Jersey Turnpike (part of I-95, linking to I-80) and US 46, which lie entirely within New Jersey, end halfway across the bridge at the state border with New York. At its eastern terminus in New York City, the bridge connects with the Trans-Manhattan Expressway (part of I-95, connecting to the Cross Bronx Freeway). \n -- is a double-decked suspension bridge reaching the Hudson River, connecting the Washington Levels community in the district of Manhattan in New York City to Ft Lee, New Jacket, in the United States. The New Jersey Turnpike (component of I-95, connecting to I-80) as well as US 46, which exist totally within New Jacket, end midway throughout the bridge at the state perimeter with New York.

Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.    With a U.S. Census Bureau-estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just 305 sqmi,  New York is also the most densely populated major city in the United States.  A global power city,  New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term New York minute. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations,  New York is an important center for international diplomacy  and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.   \n Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors,   New York City consists of five boroughs, each of which is a separate county of New York State.  The five boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island – were consolidated into a single city in 1898.  The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States, and as many as 800 languages are spoken in New York,  making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world.   By 2015 estimates, the New York City metropolitan region remains by a significant margin the most populous in the United States, as defined by both the Metropolitan Statistical Area (20.2 million residents) and the Combined Statistical Area (23.7", "parametric_answer": "verrazanonarrows bridge", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

Paul Getty Museum \n TRITON was a fish-tailed sea-god, the son and herald of Poseidon who stilled the waves with his conch-shell trumpet. \n Triton was also described as the god of the Tritonis, a large salt-lake in Libya. When the Argonauts found themselves stranded in the middle of the desert he helped them find passage from the lake back to the sea. \n Trtion was depicted in Greek vase painting as fish-tailed merman, sometimes bearded, sometimes youthful. In Greek sculpture and mosaic he was often given a double-fish or dolphin tail. Mosaic art also added a pair of crab-claw \"horns\", green-tinged skin, and occasionally a pair of equine forelegs. As Poseidon's herald he had a winged brow and conch-shell trumpet. \n Triton was often multiplied into a host of sea-spirits called Tritones which were regarded as satyr -like daimones (spirits) of the sea. \n FAMILY OF TRITON \n [1] POSEIDON & AMPHITRITE (Hesiod Theogony 939, Apollodorus 1.28, Hyginus Preface) \n OFFSPRING \n [2] KALLISTE (by Libya) (Apollonius Rhodius 4.1734) \n [3] TRITEIA (Pausanias 7.22.8) \n [4] THE TRITONIDES (Philostratus Elder 2.18) \n ENCYCLOPEDIA \n TRITON (Tritôn). 1. A son of Poseidon and Amphitrite (or Celaeno), who dwelt with his father and mother in a golden palace on the bottom of the sea, or according to Homer (Il. xiii. 20) at Aegae. (Hes. Theog. 930, &c.; Apollod. i. 4. § 6.) Later writers describe this divinity of the Mediterranean as riding over the sea on horses or other sea-monsters. (Ov. Heroid. vii. .50; Cic. de Nat. Deor. i. 28; Claudian, xxviii. 378.) Sometimes also Tritons are mentioned in the plural, and as serving other marine divinities in riding over the sea. Their appearance is differently described, though they are always conceived as presenting the human figure in the upper part of their bodies, while the lower part is that of a fish. Pausanias (ix. 21. § 1) says : the Tritons have green hair on their head, very fine and hard scales, breathing organs below their ears, a human nose, a broad month, with the teeth of animals, sea-green eyes, hands rough like the surface of a shell, and instead of feet, a tail like that of dolphins. (Comp. Orph, Hymn 23. 4 ; Plin. H. N. xxxvi. 4, 7.) The chief characteristic of Tritons in poetry as well as in works of art is a trumpet consisting of a shell (concha), which the Tritons blow at the command of Poseidon, to soothe the restless waves of the sea (Ov. Met. i. 333), and in the fight of the Gigantes this trumpet served to frighten the enemies. (Hygin. Poet. Astr. ii. 23; comp. Paus. viii. 2. § 3; Mosch. ii. 20; Virg. Aen. x. 209, &c.; Ov. Met. ii. 8; Plin. H. N. ix. 5.) Tritons were sometimes represented with two horse's feet instead of arms, and they were then called Centaur-Tritons or Ichthyocentaurs. (Tzetz. ad Lyc. 34, 886, 892.) Their figures are frequently mentioned in works of art, as in the sanctuary of Poseidon on the Corinthian isthmus (Paus. ii. 1. § 7), in the temple of Dionysus at Tanagra (ix. 20. § 4; comp.

{"question": "Five docks built on The Manchester Ship Canal in what is now Salford Quays were named after which Roman goddess? The area is now served by a Metrolink stop bearing the same name.", "answers": ["pomona"], "context": "Manchester docksThe Manchester docks were a series of nine docks in Salford, Stretford and Manchester at the east end of the Manchester Ship Canal in North West England.    They formed part of the Port of Manchester from 1894 until their closure in 1982. The docks marked the upper reaches of the ship canal,  and were a destination for both coastal and ocean-bound vessels carrying cargo and a limited number of passengers, often travelling to and from Canada.  \n The Manchester docks were divided into two sections; the larger Salford docks to the west of the Trafford Road swing bridge and Pomona docks to the east. Each section consisted of four docks in total, the largest being to the west; Dock 5 at Pomona was never fully completed. Of the eight working docks only one, Dock 1 at Pomona, was within Manchester itself. During much of 1948, Manchester Docks were Britain's third busiest port owing to damage suffered by the Port of Hull during the Hull Blitz. \n During the 1970s the docks began a rapid decline, largely due to containerisation. The increasing size of freight-carrying ships meant they could no longer navigate the ship canal and this, combined with increased trading with Europe and the east, saw use of Manchester Docks decrease. In 1982 the remaining docks closed and the area became derelict.  Recognising the need to redevelop the area, Salford City Council purchased the docks in 1984 using a derelict land grant. The Salford Quays Development Plan was adopted in May 1985, proposing complete reclamation and development of the area for commercial, residential and leisure use. \n Salford docks \n The Salford docks are the western (downstream) block, made of four large docks running ENE from the canal, numbered 9,8,7 and 6, the last three off a turning basin. They have now been redeveloped into Salford Quays. \n *Dock 9 is the largest of the docks and was the site of the Manchester Liners container service to Montreal.  Today the upper reaches contain cleaned water and have been cut off from their former connection to the ship canal. This cleaned water is accessed from Dock 8 via a new canal through Pier 8, while the lower section remains open to ship canal traffic. This dock was the last to be constructed, built on the former New Barnes site of Manchester Racecourse, and opened in the early years of the 20th century. \n *Dock 8 remains largely intact, although its entrance to the ship canal has been made considerably narrower. It is now accessed through a lock beneath a pedestrian drawbridge, which is used as a buffer to separate the cleaned water of docks 7, 8 and 9 from the relatively untreated water of the ship canal. This is the only route into the redeveloped basins of docks 9 and 7. The lock and drawbridge are mechanised and controlled from the Salford Quays Operations Tower. \n *Dock 7 has been cut off from the ship canal and divided into a series of small basins, linking Piers 6 and 7 by road and pedestrian footbridges. The basins provide a habitat for wildlife and the introduced fish stock. Access is again from Dock 8, at its north eastern end. \n *Dock 6 is retained in largely its original configuration. \n The smaller basins into which the docks have been divided are all named after North American lakes, reflecting the area's strong trading links the docks had with North America. \n Upstream of Dock 6 there is a triangular depression in the canal wall on a similar alignment to the other docks: this was originally a second navigable channel under a fixed road bridge. At the end of the 19th century the channel was infilled above the bridge and the remainder retained as a wharf. Later this arm was further truncated into the vestige seen today. \n While Dock 9 was being built there were plans to construct a further dock (Dock 10) downstream of, and parallel to, Dock 9. Maps from 1921 still show the proposed dock, but it is omitted on later editions. \n Pomona docks \n Pomona docks was a set of five docks on the Manchester Ship Canal.

Smith was born in Dalmally, the son of a Headmaster, and grew up in Ardrishaig in Argyll and Bute. He attended Dunoon Grammar School(Dunoon, Cowal), lodging in the town with a landlady and going home only during the holidays, before enrolling at the University of Glasgow, where he studied History from the Autumn of 1956 to 1959, and then Law, from 1959 to 1962. He joined the Labour Party in 1956. \n John Smith’s birth place in Dalmally \n He became involved in debating with the Glasgow University Dialectic Society and the Glasgow University Union. In 1962, he won The Observer Mace debating competition, speaking with Gordon Hunter. In 1995, after his death, the competition was renamed the John Smith Memorial Mace in his honour.After graduating, Smith practised as a solicitor for a year. He was then elected to the Faculty of Advocates, and later to the British Parliament as an MP. He took silk, becoming a Queens Counsel in 1983. \n Smith first stood as a Labour parliamentary candidate at a by-election in 1961 in the East Fife constituency, and contested that seat again in the 1964 general election. At the 1970 general election he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for North Lanarkshire succeeding Peggy Herbison. Smith defied the Labour whips in 1971, joining the Labour MPs who, led by Roy Jenkins, voted in favour of entry to the European Economic Community. These included Roy Hattersley, Shirley Williams, Bill Rodgers and David Owen all of whom he was later to sit with in the Callaghan cabinet. \n In October 1974, Harold Wilson offered Smith the post of Solicitor General for Scotland. Smith turned it down, not wishing his political career to become side-lined as a law officer. He was instead made an Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Energy. In December 1975 he was made a Minister of State. \n When James Callaghan became Prime Minister, Smith became a Minister of State at the Privy Council Office, serving with Labour's Deputy leader, Michael Foot, the Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons. In this position Smith piloted the highly controversial devolution proposals for Scotland and Wales through the House of Commons. Smith's adroit handling of these proposals impressed Callaghan, and in November 1978, when Edmund Dell retired, Callaghan appointed Smith Secretary of State for Trade. In this post, Smith was the youngest member of the cabinet, and served there until the 1979 general election. \n In the early 1980s Smith was Shadow Energy Secretary.

The annual Pritzker Architecture Prize is the architectural equivalent of the Nobel Prize. Previous winners Hans Hollein, Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, Zaha Hadid and Jean Nouvel have all created architectural landmarks in Vienna: From the Gasometer to the Haas House and the WU Campus. \n Who does not recognize St. Stephan’s Cathedral as the symbol of Vienna? Since 1990 its image has been reflected across the square in the glass façade of the Hans Hollein-designed Haas Haus. Hollein became the first Austrian to win the Pritzker in 1985, the world’s most prestigious architecture prize. The prize was first awarded in 1979 by American hoteliers Jay and Cindy Pritzker, owners of the Hyatt chain. The annual award comes with a cash prize of USD 100,000 and is comparable to a Nobel Prize. Previous winners include Philipp Johnson, Richard Meier, Frank Gehry, Renzo Piano, Norman Foster, Rem Koolhaas. \n Hollein’s Haas Haus is just one of the many spectacular structures that gives Vienna a modern image, despite the ever-present baroque splendour. This pioneer of post-modernism has created commercial spaces for clients including Schullin Jewelers (1984). He also worked on the ramp at the Albertina (2003) and the renovations of the Hilton Hotel (2002). Hollein has also designed several office towers in and around Vienna, including the Mediatower (2001) on the Danube canal and the towers for construction firm PORR on the Laaer Berg (2003). \n In 1991 Swiss architectural duo Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron completed a housing estate on Pilotengasse in the Vienna suburbs. Over 200 single-family homes were constructed on stilts with earth-tone paints used on the exteriors to reinforce a direct relationship between the structures and the terrain. In 2001 Herzog and de Meuron were awarded the Pritzker Prize in recognition of their work. Iraq-born architect Zaha Hadid designed an apartment house elevated on stilts in Spittelauer Lände that straddles Otto Wagner’s historic commuter train arches. The project was completed in 2005. Her spectacular library building on the new campus of the Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration was opened in 2013. \n The most recent winner of the Pritzker Prize is the French architectural star Jean Nouvel. He was awarded the 2008 prize for his life’s work. Nouvel created a distinctive apartment complex in Vienna’s 21st district in 1998. Each building has an E-shaped floor plan and exudes Mediterranean charm. His most outstanding project, however, is one of the four former gas towers in Simmering—a distinctive example of industrial architecture in this new district that started to spring up in 2001. Rather than completely rebuilding the interior of Gasometer A, Nouvel instead elected to construct living spaces in the towers that is molded to fit the inside of the curved exterior walls. The glass roof and use of materials such as glass and steel create a sense of airiness. The Sofitel on the Danube Canal, which opened at the end of 2010, is Jean Nouvel's latest masterpiece in Vienna. The interesting multi-story building, also called Nouvel Tower, presents a different structure from every angle. \n Haas House  Japanese architect duo wins Pritzker Prize for 2010 - The ...Japanese architect duo wins Pritzker Prize for 2010 - The Hindu \n Japanese architect duo wins Pritzker Prize for 2010 \n March 31, 2010 01:30 IST \n Updated: \n November 16, 2016 16:17 IST \n Share Article \n March 31, 2010 01:30 IST \n Updated: \n November 16, 2016 16:17 IST \n more-in \n The award, regarded as Nobel equivalent, carries a grant of $1,00,000 \n The Pritzker Prize, considered the highest honour in architecture and regarded by many as equivalent to the Nobel Prize, has been awarded to the Japanese duo Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa, partners in the architecture firm SANAA. \n The two architects, who got the award for 2010, have been working together", "parametric_answer": "literature", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}
{"question": "Which edifice in London was immortalised in poetry by Wordsworth in 1802 and in a painting by Canaletto in 1746?", "answers": ["westminster bridge"], "context": "CanalettoGiovanni Antonio Canal (28 October 1697 – 19 April 1768),  better known as Canaletto, was an Italian painter of landscapes, or vedute, of Venice. He was also an important printmaker in etching. He was the son of the painter Bernardo Canal, he visited England between 1746–56 and he is famous for his urban landscapes of Venice.  He is very famous for his scenes, usually associated with \"evocative views of the city\".  The Stonemason´s  Yard, was his finest work around 1725 and was presented by Sir George Beaumont in 1823/8.  \n Canaletto, together with Giambattista Pittoni, Giovan Battista Tiepolo, Giovan Battista Piazzetta, Giuseppe Maria Crespi and Francesco Guardi forms the ultimate group of Venetian old master painters. \n Early career \n He was born in Venice as the son of the painter Bernardo Canal, hence his mononym Canaletto (\"little Canal\"), and Artemisia Barbieri.  Canaletto served his apprenticeship with his father and his brother. He began in his father's occupation, that of a theatrical scene painter. Canaletto was inspired by the Roman vedutista Giovanni Paolo Pannini, and started painting the daily life of the city and its people. \n After returning from Rome in 1719, he began painting in his topographical style. His first known signed and dated work is Architectural Capriccio (1723, Milan, in a private collection). Studying with the older Luca Carlevarijs, a moderately-talented painter of urban cityscapes,   he rapidly became his master's equal. \n In 1725, the painter Alessandro Marchesini, who was also the buyer for the Lucchese art collector Stefano Conti, had inquired about buying two more 'views of Venice', when the agent urged him to consider instead the work of \"Antonio Canale... it is like Carlevaris, but you can see the sun shining in it.\"  \n Outdoor painting \n Much of Canaletto's early artwork was painted \"from nature\", differing from the then customary practice of completing paintings in the studio. Some of his later works do revert to this custom, as suggested by the tendency for distant figures to be painted as blobs of colour – an effect produced by using a camera obscura, which blurs farther-away objects. \n However, his paintings are always notable for their accuracy: he recorded the seasonal submerging of Venice in water and ice.  \n Early and late work \n Canaletto's early works remain his most coveted and, according to many authorities, his best. One of his early pieces is The Stonemason's Yard (1729, London, the National Gallery) which depicts a humble working area of the city. \n Later Canaletto painted grand scenes of the canals of Venice and the Doge's Palace. His large-scale landscapes portrayed the city's pageantry and waning traditions, making innovative use of atmospheric effects and strong local colors. For these qualities, his works may be said to have anticipated Impressionism. \n His graphic print S.A Giustina in Prà della Vale was found in the 2012 Nazi loot discovery. \n Work in England \n Many of his pictures were sold to Englishmen on their Grand Tour, often through the agency of the merchant Joseph Smith (who was later appointed British Consul in Venice in 1744). \n It was Smith who acted as an agent for Canaletto, first in requesting paintings of Venice from the painter in the early 1720s and helping him to sell his paintings to other Englishmen.  \n In the 1740s Canaletto's market was disrupted when the War of the Austrian Succession led to a reduction in the number of British visitors to Venice.  Smith also arranged for the publication of a series of etchings of \"capricci\" (or architectural phantasies) (capriccio Italian for fancy) in his vedute ideale, but the returns were not high enough, and in 1746 Canaletto moved to London, to be closer to his market. \n He remained in England until 1755, producing views of London (including several of the new Westminster Bridge, which was completed during his stay) and of his patrons' castles and houses. His 1754 painting of Old Walton Bridge includes an image of Canaletto himself. \n He was often expected", "parametric_answer": "westminster abbey", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

But on Thursday it turns 30, having changed for ever the way the nation starts the day, Others followed, arguably with greater success, but the BBC set the template for many of the now-traditional slots that jolt us awake, from eccentric astrologers and Lycra-loving fitness freaks to TV chefs and unruly animals. \n Perhaps surprisingly, the Beeb's offering started life as the underdog: its great rival TV-am, which launched nearly a month later had more money; a swanky studio in Camden, and bigger names – Anne Diamond, Nick Owen and later Roland Rat, who helped push up ratings. \n The BBC had Frank Bough, not in the first flush even then, a bouncy Nick Ross – both in unforgivable knitwear – and Selina Scott, who appeared to be on day release from an Amish aid mission. And the studio reflected the general view that the show wasn't going to be around for long. \n Ross last week recalled his envy of colleagues at TV-am: \"They had a flashy new office in Camden, we were all stuck in a corner of Lime Grove.\" \n Despite its apparent shabbiness, the show was a massively expensive gamble. It launched at a cost of £6m a year, making it the corporation's biggest investment since BBC2 went live in 1964. \n And lack of expectation for its hopes against its richer rival on commercial television, Ross agrees, meant it slipped through corporate controls, allowing it to grow quietly and at its own pace. \n \"There was a relationship with our audience. We were not the high and mighty,\" he says. \"And the editor at the time, Ron Neil, deserves much credit for making it work.\" \n Ross admits to being a bit po-faced over the format, going as it did from hard news stories to cookery demonstrations. \"I nearly threw my toys out of the pram when I heard we were doing astrology,\" he says. \"It was only in rehearsals when it came together that I saw his [Neil's] genius.\" \n The first show was presented by Bough and former ITN news reader Scott, with radio news journalist Ross, astrologer Russell Grant and fitness expert Diana Moran, dubbed \"The Green Goddess\". \n Moran, who pioneered leotard-wearing on morning TV, remembers her first section being filmed at Waterloo station. \"I was not prepared for how mad it would get,\" she says. \"I was working at Butlins in Minehead before that.\" \n The show today is watched by some 1.5million viewers daily and has a staff of about 45. The BBC will mark its 30th anniversary with archive footage, interviews with some of the original cast and perhaps live footage from the pub where a first-day segment was filmed, which, as testament to changing times, is now a vegetarian restaurant. \n Alison Ford, who has edited the current show for more than five years, said Friday's programme will nod to the anniversary but not repeat the 25th celebration, when the original presenters appeared in their jumpers. \"The breakfast audience has not changed too much,\" she says. \"People still go to work and they are in the kitchen, but we know they are not watching for the whole show.

It is uniquely badged as Chrysler for the UK \n The Ypsilon is very stylish, but many find its looks too radical \n It is in contrast to mainstream models in offering a soft ride \n The interior is stylish, but its a shame there are some flimsy plastics \n Rear space is adequate, but taller passengers will prefer the more spacious front \n The Ypsilon's designers have done a great job of hiding the rear door handles \n The 1.3-litre turbodiesel is appealing for low running costs, but the fizzy TwinAir always entertains \n Close \n The Chrysler Ypsilon is the smallest of the new breed of Italian-built Lancias, uniquely badged as Chryslers for the UK because Fiat would rather not confuse, upset or frighten us by re-launching Lancia here having killed it off years ago. \n More specifically, the Ypsilon is an ultra-compact five-door supermini, only 3.8 metres long but quite tall so it’s surprisingly credible as a five-seater. The underbits are closely related to the Fiat 500 and Ford Ka, but it sits on the longer, 2390mm wheelbase of the new Fiat Panda. Chrysler stresses space (at least for the car’s size) and luxury, both of which the Ypsilon delivers in exchange for solid prices. \n Editor-in-chief \n The Ypsilon is a badge long familiar to continental motorists \n Our test car came in tcame in top-of-the-range Limited trim and was further enhanced by two-tone paint, 16-inch alloys, ESP, a sunroof, cruise control and rain-sensing wipers, but go for the spartan 1.2-litre, 68bhp S and you get a useful cabin package, albeit with no air-con or alloys. The mid-spec SE has both. \n And overall it’s a useful, likeable little car. Once you get used to riding fairly high, and to the (attractive) central instrument cluster, it’s a relatively soft-riding little machine with lighter steering than most and a light-to-use if slightly rubbery five-speed gearchange. It’s a quite different experience from what has become the Ford-VW norm among small cars; the body isn’t so well controlled but the car copes better and more quietly than most of its peers with suburban potholes. Noise levels are also fairly low at top-end motorway cruising speeds, which makes the Ypsilon much more than a mere city car. \n The engine in our test car was the familiar GM-sourced 1.3-litre turbodiesel currently offered in Panda, 500, Corsa and Meriva, among others. In all of these applications – Ypsilon included – it is a little light on bottom-end torque but has a surprising turn of pace to the top end provided you remember to push the long-travel accelerator far enough. A 114mph top speed with an 11.0sec 0-62mph sprint is okay for a car of this duty and character, especially when you match it with 74.3mpg combined and a CO2 output of just 99g/km. \n Other engines available under the Ypsilon’s bonnet are the 1.2-litre, 69bhp petrol, which offers less performance (0-62mph in 14.5sec, 101mph) for worse economy and emissions (57.6mpg, 115g/km), and the entertaining 875cc TwinAir unit, which manages to generate 85bhp and propel the Ypsilon to 62mph in 11.9sec and on to 109mph. The TwinAir powered Ypsilons are also currently the only ones available with an automatic gearbox. \n The TwinAir engine has retained all its idiosyncrasies from other installations. It's a thrummy powerplant with a distinctive noise and a character that encourages you to extract every last drop of performance. And, for the most part, the gearbox is willing to indulge in this type of driving with you. But whilst this seems perfectly appropriate in a something like a Fiat 500, the more luxurious billing of the Ypilson implies power should be more effortlessly available. The TwinAir is undoubtedly a fantastic engine, but it is not suited to the Ypilson. \n Inside", "parametric_answer": "fiat", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

Jenni can't compare her experience with the majority of people as I know she has independence and control in the workplace. \n \"For her to say – oh, it was fine for me – does not represent the experience of the majority of women, who don't have the same control. \n \"Women in call centres, for example, can't leave the phone and go to the bathroom or get some air any time they like.\" \n The subject of discussing the menopause in the office was initially raised by Professor Dame Sally Davies, the first female chief medical officer for England. \n She has called for guidelines to be drawn up for businesses to help break the workplace \"taboo\" surrounding what is part of women's natural ageing process. \n Research indicates around a quarter of women at some point experience menopausal symptoms that adversely affect their personal and working lives. \n These typically include hot flushes, difficulty in sleeping and memory and concentration problems – all of which can leave one feeling tired and irritable during the day, disrupting work. \n Dame Sally, 66, wants women to feel more comfortable at work – and cut the amount of sick leave they take as a result. \n She said: “The menopause is a natural part of life, but it can feel like a great taboo. It is inexcusable that women who are experiencing menopausal symptoms should feel unable to discuss how they are feeling at work. \n Dame Jenni Murray  Photo: BBC Pictures \n “I want to encourage managers to ensure working women feel as comfortable discussing menopausal symptoms as they would any other issues affecting them in the workplace.

Roy Castle makes his only Carry On appearance in the \"romantic male lead\" part usually played by Jim Dale . Angela Douglas makes her fourth and final appearance in the series. Terry Scott returned to the series after his minor role in the first film of the series, Carry On Sergeant a decade earlier. The film is, in part, a spoof of \" Kiplingesque \" movies and television series about life in the British Empire , both contemporary and from earlier, Hollywood, periods. \n Contents \n Edit \n Sir Sidney Ruff-Diamond ( Sid James ) is Queen Victoria 's Governor in the British India province of Khalabar near the Khyber Pass . The province is defended by the feared 3rd Foot and Mouth Regiment (The Devils in Skirts) , who are said to not wear anything under their kilts . When Private Widdle ( Charles Hawtrey ) is found wearing underpants after an encounter with Bungdit Din ( Bernard Bresslaw ), chief of the warlike Burpa tribe, the Khasi of Khalabar ( Kenneth Williams ) plans to use this information to incite an anti-British rebellion . He aims to dispel the \"tough\" image of the Devils in Skirts by revealing that contrary to popular belief, they do indeed wear underpants under their kilts. \n A diplomatic operation ensues on the part of the British, who fail spectacularly to prove that the incident was an aberration. The Governor's wife ( Joan Sims ), in the hope of luring the Khasi into bed with her, takes a photograph of an inspection in which many of the soldiers present are found wearing underpants , and takes it to him. With this hard evidence in hand, the Khasi would be able to muster a ferocious Afghan invasion force, storm the Khyber Pass and reclaim India from British rule; but Lady Ruff-Diamond insists that he sleep with her before she parts with the photograph. He delays on account of her unattractiveness, eventually taking her away with him to Bungdit Din's palace. \n Meanwhile, the Khasi's daughter, Princess Jelhi ( Angela Douglas ), reveals to the British Captain Keene ( Roy Castle ), with whom she has fallen in love, that the Governor's wife has eloped, and a team is dispatched to return her and the photo to British hands. Disguised as Afghan generals, the interlopers are unmasked amid a farcical orgy scene, imprisoned, and scheduled to be executed at sunset along with the Governor's wife. The Khasi's daughter aids their escape in disguise, but Lady Ruff-Diamond drops the photograph on leaving the palace. The group return to the Khyber Pass to find its guards massacred and their weapons comically mutilated, in a rare moment of (albeit tainted) poignancy. All attempts to hold off the advancing hordes fail miserably, and a hasty retreat is beaten to the Governor's Palace. \n The Governor, meanwhile, has been entertaining, in numerical order, the Khasi's fifty-one wives, each one of them wishing to \"right the wrong\" that his own wife and the Khasi himself have supposedly committed against him (though no such wrong took place). After a browbeating from his wife, Sir Sidney calls a crisis meeting regarding the invasion, in which he resolves to \"do nothing\". A black tie dinner is arranged for that evening. \n Dinner takes place during a prolonged penultimate scene, in which contrapuntal snippets of the Khasi's army demolishing the Palace exterior, and the officers and ladies ignoring the devastation as they dine.

The show is well remembered for its opening titles featuring a silhouette of a person in a rocking chair. \n It starred Julia McKenzie and Anton Rodgers as Hester and William Fields, a devoted middle-class couple with an idyllic suburban lifestyle. William works while Hester keeps home. The crux of the show (and the meaning of the title) was that she was always looking to try new hobbies or find ways to improve her life, much of which exasperated her hard-working husband. \n The family home had a granny flat attached, in which Hester's mother Nancy ( Fanny Rowe ) lived. She was divorced from Hester's father Guy (played by Ballard Berkeley ) although remarried him as the series progressed. The couple had a daughter called Emma who frequently telephoned but never appeared (Debby Cummings supplied the voice). Her husband Peter ( Philip Bird ) did appear often. They later had a son — the Fields' first grandchild — whom they named Guy, after his great-grandfather . \n Perhaps the best remembered supporting character was Sonia Barrett (played by Ann Beach ) who would frequently pop round to borrow items to replace hers due to breakage, theft or mislaying. Hester was not perturbed by this, as the two were close friends, but it used to irritate William. Sonia had the show's only catchphrase — she would always knock on the back door of the Fields' home and then say It's only Sonia! as she walked in. This would sometimes lead to applause of recognition from the studio audience, a phenomenon more regularly seen within American sitcoms. Sonia's husband John (John Arthur) appeared on occasion, as did William's secretary Miss Denham, played by Daphne Oxenford . \n In the 27th and final episode of the programme, William accepted a position with a French company. In 1989, the series re-located to France and became French Fields , although only McKenzie and Rodgers, of the main characters, starred regularly in this new series though Philip Bird appeared on several episodes and Ann Beach made an appearance in the final episode. There were three series of 19 episodes made over two years, all written by John T. Chapman and Ian Davidson . \n In its heyday it was a very successful sitcom for ratings, although (or partly because) it was also regarded as very \"safe\". \n   DVD releases \n All four series of Fresh Fields have been released on DVD, A 7-disc set (containing both the series and sequel title) is scheduled for 24 October 2011. \n DVD  BuzzJack Music Forum > ITV Sitcoms of the â€˜70sâ€™ and â ...BuzzJack Music Forum > ITV Sitcoms of the â70sâ and â80sâ \n Oct 23 2007, 03:18 PM \n ITV Sitcoms of the ï¿½70sï¿½ and ï¿½80sï¿½ \n (with Leonard Rossiter, Yootha Joyce and Richard O Sullivan) \n (TELEVISION MEMORIES 11) \n Last night I was catching up on the remainder of all the weekend newspapers, when I noticed that one of the ï¿½redtopï¿½ tabloid newspapers had mocked ï¿½Stockport Sarahï¿½ from ï¿½Girls Aloudï¿½ for having a new haircut that made her look like 1970s sitcom star Yootha Joyce. \n Now, whereas I would expect that more people would be interested in talking about all the ï¿½Alternative Comedyï¿½ from the 1980s and all the surreal comedy from the late 1960s, I think that there might be somebody who is also interested in shows such as ï¿½Man About The Houseï¿½ or ï¿½George & Mildredï¿½.

It would be constructed by Al Noor Holding Investment.[http://alnoorcity.com] \n By mid-2016, nothing has been heard about this project since the announcement in 2010 that Phase I had been delayed. Given the ongoing (as of July 2016) Yemeni Civil War it seems unlikely that the project will start in the near future. \n Prospective structure \n The length of the bridge is estimated at 29 km, with a total cost of around $20 billion USD. It has been proposed by the Dubai-based firm Middle East Development LLC headed by Tarek Bin Laden. Opening date is expected to be in the year 2020. \n To clear submarine and surface vessels, the proposed bridge would have the longest suspension span in the world measuring 5 km. The overall length of the entire bridge spanning the Red Sea, starting in Yemen, connecting to the island of Perim, and continuing on to Djibouti on the African continent, would be roughly . It would have to allow very large ships of the Suezmax size in both directions simultaneously. \n It was claimed that about 100,000 cars and 50,000 rail passengers would cross the bridge daily.  \n Expected use \n Twin cities, referred to as Al Noor City, would be built on either end of the bridge; the prospective site's developers indicate that they will run on renewable energy. On the Djibouti side, President Ismael Omar Guelleh granted 500 km2 to build Noor City, the first of the hundreds of Cities of Light which the Saudi Binladen Group envisions building. The developers state that they expect Noor City to have 2.5 million residents by 2025, and the Yemeni twin city to have 4.5 million, while they envision a new airport serving both cities at a capacity of 100 million passengers annually. A new highway connecting the cities to Dubai is proposed, though there are no plans for roads to connect sparsely populated Djibouti with the population centers of Addis Ababa in Ethiopia or Khartoum in Sudan. One of the uses that are imagined for this bridge is for easy transcontinental access to the Hajj in Mecca. \n The Economist magazine, noting that developers state that the project will make Noor City the \"financial, educational, and medical hub of Africa\", commented, \"Africans may wonder why the hub is not being built in a bit of Africa where more Africans live and which has food and water.\"  \n Timeline \n ; 2009 \n Original planned start  \n ; December 2009 \n Yemen-Djibouti bridge gets go-ahead  \n ; June 2010 \n Phase I of Yemen and Djibouti Causeway delayed  July 6, 2011 – Abel DangerJuly 6, 2011 – Abel Danger \n To whom it may concern \n July 6, 2011 \n Marcy’s Gunwalker hit, IMF hook and the revolving lesbian fund \n Abel Danger believes that Crown Agents’ Sister Kristine Marcy set up the revolving fund used by Matrix 5 lesbians in DOJ Pride to finance the ‘Gunwalker’ contract hit of ATF agent Brian Terry and sexual entrapment of former IMF banker Dominique Strauss Kahn with a cutout alien ‘hooker’. \n Check #1 \n ATF hetero cutouts, lesbian crimes \n Listen June 6 11:00 PST Field McConnell, Marcy’s brother, http://radio.rumormillnews.com/ \n “[Evidence of Matrix 5 community signature at the hooker-banker encounter] Forbes … DSK Accuser Sues NY Post, Journalists For Calling Her A Hooker Jul. 5 2011 – 2:34 pm | 4 views | 0 recommendations | 0 comments  By AGUSTINO FONTEVECCHIA Dominique Strauss-Kahn’s alleged sexual attack victim sued the New York Post and five of its journalists for libel after the NY Post’s cover on July 2 – NYpost.com tabloid newspaper reported the 32-year-old Guinean [Base for Canadian sponsored pedophile entrapment and extortion at SOS Children’s Villages] resident was a prostitute, providing male guests with “favors” in exchange for cash as she worked as a chambermaid at the Sofitel in midtown Manhattan.

These songs put the emphasis on harmonizing voices with catchy lyrics and melody. \n Top in the Nation \n The first a cappella song to ever hit No.1 on the Billboard charts was Bobby McFerrin's \"Don't Worry, Be Happy.\" While it does sound like there are background instruments in the song, McFerrin created all of those sounds by overdubbing with his voice. The song would stay on the top of the charts for two weeks. The title and main lyric chorus was taken from a quote by Indian mystic Meher Baba. \n Other Hit Songs \n The Nylons, an a cappella group from Toronto, did a cover of \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\" in 1982. While the song had many forms that had been recorded all over the world for decades, the group covered the Tokens' version. The album on which it appeared went gold and the song was a huge radio hit. A British a cappella group, the Flying Pickets, had a number-one hit on the UK Singles Chart in 1983 with its cover of Yazoo's song \"Only You.\"  Only You (Yazoo song)\"Only You\" is a song written by musician Vince Clarke. He wrote it while with Depeche Mode, but recorded it in 1982 after forming the duo Yazoo with Alison Moyet. It was released as Yazoo's first single on 15 March 1982 in the United Kingdom. Upon its UK release, the single became an instant success, hitting number two on the charts. In the US, the song was released in November 1982 and charted at number sixty-seven on Billboard Hot 100, a feat only attained by one other Yazoo single (coincidentally, that single was \"Situation,\" the original UK B-side of \"Only You\"). \"Only You\" also made the US Adult Contemporary chart at number thirty-eight. \n A remix of \"Only You\" made the UK Top 40 again in 1999, while reaching number sixteen on the US Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The music video for the new version was created using the Houdini 3D animation software package.  \n Composition  \n Clarke's melody in the song \"has a sweetly yearning quality, elegantly arranged by Clarke and producer E.C. Radcliffe in a fashion that links several different monophonic synths together to give the tune more depth and melodic substance\" according to Allmusic [].

Though it used to consist of  five time zones, the Communist government changed the country to only one in the late 1940s as part of an effort to streamline it. This has led to some practical concerns for those who live far away from Beijing and, as a result, some areas do not strictly adhere to the standard time. China is the only large country besides India that only uses one time zone. \n Purpose \n The reason that the country only has one time zone is both practical and political. The Communist party established the country's current time system shortly after it founded the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949 to streamline operations, but also to make the country appear more unified. This was a strongly political move, since the country is so large and consists of many regions and ethnic minorities, and it has historically been difficult for one power to effectively rule over all the different areas. It was particularly important to establish authority over the entire country in 1949, as it had been divided by civil war for over 20 years and had gone through a period of fragmentation before that. \n Practical Concerns \n Having only one official time does cause practical problems, especially for people in the western provinces. Beijing is about 3.5 hours ahead of the far Western provinces, meaning that in some cases, the official time is already 10 AM when the sun rises in places like Xinjiang and Tibet. Since many of the people in those provinces are ethnic minorities, they sometimes feel that the use of BST is oppressive and unnecessary. Additionally, many farming communities throughout the country just use their own times, since agricultural work has to be done when the sun is out, regardless of the official time \n Exceptions \n Hong Kong and Macau both use their own time, called Hong Kong Time (HKT) and Macau Standard Time (MST), both of which are Coordinated Universal Time, plus 8 hours (UTC+8). Neither region uses daylight savings time. Many areas in Western China, particularly Xinjiang, also work on their own unofficial time zone.

The film was directed by Bruce Beresford, with Morgan Freeman reprising his role as Hoke Colburn (whom he also portrayed in the play) and Jessica Tandy playing Miss Daisy. The story defines Daisy and her point of view through a network of relationships and emotions by focusing on her home life, synagogue, friends, family, fears, and concerns over a 25-year period. \n At the 62nd Academy Awards in 1990, Driving Miss Daisy received nine nominations, including Best Actor (Morgan Freeman), and won four awards: Best Picture, Best Actress (Jessica Tandy), Best Makeup, and Best Adapted Screenplay.  \n Plot \n In 1948, Mrs. Daisy Werthan, or Miss Daisy, (Jessica Tandy), a 65-year-old wealthy, white, Jewish, widowed, retired school teacher, lives alone in Atlanta, Georgia, except for a black housemaid named Idella (Esther Rolle). When Miss Daisy wrecks her car, her son, Boolie (Dan Aykroyd), hires Hoke Colburn (Morgan Freeman), a black chauffeur. Miss Daisy at first refuses to let anyone else drive her, but gradually gives in. \n As Miss Daisy and Hoke spend time together, she gains appreciation for his many skills. After Idella dies in 1962, rather than hire a new maid, Miss Daisy decides to care for her own house and have Hoke do the cooking and the driving. \n   \n The film explores racism against blacks, which affects Hoke at that time. The film also touches on anti-semitism in the South. After her synagogue is bombed, Miss Daisy realizes that she is also a victim of prejudice. But American society is undergoing radical changes, and Miss Daisy attends a dinner at which Dr. Martin Luther King gives a speech. She initially invites Boolie to the dinner, but he declines, and suggests that Miss Daisy invite Hoke. However, Miss Daisy only asks him to be her guest during the car ride to the event and ends up attending the dinner alone, with Hoke insulted by the manner of the invitation, listening to the speech on the car radio outside. \n Hoke arrives at the house one morning in 1971 to find Miss Daisy agitated and showing signs of dementia. Hoke calms her down. Boolie arranges for Miss Daisy to enter a retirement home. In 1980, Hoke, now 85, retires. Boolie and Hoke drive to the retirement home to visit Miss Daisy, now 97.

Wulff presided over the state from 2003 until 2010, when the German parliament voted him in as the country's president. \n His resignation is a blow to Merkel, Europe's most powerful leader, who had put forward Wulff as her choice for head of state. \n Both politicians belong to the ruling Christian Democratic party, and Merkel refused to withdraw her support over the last few weeks even as questions about Wulff's conduct grew. The persistent scandal, concerning an allegedly improper loan Wulff received from a friend's wife, has been a major distraction for Merkel as she wrestles with Europe’s debt crisis and other pressing issues. \n Merkel abruptly canceled plans to meet Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti in Rome on Friday to deal with the setback at home. \n \"Mr. Wulff has decided that he is going to step back and push the interest of the general public to the forefront,\" Merkel said in a brief appearance before journalists. \n For Merkel, Wulff's departure sets up what could be a tough fight in parliament over his successor.

At the top left hand corner of the flag, over the white band, is a blue square which contains a white five-pointed star. \n The white part of the Chile flag represents the snow covered Andes mountain range. The red band in the flag represents blood shed by the national heroes in the prolonged struggle for freedom in Chile. The white star is a symbol of honor and pride and the blue square signifies the clear blue skies of Chile. \n The first flag of Chile was adopted in 1817 after it achieved independence from Spain. The current version of the flag was adopted in 1912. \n Official Name: Republic of Chile \n Proportion: 2:3 \n Adopted on: October 18, 1817 \n Location: Located in South America bordered by Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina, \n Capital City: Santiago de Chile \n Major Cities: Los Lagos, Atacama, Coquimbo, Magallanes \n Area: 291,930.4 square miles  Flag of Chile - History of the Chilean Flag | don QuijoteFlag of Chile - History of the Chilean Flag | don Quijote \n don Quixote Museum \n Flag of Chile \n Chilean flag comprises of two horizontal stripes of red and white, with a blue square on the left-hand corner which consists of a five pointed white star. \n Read the Spanish version \n The original Chilean flag, hoisted for the first time amongst the determined fight for independence from the Spanish empire , looked nothing like today’s version, which federal law requires Chileans to wave on all homes and businesses on certain yearly holidays. Today’s national flag of Chile, adopted in 1817, does however bear a striking resemblance to a flag used by the indigenous Mapuche people of the Chilean region, as described in the epic poem La Araucana by the 16th century soldier-poet Alonso de Ercilla. \n The Chilean flag features two horizontal bands, the top one is white and the bottom one red. In the top left corner of the flag, a lone white star sits in the middle of a blue square. The flag may also be flown horizontally, in which case the blue square and white star must continue to appear in the upper left corner. \n Americans may easily mistake the flag of Chile for the Texan flag, the only difference being that the blue square of the Texan flag stretches to the bottom when displayed in horizontal position and not just to the bottom of the white band. Their similarity is probably a coincidence, as the star and stripe features and their colors are common to flags around the world including the Cuban flag and the Liberian flag. The star, along with the red, white and blue of each of these flags represent different respective elements of cultural and historical significance. In the case of Chile’s flag colors, white traditionally represents the snow of the Andes Mountains, the blue symbolizes the sky while the red recalls the blood shed by early Chileans fighting for the country’s independence from Spain. \n A number of possible influences could have inspired the inclusion of the lone star. Some say that it points out the fact that chile is a Unitarian republic. Others say it symbolizes a guide to progress and honor. Most interestingly, early descriptions of a flag used by the indigenous Mapuche troops during the Arauco War depict an all blue flag with a white star in the middle; nearly identical to the blue canton of today’s Chilean flag. The Arauco War, an armed conflict between the Spanish and the Mapuche, lasted for centuries, beginning with the early Spanish conquest in the 1500s and ending years after Chilean independence.

{"question": "Protons and Neutrons are both examples of which class of sub-atomic particle that takes its name from the Greek for 'heavy'?", "answers": ["baryons"], "context": "ProtonA proton is a subatomic particle, symbol  or , with a positive electric charge of +1e elementary charge and mass slightly less than that of a neutron. Protons and neutrons, each with masses of approximately one atomic mass unit, are collectively referred to as \"nucleons\". One or more protons are present in the nucleus of every atom. The number of protons in the nucleus is the defining property of an element, and is referred to as the atomic number (represented by the symbol Z). Since each element has a unique number of protons, each element has its own unique atomic number. The word proton is Greek for \"first\", and this name was given to the hydrogen nucleus by Ernest Rutherford in 1920. In previous years Rutherford had discovered that the hydrogen nucleus (known to be the lightest nucleus) could be extracted from the nuclei of nitrogen by collision. Protons were therefore a candidate to be a fundamental particle and a building block of nitrogen and all other heavier atomic nuclei. \n In the modern Standard Model of particle physics, protons are hadrons, and like neutrons, the other nucleon (particle present in atomic nuclei), are composed of three quarks. Although protons were originally considered fundamental or elementary particles, they are now known to be composed of three valence quarks: two up quarks and one down quark. The rest masses of quarks contribute only about 1% of a proton's mass, however.  The remainder of a proton's mass is due to quantum chromodynamics binding energy, which includes the kinetic energy of the quarks and the energy of the gluon fields that bind the quarks together. Because protons are not fundamental particles, they possess a physical size; the radius of a proton is about 0.84–0.87 fm or  to .   \n At sufficiently low temperatures, free protons will bind to electrons. However, the character of such bound protons does not change, and they remain protons. A fast proton moving through matter will slow by interactions with electrons and nuclei, until it is captured by the electron cloud of an atom. The result is a protonated atom, which is a chemical compound of hydrogen. In vacuum, when free electrons are present, a sufficiently slow proton may pick up a single free electron, becoming a neutral hydrogen atom, which is chemically a free radical. Such \"free hydrogen atoms\" tend to react chemically with many other types of atoms at sufficiently low energies. When free hydrogen atoms react with each other, they form neutral hydrogen molecules (H2), which are the most common molecular component of molecular clouds in interstellar space. Such molecules of hydrogen on Earth may then serve (among many other uses) as a convenient source of protons for accelerators (as used in proton therapy) and other hadron particle physics experiments that require protons to accelerate, with the most powerful and noted example being the Large Hadron Collider. \n Description \n Protons are spin-½ fermions and are composed of three valence quarks,  making them baryons (a sub-type of hadrons). The two up quarks and one down quark of a proton are held together by the strong force, mediated by gluons. \n A modern perspective has a proton composed of the valence quarks (up, up, down), the gluons, and transitory pairs of sea quarks. Protons have an approximately exponentially decaying positive charge distribution with a mean square radius of about 0.8 fm. \n Protons and neutrons are both nucleons, which may be bound together by the nuclear force to form atomic nuclei. The nucleus of the most common isotope of the hydrogen atom (with the chemical symbol \"H\") is a lone proton. The nuclei of the heavy hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium contain one proton bound to one and two neutrons, respectively. All other types of atomic nuclei are composed of two or more protons and various numbers of neutrons. \n History \n The concept of a hydrogen-like particle as a constituent of other atoms was developed over a long period. As early as 1815, William Prout proposed that all atoms are composed of hydrogen atoms (which he called \"protyles\"), based on a simplistic interpretation of early", "parametric_answer": "hadrons", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

He entered Parliament through the general election of 1886 as the Liberal member for East Fife.  During the parliamentary investigation of Charles Parnell in 1888 Asquith rose to national distinction as Parnell's junior defence attorney.  His abilities soon became recognised by his superiors, and in 1892 he was appointed as Home Secretary by Gladstone. \n From 1895 the country saw ten years of Conservative administrations.  During this period Asquith was out of office and returned to the Bar.  In 1905 the Liberals swept back into power with a strong majority, and Asquith was appointed as Chancellor of the Exchequer.  He soon set about introducing social reform, and succeeded in establishing pensions for most of those over 70 years of age, and enforced a higher rate of tax on unearned income.  In 1908 Asquith succeeded Henry Campbell-Bannerman as the new Prime Minister. \n Asquith started his tenure by following Gladstone's policy of attacking the power of those in the House of Lords. Historically the Lords were always obstructive of Liberal policy making.  Crises began in 1909 when the Lords rejected the government's budget.  Asquith dissolved Parliament, and there followed a bitter battle between the Liberals and Lords.  Asquith enlisted the support of the Irish members in return for the introduction of a bill preventing the lords' veto.  In April 1910 he introduced the Parliament Bill, consolidating the power of the Commons and thus reducing that of the Lords.  The bill was successfully passed in 1911. \n The Parliament Act drastically reduced the power of the Lords, and so without their veto Asquith was able to introduce his Home Rule for Ireland Bill.  Unsurprisingly, the bill sparked much controversy, and became an issue of national conflict for the next three years.  It met bitter resistance in Ireland, and led to the brink of civil war.  Pressure increased during 1913 and 14 and matters were only averted by the outbreak of World War I.  The rise of war in Europe served only to accentuate the problems at home.  Asquith avoided declaring war until the public became aroused, but after provocation from the Bosnian crisis in June 1914 Britain declared war against the Germans.  In 1915 Asquith formed a coalition government with Balfour, Bonar Law, Carson, Henderson, Lord Kitchener and Lloyd George.  Unfortunately the coalition was not successful, and because of heavy war casualties, severe financial problems and the war dragging on, the government soon became unpopular. \n Opposition to Asquith's 'calmness' in this situation grew, many feeling that he was not handling the war in a suitably effective manner.  In December 1916, the opposition faction in government forced him to resign in favour of his Minister for War, David Lloyd George.  Asquith remained in Parliament, but was out of office having refused to serve under Lloyd George.  He also declined the king's offer of the Garter, and in the election of 1918 Asquith eventually lost his seat at East Fife. \n In 1920 Asquith returned to the Commons as an 'Independent Liberal', and after the fall of Lloyd George's government in 1922, he united the Liberal Party once more.  However, after a Labour victory in 1924, Asquith gradually lost support and eventually lost his seat.  In 1925 King George offered him a peerage and Asquith took his seat in the Lords although he was 72 years of age.

Since then Phil seems to have got the message and not appeared in much else. \n Kerry Katona \n Kerry Katona’s stint in the jungle gave her ‘career’ a new lease of life (Picture: BigPictures) \n Kerry has arguably been one of the more successful contestants on I’m A Celebrity – it was just a pity she couldn’t hang on to her fame. Emerging as the first Queen of the Jungle, Katona then flogged frozen food in a series of cosy Iceland adverts, only to have the gig taken from her during her battle with drink and drugs. \n The former Atomic Kitten member then felt the need to ‘set the record straight’ and entered the Celebrity Big Brother house.

{"question": "Which country took over the Presidency of the European Union from Sweden on 1st. January 2010?", "answers": ["spain"], "context": "CIA - The World Factbook -- European UnionThe World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency \n Preliminary statement: \n The evolution of what is today the European Union (EU) from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's hybrid intergovernmental and supranational organization of 28 countries across the European continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history. Dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in Europe; on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged - the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Austro-Hungarian Empire were examples. But for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is unique. \n Although the EU is not a federation in the strict sense, it is far more than a free-trade association such as ASEAN, NAFTA, or Mercosur, and it has certain attributes associated with independent nations: its own flag, currency (for some members), and law-making abilities, as well as diplomatic representation and a common foreign and security policy in its dealings with external partners. \n Thus, inclusion of basic intelligence on the EU has been deemed appropriate as a separate entity in The World Factbook. However, because of the EU's special status, this description is placed after the regular country entries. \n Background: \n Following the two devastating World Wars in the first half of the 20th century, a number of far-sighted European leaders in the late 1940s sought a response to the overwhelming desire for peace and reconciliation on the continent. In 1950, the French Foreign Minister Robert SCHUMAN proposed pooling the production of coal and steel in Western Europe and setting up an organization for that purpose that would bring France and the Federal Republic of Germany together and would be open to other countries as well. The following year, the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was set up when six members - Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands - signed the Treaty of Paris. \n The ECSC was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other elements of the countries' economies. In 1957, envisioning an \"ever closer union,\" the Treaties of Rome created the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market. In 1967, the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the European Community (EC), creating a single Commission, a single Council of Ministers, and the body known today as the European Parliament. Members of the European Parliament were initially selected by national parliaments, but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and have been held every five years since. \n In 1973, the first enlargement of the EC took place with the addition of Denmark, Ireland, and the UK. The 1980s saw further membership expansion with Greece joining in 1981 and Spain and Portugal in 1986. The 1992 Treaty of Maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy, in judicial and internal affairs, and in the creation of an economic and monetary union - including a common currency. This further integration created the European Union (EU), at the time standing alongside the EC. In 1995, Austria, Finland, and Sweden joined the EU/EC, raising the membership total to 15. \n A new currency, the euro, was launched in world money markets on 1 January 1999; it became the unit of exchange for all EU member states except Denmark, Sweden, and the UK. In 2002, citizens of those 12 countries began using euro banknotes and coins. Ten new countries joined the EU in 2004 - Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Bulgaria and Romania joined in 2007 and Croatia in 2013, bringing the current membership to 28. (Seven of these new countries - Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Slovakia, and Slovenia - have now adopted the euro, bringing total euro-zone membership to 19.", "parametric_answer": "belgium", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

{"question": "The Battle of Asculum took place in 279 BC between the Romans and the Greeks in which the Romans lost 6,000 men, while the Greeks lost 3,500, including many of their officers. Who commanded the 'victorious' Greeks?", "answers": ["pyrrhus of epirus"], "context": "Pyrrhic War : definition of Pyrrhic War and synonyms of ...Pyrrhic War : definition of Pyrrhic War and synonyms of Pyrrhic War (English) \n The Pyrrhic War ( 280 – 275 BC ) was a complex series of battles and shifting political alliances among the Greeks (specifically Epirus , Macedonia , and the city states of Magna Graecia ), Romans , the Italian peoples (primarily the Samnites and the Etruscans ), and the Carthaginians . [1] [2] \n The Pyrrhic War initially started as a minor conflict between Rome and the city of Tarentum over a naval treaty violation by one of the Roman consuls . Tarentum had, however, lent aid to the Greek ruler Pyrrhus of Epirus in his conflict with Corcyra , and requested military aid from Epirus. Pyrrhus honored his obligation to Tarentum and joined the complex series of conflicts involving Tarentum and the Romans , Samnites , Etruscans , and Thurii (as well as other cities of Magna Graecia ). Pyrrhus also involved himself in the internal political conflicts of Sicily , as well as the Sicilian struggle against Carthaginian dominance. \n Pyrrhus' involvement in the regional conflicts of Sicily reduced the Carthaginian influence there drastically. In Italy, his involvement seems to have been mostly ineffectual but had long term implications. The Pyrrhic war proved both that the states of ancient Greece had essentially become incapable of defending the independent colonies of Magna Graecia and that the Roman legions were capable of competing with the armies of the Hellenistic kingdoms — the dominant Mediterranean powers of the time. This opened the way for Roman dominance over the city states of Magna Graecia and advanced the Roman consolidation of power in Italy greatly. Rome's proven record in international military conflicts would also aid its resolve in its rivalry with Carthage , which was eventually to culminate in the Punic Wars . \n Linguistically, the Pyrrhic War is the source of the expression \" Pyrrhic victory ,\" a term for a victory won at too high a cost. Its origin can be seen in Plutarch 's description of Pyrrhus' reaction to the report of a victorious battle: \n The two armies separated; and we are told that Pyrrhus said to one who was congratulating him on his victory, \"If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined.\" \n 12 Notes \n   Background \n   Map showing the location of the Etruscan civilization and the twelve Etruscan League cities, circa 500 BC. Etruscan influence had been reduced a great deal from this representation by the time of the Pyrrhic war. \n To the north of Roman-controlled Latium lay the Etruscan cities, and to the south of Roman-controlled Samnium lay the Greek city states of Magna Graecia : politically independent cities in southern Italia and Sicily , settled by Greek colonists in the 7th and 8th centuries BC. Both in Sicily and on the mainland, conflict between all of these groups was ongoing. The Latin War (340–338 BC) had placed the Latium region under Roman dominance, if not outright control, and the resistance of the Samnites against Roman control was coming to an end with a few minor conflicts being the only remnants of the Samnite Wars (343–290 BC). \n The patchwork of Italian and Sicilian cultures and nations had resulted in continuing conflicts and territory changes, which in recent decades had seen an expansion of Roman influence over Italy. Rome was, however, a \"local Italian concern\", never having tried its hand in the larger international affairs of the Mediterranean, nor pitted its military strength against any of the dominant Greek cultures. The Pyrrhic war would change both of these facts. \n   Tarentum asks for help \n In 282 BC , Rome was called by the city of Thurii for military assistance in a dispute it had with another city. In response, Rome sent out a fleet of ships that entered the Bay of Tarentum. This act violated a longstanding treaty between it and the city of Tarentum , which forbade Rome from entering Tarentine waters. Enraged by what it considered a hostile aggression, the city attacked the fleet, sinking several ships and sending the rest away. Rome was shocked and angered by this incident and sent out diplomats to defuse the situation. However, negotiations turned sour", "parametric_answer": "archelaus", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

Especially when that man had precise details of the murder and knew things only a murderer or someone on the inside could. \n But not if the then Conservative Home Secretary had anything to do with it. And so James Hanratty was executed – the eighth to last person to be hanged in England. \n Paralysis \n He was found guilty of the now infamous A6 murder, in which Michael Gregson was murdered, while his companion Valerie Storie was left paralysed after having been raped and then shot five times. \n The murder took place in the aptly named Deadman’s Hill just off the A6 and, despite having an alibi that placed him in Rhyl at the time of the murder, Hanratty was nevertheless branded a killer and sentenced to death. But the case wasn’t closed there. \n Suspect \n There was another man on the scene. Peter Alphon was another suspect and he was the person who’d written to the Home Secretary purporting to be the killer, and he definitely knew aspects of the case that only an insider could. Alphon confessed to having been paid off to end the couple’s alleged affair. When they failed to split, he said he blew Gregson away. \n Despite all this Hanratty was ultimately hanged in 1962 for the crime, but his family took up his battle to clear his name posthumously. They even supplied DNA samples, but those ironically only served to strengthen the case against him – apparently after those tests, there was a mere 1 in a billion chance that it was not Hanratty. But there was no guarantee that the DNA samples were not tainted. \n According to a retrospective in the Independent, there was a whole cavalcade of celebrities who lent their support to the condemned man’s cause, among them in 1969 ‘John Lennon and Yoko Ono produced a 40-minute documentary and even lent the Hanratty family their Rolls-Royce to visit the scene of the crime’. \n Also on this day  Carpenders Park Cemetery | James Hanratty - Our OxheyCarpenders Park Cemetery | James Hanratty | People | Our Oxhey \n © Copyright oddsock and licensed for reuse under this Creative Commons Licence. \n Carpenders Park Cemetery \n By Sue Green \n Background to case \n Hanratty was charged with killing Michael  Gregson and raping and wounding Valerie Stone on August  22nd 1961 in a layby on A6 near Slough.

He was a key figure in the resurrection of appreciation for the works of Bach, which had been forgotten following the time of Frederick the Great of Prussia , with whom Bach valiantly contended for the sake of Christianity . \n Not only this, however, Mendelssohn became an ardent opponent of the extravagant Wagnerian philosophy of \"Total Art,\" which, overtaking Europe for a time and eventually infecting America, required very expensive venues to house simultaneous lengthy performances of Ballet, Symphony and Opera, and was successful enough to cause such a drought in these individual genres as to threaten their existence. \n In 1830, Felix Mendelssohn penned his Fifth Symphony, in honor of the 300th anniversary of the Presentation of the Augsburg Confession. Circumstances prevented its timely completion. It was finally published in 1868, twenty-one years after his death, during the peak of Wagnerian artistic philosophy and the consequent trough of the symphonic form itself. It was entitled, the Reformation Symphony. In a manner typical of the Romantic Era, the music was composed as a tonal representation of the struggle for the Truth of the Gospel throughout the Reformation, beginning with John Wycliffe – the \"Morning Star of the Reformation\" – and Jan Huss up through the German Reformation led by Dr. Martin Luther . It isn't until the latter third of the symphony that the Lutheran can recognize the triumphant strains of Luther's Reformation hymn, A Mighty Fortress . \n More than a tonal representation of the Reformation, Mendelssohn's Reformation Symphony was singularly responsible for reviving the symphonic form throughout Europe and America, as well. With it's clearly Lutheran tonal imagery, it was instantly popular among European immigrants in America, most of whom settled in the midwest, and being a relatively short and simple composition, it was within the talent spectrum of the average German or Scandinavian immigrant, many of whom had acquired a superb education in Europe prior to their journey here, many more of whom had at least average if not advanced musical skill. In fact, many local and regional symphonies and music societies were created specifically to play this piece, and survived for many years thereafter, reviving the symphony and the musical arts not only in the midwest and America, but in Europe as well. Indeed, the popularity of Mendelssohn's Reformation Symphony in the 19th Century has been credited with felling Wagner's philosophy of \"Total Art.\" \n A fitting piece to spend a few minutes with this evening as we remember and celebrate the Reformation, this is a full recording of Mendelssohn's Symphony No. 5 in D major/D minor, Reformation Symphony, performed by the New York Philharmonic, and led by Leonard Bernstein. \n Mendelssohn's Reformation Symphony  Mendelssohn: Symphony No. 5 in D major, Op. 107 ...Mendelssohn: Symphony No. 5 in D major, Op. 107 'Reformation' on SACD - Buy online from Presto Classical \n City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra , Edward Gardner \n ‘Mendelssohn in Birmingham’ is an exciting new recording project with the CBSO and its Principal Guest Conductor, Edward Gardner.

{"question": "A democracy is a society ruled by the people. What name is given to a society ruled by the wealthy?", "answers": ["plutocracy"], "context": "America Is Ruled by Billionaires, and They Are Coming ...America Is Ruled by Billionaires, and They Are Coming After the Last Shreds of Our Democracy | Alternet \n America Is Ruled by Billionaires, and They Are Coming After the Last Shreds of Our Democracy \n America is a plutocracy through and through -- what are we going to do about it? \n Comments \n Plutocracy literally means rule by the rich. “Rule” can have various shades of meaning: those who exercise the authority of public office are wealthy; their wealth explains why they hold that office; they exercise that authority in the interests of the rich; they have the primary influence over who holds those offices and the actions they take. These aspects of “plutocracy” are not exclusive. Government of the rich and for the rich need not berun directly by the rich. Also, in some exceptional circumstances rich individuals who hold powerful positions may govern in the interests of the many, e.g. Franklin Roosevelt. \n The United States today qualifies as a plutocracy – on a number of grounds.  Let’s look at some striking bits of evidence. Gross income redistribution upwards in the hierarchy has been a feature of American society for the past decades. The familiar statistics tell us that nearly 80% of the national wealth generated since 1973 has gone to the upper 2%, 65% to the upper 1 per cent. Estimates as to the rise in real income for salaried workers over the past 40 years range from 20% to 28 %. In that period, real GDP has risen by 110% – it has more than doubled.  \n To put it somewhat differently, according to the Congressional Budget Office,  the top earning 1 percent of households gained about 8X more than those in the 60 percentile after federal taxes and income transfers over a period between 1979 and 2007; 10X those in lower percentiles.  In short, the overwhelming fraction of all the wealth created over two generations has gone to those at the very top of the income pyramid.  That pattern has been markedly accelerated since the financial crisis hit in 2008. Between 2000 and 2012, the real net worth of 90% of Americans has declined by 25%.  Theoretically, there is the possibility that this change is due to structural economic features operating nationally and internationally. That argument won’t wash, though, for three reasons. First, there is no reason to think that such a process has accelerated over the past five years during which disparities have widened at a faster rate. Second, other countries (many even more enmeshed in the world economy) have seen nothing like the drastic phenomenon occurring in the United States. Third, the readiness of the country’s political class to ignore what has been happening, and the absence of remedial action that could have been taken, in themselves are clear indicators of who shapes thinking and determines public policy. In addition, several significant governmental actions have been taken that directly favor the moneyed interests. \n The latter include the dismantling of the apparatus to regulate financial activities specifically and big business generally. Runaway exploitation of the system by predatory banks was made possible by the Clinton “reforms” of the 1990s and the lax application of those rules that still prevailed. Attorney General Eric Holder just a few weeks ago went so far as to admit that the Department of Justice’s decisions on when to bring criminal charges against the biggest financial institutions will depend not on the question of legal violations alone but would include the hypothetical effects on economic stability of their prosecution. Earlier, Holder had extended blanket immunity to Bank of America and other mortgage lenders for their apparent criminality in forging, robo-signing, foreclosure documents on millions of home owners. In brief, equal protection and application of the law has been suspended. That is plutocracy. \n Moreover, the extreme of a regulatory culture that, in effect, turns public officials into tame accessories to financial abuse emerged in stark relief at the Levin Committee hearings on J P Morgan Chase’s ‘London Whale” scandal. Morgan officials stated baldly that they chose not to inform the Controller of the Currency about discrepancies in trading accounts", "parametric_answer": "oligarchy", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

It is named after the game show Beat the Clock. \n The song peaked at #10 in August 1979 and spent six weeks in the UK Singles Chart.  It was their third and final top ten single in the UK. \n The song was taken from the album No. 1 In Heaven and produced by Giorgio Moroder for Mellow B.V. During the late 1970s he was one of the premier producers, his working relationship grew from Sparks appreciation of Donna Summer's dynamic \"I Feel Love\" which Moroder co-wrote and co-produced. \n The 12\" remix was the first of the group's extended remixes. The remix utilised the drum pattern from the songs midsection and added a new keyboard melody line during the chorus. The \"long version\" as it was dubbed was edited to three and a half minutes and released as the b-side to seven inch single. Long versions of \"The Number One Song in Heaven\" and \"Tryouts for the Human Race\" - both singles from the same album as \"Beat the Clock\" were merely the standard album versions. \n An additional B-side on 12\" versions was a commercial promoting the album No. 1 in Heaven, which featured clips of most of the tracks. The advert was narrated by Peter Cook.  12\" versions came as colored picture discs, the inner 7\" was a picture disc while the outer 5\" came in a variety of differing colors such as blue, pink, green, and yellow. \n The song was subsequently reworked for the album Plagiarism in 1998, and a live version was released as a B-side on the UK CD single \"Now that I Own the BBC\" in January 1996. \n Track listing \n ;Seven inch Virgin VS270 \n # \"Beat the Clock\" — 3:49 \n # \"Beat the Clock\" (Alternative Mix) — 3:32 \n ;12\" Virgin VS27012 \n # \"Beat the Clock\" — 3:49 \n # \"Untitled Commercial\" \n # \"Beat the Clock\" (Long Version) — 6:43 \n Chart positions \n Personnel \n * Ron Mael - keyboards, synthesiser, vocals \n * Russell Mael - vocals \n * Chris Bennett - backing vocals \n * Keith Forsey - drums \n * Jack Moran - backing vocals \n * Giorgio Moroder - synthesiser \n * Dan Wyman - synthesiser programming \n * Dennis Young - backing vocals", "parametric_answer": "partridge family", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

Under the Royal Titles Act (1953), Queen Elizabeth II, as the Queen of New Zealand, is the Head of State and is represented, in her absence, by a non-partisan Governor-General. The Queen 'reigns but does not rule'; she has no real political influence. Political power is held by the democratically-elected Parliament of New Zealand under the leadership of the Prime Minister, who is the Head of Government. \n Parliament Building \n The New Zealand Parliament \n The New Zealand parliament has only one chamber, the House of Representatives, which usually seats 120 Members of Parliament. Parliamentary general elections are held every three years under a form of proportional representation called Mixed Member Proportional. \n Government Structure \n There is no written constitution; the Constitution Act 1986 is the principal formal statement of New Zealand's constitutional structure. The Governor-General has the power to appoint and dismiss Prime Ministers and to dissolve Parliament. The Governor-General also chairs the Executive Council, which is a formal committee consisting of all ministers of the Crown. \n Members of the Executive Council are required to be Members of Parliament, and most are also in Cabinet. Cabinet is the most senior policy-making body and is led by the Prime Minister, who is also, by convention, the Parliamentary leader of the governing party or coalition. \n The current Prime Minister is John Key, leader of the National Party, who replaced Helen Clark on 19 November 2008. The Leader of the Opposition is Phil Goff, who replaced Helen Clark as leader of the Labour Party. \n The highest court in New Zealand is the Supreme Court of New Zealand. This was established in 2004 following the passage of the Supreme Court Act 2003, which also abolished the option to appeal to the Privy Council in London. The current Chief Justice is Dame Sian Elias. New Zealand's judiciary also includes the High Court, which deals with serious criminal offences and civil matters; the Court of Appeal; and subordinate courts. \n Links:  Premiers and Prime Ministers - New Zealand HistoryBiographies - Premiers and Prime Ministers | NZHistory, New Zealand history online \n Premiers and Prime Ministers \n Page 3 – Biographies \n Leaders of the nation \n Find out more about the 39 premiers and prime ministers who have held office in New Zealand since 1856.

The traditional U.S. mariner's      cable was 120 fathoms long. This is equal      to 720 feet, or 0.1185 nautical mile ,      or about 219.4 meters. The British Admiralty, in 1830, defined the cable to      equal exactly 0.1 nautical (Admiralty) mile, which is 608 feet or about 185.3      meters. Some navies are now using a metric cable equal to exactly 200 meters      (about 656.17 ft). \n cabot \n a traditional unit of volume in Jersey (Channel Islands), used for both      liquid and dry commodities in trade. The cabot equals 10 pots [3], which is 17.375 Imperial quarts or about 19.747 liters. For dry commodities, the cabot is roughly comparable      to 1/2 bushel . \n cade \n an old name for a cask, sometimes used as a unit of measure for fish. A      cade of herring, for example, was 720 fish. \n calendar year (cal yr) \n a civil unit of time, equal to 365 days or (in leap years) 366 days. See year [2]. In archaeology, climatology,      and other sciences studying the earth over the last 40 000 years or so, a      careful distinction must be made between calendar years (cal yr) and radiocarbon      years (14C yr). \n caliber (cal) [1] \n a unit used to express the bore of a gun. (The bore is the inside diameter      of the gun barrel.) Traditionally, the diameter was stated in inches, so     that      \".22 caliber\" referred to a pistol having a bore of 0.22 inches (5.588 mm).      This usage is declining, because bore diameters of many guns are now stated      directly in millimeters. \"Caliber\" is the American spelling; elsewhere the       unit is often spelled \"calibre.\" The decimal point is usually omitted when       caliber measurements are spoken (as in \"38-caliber\"). Sometimes it is     omitted when the measurement is written, but this is not a good practice. \n caliber (cal) [2] \n a measure of the relative length of a gun barrel, defined as the length      divided by the diameter of the bore. Thus a 50-caliber gun on a warship has      a barrel 50 times longer than its bore. Confining the shell within the barrel      for a longer time increases the velocity, so guns with a higher caliber usually      have a longer range. \n caliper \n the thickness of a sheet of paper or card stock. Traditionally measured      in points [7] (thousandths of an inch),      caliper is now measured in microns (micrometers). The word \"caliper\" is sometimes      used in place of the proper unit, as in \".004 caliper\" (.004 inch or 4 points)      or \"120 caliper\" (120 microns). \n call second (Cs) \n a unit of telecommunications traffic equal to one or more calls or other      communications having an aggregate duration of one second. The call      minute (Cmin) and call hour (Ch) are defined similarly. \n Callipic cycle \n a unit of time equal to 76 years or 4 Metonic      cycles , formerly used in astronomy in predicting the phases of the Moon.      After the passage of one Callipic cycle, the phases of the Moon repeat essentially      on the same calendar dates as in the preceding cycle. The cycle is named for      the Greek astronomer Callipus, who discovered it in 330 BCE. \n calorie (cal) \n the CGS unit of heat energy. This calorie (also      called a gram calorie or small calorie)      is the amount of heat required at a pressure of one atmosphere to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius. Unfortunately,      this varies with the temperature of the water, so it is necessary to specify      which degree Celsius is meant.

He lived in Kilburn, North Yorkshire, where he set up a business manufacturing oak furniture, which featured a carved mouse on almost every piece. It is claimed that the mouse motif came about accidentally in 1919 following a conversation about \"being as poor as a church mouse\", which took place between Thompson and one of his colleagues during the carving of a cornice for a screen. This chance remark led to him carving a mouse and this remained part of his work from this point onwards. \n He was part of the 1920s revival of craftsmanship, inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement led by William Morris, John Ruskin and Thomas Carlyle.

He was a stern,, puritanical gentleman who, when on deck, wore a black silk cloak made of a French material called gros grain.  This rustled as he made his way around his ship and his sailors corrupted the words gros grain and called him ~Old Grog~. At that time drunkenness and vice in the Navy life was rife, and ~Old Grog~ thought of a way he might improve the situation.  He ordered that all rum rations should henceforth be watered down, from which time it came to be called grog by the sailors. \n We can also see a buoy positioned in the River close to his old house called the Grog Buoy commemorating this little ~naming~. \n continuing on our way we could then view those ashore participating in their own ~grog ration~ at The ~Butt and Oyster~ public house  to be found in the riverside hamlet of  What is Grog?

Grog dates from the mid-18th century, when it was introduced as a way of reducing drunkenness on ships in the British Royal Navy. \n Historically, the problem of liquid on board ships during long trips has been a difficult one for sailors to deal with. Water tends to grow algae and other plant life, and beer tends to spoil on long journeys. As a result, when rum was introduced in the mid-17th century, it quickly became the drink of choice for navies throughout the world. The British Navy particularly depended on it, and after 1655, a daily ration of ½ pint of rum was given to sailors. Unfortunately, many sailors became intoxicated and unruly from drinking rum, a problem that was exacerbated by men saving up their daily rations until they had a significant quantity stored that they could drink all at once. \n Ad \n In 1756, an Admiral Vernon came up with the idea of diluting his men’s rum with water. This not only made it less alcoholic, but the water also made the rum susceptible to spoiling if sailors chose to save it. From 1756 until 1970, the British Royal Navy served a daily ration, or tot, of grog on board each ship at 11 a.m.  Admiral Vernon, the inventor of this practice of diluting the rum, was known not only as a friend to the sailors, but also for the waterproof cloak he wore, which was made from grogam wool. This cloak earned him the nickname Old Grog, and after his invention of the new ration, the nickname was transferred to his creation. \n In later years, citrus was added to the traditional Royal Navy grog in order to ward off scurvy among sailors. Since sailors on board Royal Navy vessels often had to go for many months without fresh fruits or vegetables, adding lemon or lime juice to their grog helped to keep their vitamin C intake at sufficient levels. Another take on grog, popular on board pirate vessels, was known as bumbo or bumboo. Since pirate vessels tended to stay out for shorter periods of time and they kept themselves better fed, the lime and lemon juice could be left out of their mixture. Instead, they added sugar, nutmeg, and occasionally cinnamon to help flavor the grog and make it more palatable. \n Ad \n tolleranza \n Post 10 \n I used to work in a coastal town that is known for its pirate history", "parametric_answer": "edward hawke", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}
{"question": "In which country is the Eurovision Song Contest to be held later this month?", "answers": ["serbia"], "context": "List of countries in the Eurovision Song ContestFifty-two countries have participated in the Eurovision Song Contest since it started in 1956. Of these, twenty-five have won the contest. The contest, organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), is held annually between members of the Union. Broadcasters from different countries submit songs to the event, and cast votes to determine the most popular in the competition. \n Participation in the contest is primarily open to all active member broadcasters of the EBU. To be an active member, broadcasters must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union, or be in a Council of Europe member country.  Eligibility to participate is not determined by geographic inclusion within the continent of Europe, despite the \"Euro\" in \"Eurovision\" — nor does it have a direct connection with the European Union. Several countries geographically outside the boundaries of Europe have competed: Israel, Cyprus and Armenia, in Western Asia, since 1973, 1981 and 2006 respectively; Morocco, in North Africa, in the 1980 competition alone; and Australia making a debut in the 2015 contest. In addition, several transcontinental countries with only part of their territory in Europe have competed: Turkey, since 1975; Russia, since 1994; Georgia, since 2007; and Azerbaijan, which made its first appearance in the 2008 edition. Two of the countries that have previously sought to enter the competition, Lebanon and Tunisia, in Western Asia and North Africa respectively, are also outside of Europe. The Gulf state of Qatar, in Western Asia, announced in 2009 its interest in joining the contest in time for the 2011 edition. However, this did not materialise, and there are no known plans for a future Qatari entry the Eurovision Song Contest. Australia, where the contest has been broadcast since the 1970s, debuted as a participant in the 2015 edition, with another entry in 2016. The Czech Republic, Cyprus, and Serbia returned for 2015 contest and Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia and Ukraine have announced their return in time for the 2016 contest. \n The number of countries participating each year has grown steadily, from seven in 1956 to over twenty in the late 1980s. A record 43 countries participated in 2008 and 2011. As the number of contestants has risen, preliminary competitions and relegation have been introduced, to ensure that as many countries as possible get the chance to compete. In 1993, a preliminary show, Kvalifikacija za Millstreet (\"Qualification for Millstreet\"), was held to select three Eastern European countries to compete for the first time at the main Contest.  After the 1993 Contest, a relegation rule was introduced; the six lowest-placed countries in the contest would not compete the following year.  In 1996, a new system was introduced. Audio tapes of all twenty-nine entrants were submitted to national juries. The twenty-two highest-placed songs after the juries voted reached the contest. Norway, as host country, was given a bye to the final.  From 1997 to 2001 a system was used whereby the countries with the lowest average scores over the previous five years were relegated. Countries could not be relegated for more than one year.  \n Between 2001 and 2003, the relegation system used in 1994 and 1995 was used. In 2004, a semi-final was introduced. The ten highest-placed countries in the previous year's Contest qualified for the final, along with the \"Big Four\": the largest financial contributors to the EBU. All other countries entered the semi-final. Ten countries qualified from the semi, leaving a final of twenty-four.  In 2008, two semi-finals were held with all countries, except the host country and the Big Four, participating in one of the semi-finals.  \n Some countries, such as Germany, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom, have entered on all but a handful of occasions; Morocco, on the other hand, has only entered once.

Unlike much of the English language, the names of elements tend to have been chosen by the researchers who first discovered them rather than developing organically over time. There are no rules as to how these names are decided, but the history of chemistry reveals some quite fascinating trends… \n People and places \n Many are the people who, for their contributions to science, have been honoured with an element named after them. Among the most illustrious are Nicolaus Copernicus (copernicum, Cn), first to publish the outrageous suggestion that the Sun did not revolve around the Earth; Alfred Nobel (nobelium, No), best known for inventing dynamite and founding the Nobel prizes, and Albert Einstein (Einsteinium, Es), who developed the general theory of relativity. Some names took a detour through other languages: gallium, Ga, was named after its French discoverer Lecoq, whose name translates to ‘the cockerel’ in English, ‘gallus’ in Latin. \n Another trend is for researchers to name new elements after a place. European nations and cities get the most recognition, often as the places where elements were first discovered or out of the researchers’ sense of patriotism . A few places receive recognition that seems perhaps disproportionate to their size, such as the village of Strontian in the Scottish Highlands where strontium (Sr) was mined, or Ytterby on the Swedish island of Resarӧ, which gave its name to no fewer than four elements: ytterbium (Yb), yttrium (Y), terbium (Tb), and erbium (Er). The last three are intended to reflect the decreasing strength of the metal oxides by using decreasing proportions of the original word. \n Metals and mythology \n You are probably aware that the planets in our solar system take their names from the Roman names of the classical gods. What you might not know is that each planet was further associated with a metal: gold (Au) with the Sun, iron (Fe) with Mars, mercury (Hg) with – you guessed it – Mercury, and so on. This trend was picked up by researchers in the 19th and early 20th century, so that a number of elements get their names ‘second-hand’, as it were, from Classical mythology . Cerium (Ce) was named in 1804 after the recently discovered asteroid Ceres , in turn named after the classical goddess of agriculture. Pallas , the next asteroid to be discovered, which was named after the goddess Pallas Athena, gave its name to palladium (Pd). \n Martin Heinrich Klaproth , a German chemist at the turn of the 19th century, set off quite a chain of events with the naming of element 92 (uranium, U) after the god and planet Uranus in 1790. He named titanium (Ti) after the Titans , by analogy with uranium’s naming after the god, and named tellurium (Te) after the Earth (Latin tellus) by analogy with uranium’s naming after the planet. In 1818, J. J. Berzelius chose the name selenium (Se), from the Greek selene for ‘moon’, for his newly discovered element, on the basis of its similar chemical properties to tellurium. A century and a half later, Enrico Fermi revived the trail by naming neptunium (Np), the element which comes after uranium in the periodic table, after the next planet in the solar system. Finally, in 1942, Seaborg & Wahl chose the name plutonium (Pu) for element 94, again reflecting the order of the planets (or what was then considered a planet). \n Anders Ekeburg, a Swedish chemist, decided to follow the trend but with a slightly more imaginative twist. The element he had discovered in 1802, unlike many metals, was unable to absorb acid .

The dish was one of a handful recommended to the British public by the Ministry of Food during the war to support a nutritional diet, despite shortages and rationing of many types of food - especially meat. The pie was named after  Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton , who became Minister of Food in 1940. \n Woolton Pie consisted of diced and cooked potatoes (or parsnips), cauliflower, rutabaga, carrots and turnips. Rolled oats and chopped spring onions were added to the thickened vegetable water, which was poured over the vegetables themselves. The dish was topped with potato pastry and grated cheese and served with vegetable gravy. The recipe could be adapted to reflect the availability and seasonality of ingredients. \n Lacking in any meat, Woolton Pie was not well received by the British public. In fact, it was among several wartime austerity dishes that were quickly forgotten by the end of the war.  \n Below is a recipe for Woolton Pie: \n WOOLTON PIE   Woolton Pie - World Carrot MuseumWoolton Pie \n History Wild Carrot Today Nutrition Cultivation Recipes Trivia Links Home Contact \n Lord Woolton Pie, created with  Carrots! \n The recipe for Woolton Pie was the creation of  Francis Ladry, the chef of the Savoy hotel and named after Lord Woolton, head of the Ministry  of Food.  Many people had their own interpretation of this recipe, but they almost always used carrots! Basically it is mixed vegetables, a sauce and a topping , which could be pastry or potatoes mashed or sliced.  The Official recipe as reported in \"The Times\" on 26 April 1941 is shown  below . \n Introduced in May 1941, it continued to raise a hollow laugh throughout the war.  In fact, Woolton Pie was far from being a laughing matter. Lord Woolton, Britain's wartime Minister of Food (for the early part of WW2), charmed and cajoled the public  into eating not only Woolton Pie but a 'National loaf' - pictured here baked as  a 'Victory loaf'. \n It was named after Frederick Marquis, Lord Woolton, the ex-managing director of  a store chain called Lewis (mainly in the north of England) and ex-social  worker, who was appointed Minister of Food in April 1940. Unglamorous his position may have been, but it was vital to the war effort. It  says much for Woolton's personal charm that he was remarkably popular with the  public, even when singing the praises of rissoles without beef, cakes without  sugar and tea without tea leaves. \n Much of Woolton's success was due to his business skill in budgeting specific items -- he only rationed  items of which he was certain he had enough to go around, however small the  quantities. This built up a  sense of fairness and trust with those who were struggling with their own personal budget and the  war effort itself. He also believed that  the public should be educated and helped, not just instructed. \n This he did by means of an inspired publicity campaign, introducing 'Dr Carrot' and 'Potato Pete',  by broadcasts with 'Gert and Daisy' - the music hall artistes Elsie and Doris  Walters, and by 'Kitchen Front' spots on the BBC radio, 'Food Flashes' (short  films) in the cinema and a massive advertising campaign in the press. \n Apparently neither the pie or the loaf were particularly liked, but by the end of the War, the country was fitter and  healthier than it ever had been.  \n As a whole the population, was slimmer and healthier than it  is today", "parametric_answer": "swede", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

Judi Dench plays an imperious Queen Elizabeth. \n Simon Callow plays the Master of the Revels. Martin Clunes plays the actor Richard Burbage. Imelda Staunton plays the real-world equivalent of Juliet’s nurse. Colin Firth, who graduate students in my day pined over as Mr. Darcy in the BBC Pride and Prejudice, plays the monstrously-arrogant Lord Wessex. \n Tom Wilkinson plays Hugh Fennyman. \n Geoffrey Rush, who is Australian, plays theatre-owner Philip Henslowe. \n From Hollywood, Gwyneth Paltrow plays Viola De Lesseps, and Ben Affleck plays Ned Alleyn, actor extraordinaire. \n The premise is that Shakespeare is a scattered genius who stole ideas and lines from the very atmosphere of London, and the plot of Romeo and Juliet from the love affair he was having at the time. For hardcore Shakespeareans, there is an abundance of inside jokes. \n Of course, the entire film is an inside joke—the Elizabethan period is both worshipfully recreated and occasionally undercut by a postmodern understanding of history and psychology. \n Tom Stoppard co-wrote Shakespeare in Love with Marc Norman, a mysterious television and film writer who wrote an episode of Mission Impossible in 1970, and directed three episodes of White Shadow. Marc Norman has a decade-long gap in his career from 1985 to 1995. In that mid-nineties return, he wrote the Geena Davis pirate-epic Cutthroat Island. \n Shakespeare in Love won the best picture Oscar for 1998. I like it anyway. \n What I want to know is how Stoppard and Norman collaborated on the script. The idea that Shakespeare was not some absolute literary deity was put forth in Stoppard’s 1976 play, The Fifteen Minute Hamlet ( filmed in 1995 ), and one is inclined to believe that Stoppard did most of the work. It is that witty, despite the occasional Hollywood flourish and old-fashioned mores that one might be inclined to assign to Norman. \n Then again, if the thesis of Shakespeare in Love is correct, then perhaps Norman is responsible for much of what was good in the screenplay, and dignified and ennobled Stoppard’s contributions, whatever they are. \n The occasional Hollywood moments make the film seem momentarily trite, or too contrived, but the climax of the film, and the major moments of the film, manage to be compelling work. \n And the acting is top-notch. Even the Americans perform well, including Ben Affleck. Especially Ben Affleck. \n If you have watched Romeo and Juliet lately (a good version, say Franco Zeffirelli’s, and not Baz fucking Luhrmann’s ), then Shakespeare in Love is a fine film, better than many more serious, straightforward adaptations of the bard’s work. \n The idea of Shakespeare being a horn-dog and a playwright capable of sublime affection is a dialectic that feels about right. And its thesis—that if we are imaginative enough, we can survive love—is an impressive one. \n _______ \n John King (Episode, well,  all of them ) holds a PhD in English from Purdue University, and an MFA from New York University.

Wilson \n Lancelot Gobbo’s Hunchback \n Launcelot Gobbo, a clown, servant to Shylock.  \n The Merchant of Venice, dramatis personae  \n In Italian, the word gobbo means “hunchbacked,” and some scholars have squeezed this term to suggest that the Launcelot Gobbo of The Merchant of Venice is, like Richard III and Caliban, physically deformed. It must be said that this reading receives no support from the text; Shakespeare does not thematize deformity with Gobbo as he does with Richard and Caliban, although, formally speaking, Gobbo does occupy a place in the structure of the play similar to that of Shakespeare’s stigmatized characters, not only Richard and Caliban, but also Falstaff and indeed Shylock himself. Like Shylock, who may or may not have been stigmatized with an artificial nose on the Elizabethan stage, Gobbo may or may not have been played as a hunchback: the keynote of stigma in The Merchant of Venice is uncertainty. Yet, after the question of a visible physical abnormality represented in their costumes comes up empty, it can be noted that both Shylock and Gobbo do exhibit the other elements in what I have called the  figure of stigma : villainy, irony, and tragicomedy. Gobbo’s villainy is clearly a different brand than Shylock’s. If Shylock points back to the vengeful violence of Richard, Gobbo points forward to the merry mischief of Falstaff, the latter pair being the kind of villain who recalls the etymology of that word, villain, from the Latin villa, “country house,” making a villain a low-born and base-minded social inferior like Gobbo. As for irony, both Shylock and Gobbo collude with the audience, Shylock with his tragic soliloquies, and Gobbo with his comic asides. That is, between Shylock and Gobbo, the one is a bit more tragic, the other a bit more comic, but both contain the essence of tragicomedy that is always an element of stigma in Shakespeare’s plays, as represented by the shared fate of these two characters. Each is a tragicomic remainder in a relentless romantic comedy, each being included in but alienated from the supposedly sacred societies established at the end of The Merchant of Venice - Shylock a Jewish convert in Christian Venice, Gobbo an unmarried man in the otherwise completely conjugal Belmont. Because Shylock and Gobbo mirror each other, and each is possibly but not certainly stigmatized in his body, it is tempting to think that Shakespeare did indeed have the concept of stigma in mind as he was crafting these characters, though we have no stable footing on this issue, which is exactly the point. Gobbo’s hunchback and Shkylock’s nose are both question marks. In The Merchant of Venice, as in life, the origins of stigma are beset with uncertainty, its operation with uneasiness, and its outcome with a mixture of happiness and sadness. \n Context \n Physical Deformity in Shakespeare \n Bibliography \n Gilbert, Miriam. “The Problem of Launcelot Gobbo.” Shakespeare at Stratford: The Merchant of Venice.

Perth Concert Hall, November-December 2013 \n LINN CKD450 SACD [70:59 + 62:25] \n With complete sets from Simon Rattle and from Yannick Nezet-Seguin, this is turning out to be quite the year for Schumann symphonies. However, this new set from Robin Ticciati and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra elbows those two aside and takes its place towards the very top of the list of recommendations for these works, in this year or in any other. Concerts of the complete set took pride of place in the SCO’s programme for autumn 2013: I found them very impressive then , and these CDs only serve to reinforce that impression of quality. \n   \n Robin Ticciati’s work with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra has been characterised by precise attention to detail and real care for the colour of the sound. His great achievement with the Schumann symphonies is that he peels back the Romantic patina of the years and reminds us that these are symphonies from the early half of the nineteenth century. As John Worthen’s booklet notes point out, Beethoven had been dead for only fourteen years by the time of Schumann’s first symphony, and the heavy encrusting that would befall much orchestral music was still a long way in the future. Here, therefore, we hear Schumann’s thoughts stripped of the weight that would later lie on their shoulders and would, I suspect, be the source of the accusation that Schumann was a poor orchestrator. With forces of this size and skill, that allegation simply evaporates. Not a moment sounds unbalanced or out of sync. Instead Ticciati and his musicians have found a way of presenting Schumann’s symphonic world with openness, brightness and superb clarity. \n   \n As a part of this, Ticciati is light on his feet in his interpretations. Tempi are on the fast side, and this means that the clarity of attack which characterises his readings is realised to its very fullest potential. There is great precision on display here, and the thwacks that end the Rhenish are only the most exciting example. Listen, for example, to the brilliant trumpet triplets that punctuate the scherzo sections of the Spring’s third movement or the light-as-a-feather articulation of the Fourth’s finale. \n   \n He conducts with the long view in mind and never plays things for a quick thrill. The fanfare that opens the Spring symphony, for example, seems to grow with each passing note, and the entire movement builds up to that fanfare’s majestic reappearance in the recapitulation. Then, however, Ticciati surprises you with a beautifully tender rendition of the violin line in the coda, a beautiful moment that I had never really noticed before. Similarly, the introduction to No. 2 is pregnant with anticipation, spilling into a rhythmically buoyant account of that first movement that bristles with quiet energy. He also plays delicately with the rhythm at times, such as a tiny holding back in the finale of the Spring symphony that adds bags of character. \n   \n The orchestra match him with a carefully textured sound that is both light and flexible. The strings play with minimal vibrato, thus giving them a thinner sound than in big symphony orchestra recordings, but that also makes them more flexible and prone to feats of great agility. Listen, for example, to the sprightly manner in which they tackle the main theme of the Fourth’s opening movement. They can be used to great theatrical effect too, however, such as in the solemn slow movement of the Rhenish where they sound even slightly emaciated: this evocation of the cathedral brings to mind penitence and mourning rather than mere scene-setting.

{"question": "\"What was the name of the Spencers' baby in the 1970's sitcom \"\"Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em\"\"?\"", "answers": ["jessica"], "context": "Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'EmSome Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em is a BBC television sitcom, created and written by Raymond Allen and starring Michael Crawford and Michele Dotrice. It was first broadcast in 1973 and ran for three series, ending in 1978. The series follows the accident-prone Frank Spencer and his tolerant wife, Betty, through Frank's various attempts to hold down a job, which frequently end in disaster. The sitcom was filmed in and around the town of Bedford in Bedfordshire. It was noted for its stuntwork, performed by Crawford himself, as well as featuring various well-remembered and much lampooned catchphrases, that have become part of popular culture. In a 2004 poll to find Britain's Best Sitcom, Some Mothers Do 'Ave Em came 22nd. \n Title \n The expression \"Some mothers do have them\" is meant to refer to someone clumsy or foolish. \n The character of Frank Spencer \n The wimpish, smiling Frank, sporting his trademark beret and trench coat, is married to the apparently normal Betty (Michele Dotrice) and in later series they have a baby daughter, Jessica. The character was popular with television impressionists such as Mike Yarwood in the 1970s, particularly his main catchphrase, \"Ooh Betty\", which is only ever said in one episode: series 2, episode 2. \n \"Ooh Betty ...\" is not Frank's only catchphrase of the series. Others include a quavering \"Oooh ...\", usually uttered with his forefinger to his mouth as he stands amidst the chaos of some disaster he has just caused (and which he himself has invariably escaped unscathed). He also sometimes complains about being \"ha-RASSed!\", or occasionally, \"I've had a lot of ha-RASSments lately\" (originally an American pronunciation). Other recurring catchphrases include references to \"a bit of trouble\", which usually implies some sort of undisclosed digestive disorder, and to the cat having \"done a whoopsie\" (presumably a euphemism for having urinated in an inappropriate place, on one occasion in Spencer's beret). If Frank is pleased (or confused) about something, he will often use the catchphrase \"Mmmm — nice!\" or \"Awww — nice!\" \n Despite his unfailing ability to infuriate people, Frank is essentially a very sympathetic character, who inspires much affection from his ever-loving and patient wife, Betty.  He also venerates the memory of his late mother (Jessica Spencer) and worships his daughter (also named Jessica). \n The final series was written by Allen based on stories by Michael Crawford (not written by Crawford himself as sometimes reported) and made five years after the previous one (although there had been two Christmas specials in between). Frank's character changes noticeably in this series, becoming more self-aware and keen to make himself appear more educated and well-spoken. He develops an air of pomposity which is always best demonstrated when someone would approach and enquire \"Mr Spencer?\" to which he would always reply, \"I am he.\" He also becomes more self-assured, and much more willing to argue back when criticised, and often wins arguments by leaving his opponents dumbfounded by the bizarreness of what he would say. \n Acknowledging the show's success in Australia, the final series saw him begin talk of having relations there, and contemplating emigrating. \n Crawford himself has talked of how he based many of Frank's reactions on those of a young child.  Crawford also found it difficult to break out of the public association with the role, despite his later career as a hugely successful musical performer on the West End and Broadway stage, in popular shows such as Barnum and The Phantom of the Opera. \n Casting \n Ronnie Barker and Norman Wisdom were the BBC's first and second choices for the role of Frank. However the casting of Crawford proved effective, as many of Frank's mannerisms and turns of phrase were invented by the actor, and his stunt-performing and singing skills were undoubtedly useful. \n In addition to Frank and Betty, most episodes would introduce at least one other character", "parametric_answer": "michael", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

The trust was renamed Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust in its founder's honour on 26 March 1999. Its patron is Princess Anne , the Princess Royal. [2] \n Its headquarters are at Les Augrès Manor on the isle of Jersey in the English Channel. The grounds of Les Augrès Manor form the Durrell Wildlife Park , which was originally established by Gerald Durrell in 1959 as a sanctuary and breeding centre for endangered species. The zoological park was known as the Jersey Zoo at that time. \n Gerald Durrell \n Gerald Durrell OBE , author and broadcaster on wildlife conservation, was the founder of the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust. He wrote 37 books which have been translated into 31 languages. He additionally featured in several additional television series and one-off programmes, which documented his work in Jersey and around the world. \n In 1945 he became a student keeper at the Zoological Society of London 's Whipsnade Park. At 21 he inherited £3,000 and he financed, organised and led the first of several animal collecting expeditions. It was on these expeditions that he first became aware of the desperate struggle for survival a large number of animal species were facing in the wild, and he became convinced that zoos had a responsibility to try to prevent further decline and extinctions. \n Despite strong resistance to his ideas from much of the zoological community as few people recognised the alarming rate at which animals were vanishing in their native habitats, in 1959 he succeeded in creating his own Zoo in Jersey, dedicating it to saving endangered animals from extinction. \n Gerald Durrell passed away aged 70, in January 1995. His wife Lee McGeorge Durrell succeeded him as Honorary Director of the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and maintains an intense involvement in the Trust’s work both in Jersey and overseas. \n Jersey \n Durrell provides intensive hands-on management of endangered species at its Jersey headquarters and through 50 conservation programmes in 18 countries worldwide. \n Durrell’s headquarters in Jersey is a safe-haven for endangered animals which need to be rescued from whatever is threatening their survival in their native home. Here they breed and recover in numbers while keeper-conservationists observe and study them to learn more about what they'll need to thrive in the wild again. \n The Trust’s headquarters is additionally a ‘window’ to the work of Durrell Wildlife around the world - where visitors can enjoy the opportunity to see a few of the planet’s most endangered species and learn how the Trust is working to save them. What keeper-conservationists learn about a species while it is living in Jersey can help to save its cousins struggling for survival in the wild. Some species, like gorillas and orangutans , are well known while additional species, like the Livingstone's fruit bat , the pied tamarin , the giant jumping rat, the Madagascar teal ( Bernier's teal ), the echo parakeet ( Mauritius parakeet ), the mountain chicken (actually a giant frog), and Round Island boa, are more obscure. \n Other endangered animals include the aye-aye , Alaotran gentle lemur, free-ranging black lion tamarin , pied tamarin and silvery marmoset , Andean bear , maned wolf , narrow-striped mongoose, Mauritius pink pigeon , Mauritius kestrel , Saint Lucia amazon , Bali starling , Meller's duck , Madagascar teal ( Bernier's teal ), Round Island boa, Lesser Antillean iguana and Mallorcan midwife toad . \n Overseas activities \n Durrell worked with local governments, communities and additional conservation organisations in countries across the globe to save animals and their environments. \n The Trust began working in Mauritius throughout the 1970s.

{"question": "What holiday is particularly associated with Morris Dancing?", "answers": ["whitsun", "whitsunday"], "context": "Morris danceMorris dance is a form of English folk dance usually accompanied by music. It is based on rhythmic stepping and the execution of choreographed figures by a group of dancers, usually wearing bell pads on their shins. Implements such as sticks, swords and handkerchiefs may also be wielded by the dancers. In a small number of dances for one or two people, steps are  near and across a pair of clay tobacco pipes laid one across the other on the floor. \n The earliest known and surviving English written mention of Morris dance is dated to 1448, and records the payment of seven shillings to Morris dancers by the Goldsmiths' Company in London.  Further mentions of Morris dancing occur in the late 15th century, and there are also early records such as visiting bishops' \"Visitation Articles\" mention sword dancing, guising and other dancing activities, as well as mumming plays. \n While the earliest records invariably mention \"Morys\" in a court setting, and a little later in the Lord Mayors' Processions in London, it had adopted the nature of a folk dance performed in the parishes by the mid 17th century. \n Outside England, there are around 150 Morris sides (or teams) in the United States.  \n British expatriates form a larger part of the Morris tradition in Australia, Canada, New Zealand  and Hong Kong. There are isolated groups in other countries  \n Name and origins \n The name  is first recorded in the   mid-15th century as ',  ', i.e. \"Moorish dance\".  The term entered English via Flemish mooriske danse \n Comparable terms in other languages are German Moriskentanz (also from the 15th century), French morisques, Croatian moreška, and moresco, moresca or morisca in Italy and Spain. The modern spelling  Morris-dance  first appears in the 17th century.  \n It is unclear why the dance was so named, \"unless in reference to fantastic dancing or costumes\", i.e. the deliberately \"exotic\" flavour of the performance.  The English dance thus apparently arose as part of a wider 15th-century European fashion for supposedly \"Moorish\" spectacle, which also left traces in Spanish and Italian folk dance.  The means and chronology of the transmission of this fashion is now difficult to trace; the Great London Chronicle records \"spangled Spanish dancers\" performing an energetic dance before Henry VII at Christmas of 1494, but Heron's accounts also mention \"pleying of the mourice dance\" four days earlier, and the attestation of the English term from the mid-15th century establishes that there was a \"Moorish dance\" performed in England decades prior to 1494.  \n It is suggested that the tradition of rural English dancers blackening their faces may be a reference to the Moors, miners, or a disguise worn by dancing beggars.  \n History in England \n While the earliest (15th-century) references place the Morris dance in a courtly setting, it appears that the dance became part of performances for the lower classes by the later 16th century; in 1600, the Shakespearean actor William Kempe Morris danced from London to Norwich, an event chronicled in his Nine Daies Wonder (1600). \n Almost nothing is known about the folk dances of England prior to the mid-17th century.  \n While it is possible to speculate on the transition of \"Morris dancing\" from the courtly to a rural setting, it may have acquired elements of pre-Elizabethan (medieval) folk dance, such proposals will always be based on an argument from silence as there is no direct record of what such elements would have looked like. In the Elizabethan period, there was significant cultural contact between Italy and England, and it has been suggested that much of what is now considered traditional English folk dance, and especially English country dance, is descended from Italian dances imported in the 16th century.  \n By the mid 17th century,  the working peasantry took part in Morris dances, especially at Whitsun.  The Puritan government of Oliver Cromwell, however, suppressed Whitsun Ales and other such festivities.  When the crown was restored by Charles II, the springtime festivals were restored.

According to Del, he was still in nappies at the age of four when Del received a painting from their grandmother. Del also claimed in \" Mother Nature's Son \" that Rodney was still being breast fed, until he was three and a half years old, but this was probably not true and said only to embarrass Rodney. As a child, Rodney was \"all snot and Marmite\" with a \"funny haircut\". After leaving school with GCEs in Art and Mathematics, he was expelled from Art College for smoking cannabis. After being expelled from university, Del took it upon himself to give Rodney a job as an assistant market trader (or \"Financial Advisor\") and sidekick. He briefly served as Chairman of the Tenants Association. For 20 years from 1981, Rodney had worked in that pitiful position until the year 2001 when Del was banned from being the managing Director of any business by a court. When Trotters Independent Traders was about to end, Del knew that Rodney wasn't banned from managing a firm and so after 20 years as a pitiful assistant market trader, Rodney finally stepped up as Managing Director of T.I.T.Co, which allowed Del to keep on running the company secretly. \n Rodney is the son of Joan Mavis Trotter, grandson of Ted Trotter, and great-nephew of Albert Trotter. He has a nephew named Damien. Rodney is not as streetwise as his brother. Del's comments whenever Rodney makes a mistake have become catchphrases. They include \"Plonker\", \"Dipstick\" and the definitive \"What a 42 carat plonker you really are!\". \n For some time, Rodney worked as Financial Director of T.I.T.Co (a job which included such executive tasks as loading the van). Rodney has a strong conscience and is often morally outraged by Del's business activities, such as dealing in stolen goods. Despite his ethical objections, Rodney is usually enticed into Del's money making schemes by Del's persuasive charms and the temptation of financial rewards. \n In the early episodes, Rodney was troubled by his drug sentence, and also by the fact that he had a very poor job, and lived in a very grotty flat. He was worried that he would never find independence, which he really did long for. Rodney found a supportive partner in Cassandra, who he met at a computer training course, and married her in 1989. Her father Alan employed Rodney at his company Parry Print Ltd (at least until Rodney accidentally quit that job), and, with some financial assistance from Del, he was able to buy a flat and finally move out of Nelson Mandela house. Rodney and Cassandra now have a young daughter called Joan, who Rodney named after his late mother. \n Rodney went on the run for two days after Del Boy convinced him, as a joke, that he was known as \"The Peckham Pouncer,\" when a mentally unstable, seemingly drunk woman accused him of attacking her when he had only helped her from falling over. \n Throughout the series, Rodney's assumed father was Reg Trotter, although his actual paternity was occasionally called into question, such as in the 1983 and 1987 Christmas specials \" Thicker than Water \" and \" The Frog's Legacy \" due to the unavoidable fact that he shared little resemblance to either Del or Reg in terms of appearance or personalty.

It was a cruel scene. Southampton had just scored their third goal, without any Spurs reply. A minute before, the still trim figure of the 45-year-old Hoddle had been pacing the touchline in shorts and football boots, as if he wanted to run out and rescue the match himself. Now he looked resigned. He looked fired. \n To his right, the Southampton fans sang with gleeful spite: 'You're going to get the sack.' It was payback time. One of the motifs of Hoddle's time in management is the revenge of his enemies. All managers make enemies, but with Hoddle - as opposed to, say, Alex Ferguson - his enemies appear to dislike rather than fear him, and tend to raise their game as a result. A classic example was the 2002 League Cup final, in which Spurs lost to a goal by Andy Cole. When he was England manager, Hoddle dismissed Cole as needing too many scoring opportunities. It was Cole's only chance that day. \n Against Southampton, Hoddle was up against the team he had walked out on to join Tottenham. In particular, he was up against James Beattie, a player he had tried to offload at Southampton. 'Hoddle is a great coach,' Beattie was quoted as saying, 'but I know he annoyed some of the senior players. They were irritated by the way he treated them.' Two minutes into the game, Beattie scored from a header. Two minutes before half-time he added another from a 25-yard-free kick. \n Hoddle had woken that morning to bleak headlines. One newspaper suggested his career was 'on the edge of oblivion'. Others were less circumspect. He started the season as the bookies' favourite to be first manager of the new campaign to be sacked. Coming on the back of the previous home game, in which Spurs had lost 0-3 to Fulham, even Hoddle, not a man given to self-doubt, could see the writing on the wall. \n And how it had changed from his first stint at Tottenham as a player. Back in the Eighties, when Hoddle was the most gifted ball player in England, a graffiti campaign proclaimed: 'Hoddle is God.' Hyperbole is nothing new in the world of sport but, all the same, that was some billing. Over a decade earlier, the same words had been sprayed on the wall about Eric Clapton. The guitarist later became an alcoholic and a heroin addict and withdrew for some time from public performing. \n In contrast, the quiet young man from Essex took in his leggy stride the notion that he was the creator of not just exceptional goals, but also the whole universe. Indeed, if anything, he seemed to thrive on the worship of his followers (one Hoddle zealot took to wearing Nazarene robes emblazoned with the diminutive: 'Hod'). \n When asked by the Spurs sports psychologist John Syer what he felt like on a big match day, Hoddle replied: 'Lord of the Manor.' Syer told him to write the phrase down and put it in his wallet, which is precisely what the player did. \n So here was not a man who struggled with the mantle of messiah. If anything, he felt he was not appreciated enough: not only did he possess an unearthly gift for controlling a football, and then striking it with either foot, he also had a message for the masses. And the message was: this world does not understand me. \n More precisely, English football did not understand him.

It is bounded to the west by the River Dee, forming a boundary with Wales, to the east by the River Mersey, and to the north by the Irish Sea. \n The roughly rectangular peninsula is about 15 mi long and 7 mi wide. Historically, the Wirral was wholly within Cheshire; in the Domesday Book, its border with the rest of the county was placed at \"two arrow falls from Chester city walls.\" However, since the passing of the Local Government Act 1972, only the southern third has been in Cheshire, with the rest a metropolitan borough in the new county of Merseyside.  \n The Wirral contains both affluent and deprived areas, the former largely in the west and south of the peninsula, and the latter concentrated in the northeast, around the built-up district of Birkenhead. \n Origin of the name  \n The name Wirral literally means \"myrtle corner\", from the Old English wir, a myrtle tree, and heal, an angle, corner or slope. It is supposed that the land was once overgrown with bog myrtle, a plant no longer found in the area, but plentiful around Formby, to which the Wirral would once have had a similar habitat.  The name was given to the Hundred of Wirral (or Wilaveston) around the 8th century.  \n Whether the name should be preceded by the definite article is the subject of debate, as is whether something should be described as being \"in the Wirral\" or \"on the Wirral.\" In 2014, an online poll of Liverpool Echo readers indicated that 73% of respondents would use the phrase \"on the Wirral\" in everyday conversation, as opposed to \"in the Wirral\" or \"in Wirral\".  \n History  \n Prehistoric settlement  \n The earliest evidence of human occupation of the Wirral dates from the Mesolithic period, around 7000 BC. Excavations at Greasby have uncovered flint tools, signs of stake holes and a hearth used by a hunter-gatherer community, and other evidence from about the same period has been found at Irby, Hoylake and New Brighton. Later Neolithic stone axes and pottery have been found in Oxton, Neston, and Meols. At Meols and New Brighton there is evidence of continuing occupation through to the Bronze Age, around 1000 BC, and funerary urns of the period have been found at West Kirby and Hilbre.  \n Before the time of the Romans, the Wirral was inhabited by a Celtic tribe, the Cornovii. Artefacts discovered in Meols suggest it was an important port from at least 500 BC. Traders came from Gaul and the Mediterranean seeking minerals from North Wales and Cheshire.  There are also remains of a small Iron Age fort at Burton, from which the town takes its name (burh tún being Old English for \"fort town\"). \n The Romans and Britons  \n Around 70 AD, the Romans occupied Chester. Evidence of their occupation in the Wirral has been found, including the remains of a road near Mollington, Ledsham and Willaston. This road may have continued to the port at Meols, which may have been used as a base for attacking the north Wales coast. Storeton Quarry may also have been used by Romans for sculpture, and remains of possible Roman roads have also been found at Greasby and at Bidston. By the end of the Roman period, pirates were a menace to traders in the Irish Sea, and soldiers may have been garrisoned at Meols to combat this threat. \n Although Roman rule ended with the departure of the last Roman troops in 410, later coins and other material found at Meols show that it continued to operate as a trading port. There is evidence of Celtic Christianity from the 5th or 6th centuries in the originally circular shape of churchyards at Bromborough, Woodchurch and elsewhere, and also in the dedication of the parish church at Wallasey to a 4th-century bishop, Hilary of Poitiers. The Celtic names of Liscard and Landican (from llan-T/Decwyn) both suggest an ancient British origin.

{"question": "Which town was the birthplace of David Garrick?", "answers": ["hereford"], "context": "David Garrick - TheatreHistory.comDavid Garrick \n DAVID GARRICK \n This article was originally published in Encyclopedia Britannica, Eleventh Edition, Volume XI. Robert Caruthers & Adolphus William Ward. Cambridge: University Press, 1910. p. 475-77. \n GARRICK, DAVID (1717-1779), English actor and theatrical manager, was descended from a good French Protestant family named Garric or Garrique of Bordeaux, which had settled in England on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. His father, Captain Peter Garrick, who had married Arabella Clough, the daughter of a vicar choral of Lichfield cathedral, was on a recruiting expedition when his famous third son was born at Hereford on the 19th of February 1717. Captain Garrick, who had made his home at Lichfield, where he had a large family, in 1731 rejoined his regiment at Gibraltar. This kept him absent from home for many years, during which letters were written to him by \"little Davy,\" acquainting him with the doings at Lichfield. When the boy was about eleven years old he paid a short visit to Lisbon where his uncle David had settled as a wine merchant. On his father's return from Gibraltar, David, who had previously been educated at the grammar school of Lichfield, was, largely by the advice of Gilbert Walmley, registrar of the exxlesiastical court, sent with his brother George to the \"academy\" at Edial, just opened in June or July 1736 by Samuel Johnson, the senior by seven years of David, who was then nineteen. This seminary was, however, closed in about six months, and on the 2nd of March 1736/7 both Johnson and Garrick left Lichfield for London -- Johnson, as he afterwards said, \"with twopence halfpenny in his pocket,\" and Garrick \"with three-halfpence in his.\" Johnson, whose chief asset was the MS. tragedy of Irene, was at first the host of his former pupil, who, however, before the end of the year took up his residence at Rochester with John Colson (afterwards Lucasian professor at Cambridge). Captain Garrick died about a month after David's arrival in London. Soon afterwards, his uncle, the wine merchant in Lisbon, having left David a sum of £1000, he and his brother entered into partnership as wine merchants in London and Lichfield, David taking up the London business. The concern was not prosperous--though Samuel Foote's assertion that he had known Garrick with three quarts of vinegar in the cellar calling himself a wine merchant need not be taken literally--and before the end of 1741 he had spent nearly half of his capital. \n His passion for the stage completely engrossed him; he tried his hand both at dramatic criticism and at dramatic authorship. His first dramatic piece, Lethe, or Aesop in the Shades, which he was thirty-seven years later to read from a splendidly bound transcript to King George III and Queen Charlotte, was played at Drury Lane on the 15th of April 1740; and he became a well-known frequenter of theatrical circles. His first appearance on the stage was made in March 1741, incognito, as Harlequin at Goodman's Fields, Yates, who was ill, having allowed him to take his place during a few scenes of the pantomime entitled Harlequin Student, or The Fall of Pantomime with the Restoration of the Drama. Garrick subsequently accompanied a party of players from the same theatre to Ipswich, where he played his first part as an actor under the name of Lyddal, in the character of Aboan (in Southerne's Oroonoko). His success in this and other parts determined his future career. On the 19th of October 1741, he made his appearance at Goodman's Fields as Richard III and gained the most enthusiastic applause. Among the audience was Macklin, whose performance of Shylock, early in the same year, had pointed the way along which Garrick was so rapidly to pass in triumph. On the morrow the latter wrote to his brother at Lichfield, proposing to make arrangements for his withdrawel from the partnership, which, after much distressful complaint on the part of his family, met by him with the utmost consideration, were ultimately carried", "parametric_answer": "lichfield", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

The phonetic alphabet is a system created by the NATO allies in the 1950s that would be intelligible and pronounceable to all NATO allies in the heat of battle. It has another name - the radiotelephony spelling alphabet. It requires words to be spelled out by their letters; for example, arm becomes Alpha Romeo Mike, and south becomes Sierra Oscar Uniform Tango Hotel. All the letters sound different, so there is no confusion over long distances over what people are saying. The reason that any phonetic alphabet is (or was) used is because telephone , radio and walkie-talkie communications had the habit of crackling over long distances, blotting out whole words or even sentences. The normal alphabet cannot be used, because some letters, for example P, B, C and D sound similar, and over long distances were indistinguishable, so a new method had to be found. When the code was invented it was also considered that consonants are the most difficult to hear against a noisy background. Hence the sequence of vowels in the phonetic code played an important role when the code was invented, so that when you hear a noisy '-oo-oo' you know the letter is a Z. The vowel-sequence thing works for most (though not all) combinations of letters. All of the words are recognisable by native English speakers because English must be used upon request for communication between an aircraft and a control tower whenever two nations are involved, regardless of their native languages. But it is only required internationally, not domestically, thus if both parties to a radio conversation are from the same country, then another phonetic alphabet of that nation's choice may be used. \n The NATO Phonetic Alphabet is not the only phonetic alphabet in use, but it definitely is the one used by the most people and countries. From humble beginnings as only being for the NATO allies, it has spread, becoming used in a huge variety of everyday situations. It is used widely in telecommunications and business, as well as being used for call signs for hikers going through areas of bush or forest; and being the internationally recognised way of communicating at sea and by air, using the NATO phonetic alphabet means you can get what you are saying through wherever you are in the world. It is therefore a very helpful way of communicating information. \n Previous Versions \n Before the acceptance of the NATO phonetic alphabet, the British already had their own version. It was as follows: \n A - Abel \n I - In (or Indigo) \n R - Roger (or Robert) \n After the war, because many of the pilots and engineers had been taken from commercial flights, the phonetic alphabet became commonly used in civilian communications. But as many sounds were unique to English, different countries started making their own. For example, an alternative 'Ana Brazil' alphabet was used in Latin America. But the International Air Transport Association (IATA), recognising the need for a single universal alphabet, presented a draft alphabet to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) in 1947. It had sounds common to English, French, and Spanish, and after further study and modification by each approving body, the revised alphabet was implemented November 1, 1951, and is as follows: \n A - Alfa \n I - India \n R - Romeo \n Immediately, problems were found with this version. Some users felt that the list was so hard to follow that they reverted to the old 'able baker' alphabet. To identify the deficiencies of the new alphabet, testing was conducted among speakers from 31 nations, mainly by the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States.

The scheduled time was originally chosen for the first royal Christmas speech broadcast over the radio by King George V, Queen Elizabeth II's grandfather, in 1932. \n Full Answer \n Queen Elizabeth II carried on the royal family's tradition with her first speech, broadcast by radio in 1952. Her first televised speech was broadcast from the royals' winter home, Sandringham House in Norfolk, in 1957. Queen Elizabeth has since continued the tradition, delivering her personal Christmas message each year with the exception of 1969, when she wrote her message in place of a personal appearance.

The Queen was said to be keen to embrace the new technology and agreed immediately. \n After a rehearsal run-through on Christmas Day itself, the Queen went straight into the broadcast, using a teleprompter and occasionally glancing at a set of notes she kept on her desk.  Dimmock would later call her delivery of the speech “extremely accomplished”. \n The Queen made reference to the innovation, saying: “I very much hope this new medium will make my message more personal and direct. It’s inevitable that I should seem a rather remote figure to many of you … but now, at least for a few minutes, I welcome you to the peace of my own home.” \n On the 25th anniversary of the first Christmas broadcast by a monarch – made by George V in 1932 – Her Majesty continued with the theme of embracing change, while continuing to adhere to the best aspects of older ways and values. \n Do you remember the Queen’s first televised Christmas speech? Do you still watch the broadcasts? Let us know in the Comments section below. \n Christmas broadcast - Did you know? \n • The Royal broadcast had begun in 1932 at the suggestion of the BBC’s Sir John Reith as a way of inaugurating the corporation’s new Empire Service, which later became the World Service. \n • The 1932 speech delivered by George V was written by author and poet Rudyard Kipling. \n • Though now a deeply-held annual tradition, no Christmas broadcast was made in either 1936 or 1938.  It was the effect of the speeches made during World War II that convinced George VI that they should become a fixed annual event. \n • Up to and including 1959, the broadcasts were made live and recorded then repeated over the following days for the benefit of those in parts of the world unable to get a good reception on the day. \n • Since 1960, the Queen’s speech has been pre-recorded so that the tapes can be sent around the world to 17 Commonwealth countries, to be broadcast at a convenient local time. \n • In only one year, 1969, has there been no broadcast of the Queen’s speech, as that year the BBC were repeating their documentary ‘Royal Family’.

The                town lies at a narrowing of the River Orinoco. The the name was                a contraction of the town's full descriptive name 'Santo Tomé de Guayana de Angostura del Orinoco' (Saint Thomas of Guyana of                the narrows of the Orinoco). \n 2.                Angostura bitters, used in cocktails today, gets its name from                the Angostura tree which grew at the town. Angostura bitters is                derived from angostura bark from Cusparia febrifuga, a tree in the                family N. O. Rutaceae. The bark has been used for many years by                the natives of South America and West Indies as a stimulant tonic.                In large doses it causes diarrhoea and is often used as a purgative                to flush out the system. The natives also use it to stupefy fish;                in Peru, the substance Cinchona is used in a similar way. In medicine,                some doctors preferred Angostura Bark to Cinchona for use in treating                fevers. Angustura is an ingredient of bitter liqueurs and the name                of the bitter, aromatic spirit used in cocktails.

{"question": "What word connects bermuda with a Scottish Racecourse?", "answers": ["hamilton"], "context": "BermudaBermuda is a British Overseas Territory in the North Atlantic Ocean, off the east shore of North America about 1070 km east-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, 1236 km south of Cape Sable Island, Canada, and 1578 km north of Puerto Rico. The capital city is Hamilton. \n The first known European explorer to reach Bermuda was Spanish sea captain Juan de Bermúdez in 1503, after whom the islands are named. He claimed the apparently uninhabited islands for the Spanish Empire. Bermúdez never landed on the islands, but made two visits to the archipelago, of which he created a recognisable map. Shipwrecked Portuguese mariners are now thought to have been responsible for the 1543 inscription in Portuguese Rock (previously called Spanish Rock).  Subsequent Spanish or other European parties are believed to have released pigs there, which had become feral and abundant on the island by the time European settlement began. In 1609, the English Virginia Company, which had established Jamestown in Virginia (a term originally applied to all of the North American continent) two years earlier, permanently settled Bermuda in the aftermath of a hurricane, when the crew and passengers of the Sea Venture steered the ship onto the surrounding reef to prevent its sinking, then landed ashore. \n The island was administered as an extension of Virginia by the Company until 1614. Its spin-off, the Somers Isles Company, took over in 1615 and managed the colony until 1684. At that time, the company's charter was revoked, and the English Crown took over administration. The islands became a British colony following the 1707 unification of the parliaments of Scotland and England, which created the Kingdom of Great Britain. After 1949, when Newfoundland became part of Canada, Bermuda was automatically ranked as the oldest remaining British Overseas Territory. Since the transfer of Hong Kong to China in 1997, it is the most populous Territory. Its first capital, St. George's, was established in 1612 and is the oldest continuously inhabited English town in the New World. \n Bermuda's economy is based on offshore insurance and reinsurance, and tourism, the two largest economic sectors.  Bermuda had one of the world's highest GDP per capita for most of the 20th century  and several years beyond. Recently, its economic status has been affected by the global recession. It has a subtropical climate. Bermuda is the northernmost point of the Bermuda Triangle, a region of sea in which, according to legend, a number of aircraft and surface vessels have disappeared under supposedly unexplained or mysterious circumstances. The island is in the hurricane belt and prone to severe weather.  However, it is somewhat protected from the full force of a hurricane by the coral reef that surrounds the island.  \n Geography \n Bermuda is a group of low-forming volcanoes in the Atlantic Ocean, near the western edge of the Sargasso Sea, roughly 578 nautical miles (1070 km) east-southeast of Cape Hatteras  on the Outer Banks of North Carolina and about 594 nautical miles (1100 km) southeast of Martha's Vineyard of Massachusetts. It is 898 nautical miles (1664 km) northeast of Miami, Florida, and 667 nautical miles (1236 km) from Cape Sable Island, in Nova Scotia, Canada. The islands lie due east of Fripp Island, South Carolina, west of Portugal and north of Puerto Rico.  \n The archipelago is formed by high points on the rim of the caldera of a submarine volcano that forms a seamount. The volcano is one part of a range that was formed as part of the same process that formed the floor of the Atlantic, and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The top of the seamount has gone through periods of complete submergence, during which its limestone cap was formed by marine organisms, and in the Ice Ages the entire caldera was above sea level, forming an island of approximately two hundred square miles. \n It has 103 km of coastline. The two incorporated municipalities in Bermuda are the City of Hamilton and the Town of St George.

During this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including the epistolary novel which she tried then abandoned, and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth.[B] From 1811 until 1816, with the release of Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814) and Emma (1816), she achieved success as a published writer.

We know that but I don't think it helps by taking it out on the rest of the population.\" \n While gun owners and lobbyists welcomed the prince's remarks, others reacted with outrage. \n Alison Crozier, whose 5-year-old daughter Emma was among those killed at Dunblane, described the prince's remarks as \"outrageous\" and \"very insensitive.\" \n \"This is just the view of a very uninformed old man, an aristocrat. I think it has damaged the credibility of Prince Philip enormously,\" said George Robertson, a Dunblane resident and the Labor Party's Scottish secretary. \n The Sun of London editorialized yesterday that Prince Philip \"has shot himself in the foot.

But he did so with a simile that struck people as insensitive to the traumatic event in British life that gave rise to the legislation, the massacre last March of 16 schoolchildren and their teacher in the Scottish town of Dunblane by a man armed with four handguns. \n Asked where the Duke stood in a debate that the interviewer noted had become ''a very sensitive issue in the aftermath of Dunblane,'' the Prince said, ''I sympathize desperately with the people who are bereaved at Dunblane.''

[1] The positions of Bignor Villa and the four posting stations (the northern two supposed) are shown. The modern courses of the three major rivers crossed by the road are also displayed. \n Stane Street is the modern name given to an important 90-kilometre-long (56 mi) Roman road in England that linked London to the Roman town of Noviomagus Reginorum , or Regnentium, later renamed Chichester by the Saxons . [2] [3] The exact date of construction is uncertain; however on the basis of archaeological artefacts discovered along the road, it was in use by 70 AD [4] and may have been constructed in the first decade of the Roman occupation of Britain (as early as 43-53 AD). [1] \n Stane Street shows clearly the engineering principles that the Romans used when building roads. A straight line alignment from London Bridge to Chichester would have required steep crossings of the North Downs , Greensand Ridge and South Downs and so the road was designed to exploit a natural gap in the North Downs cut by the River Mole and to pass to the east of the high ground of Leith Hill before following flatter land in the River Arun valley to Pulborough . The direct survey line was followed only for the northernmost 12.5 km (8 mi) from London to Ewell . [1] At no point does the road lie more than six miles from the direct line from London Bridge to Chichester. \n Today the Roman road is easily traceable on modern maps. Much of the route is followed by the A3 , A24 , A29 and A285, although most of the course through the modern county of Surrey has either been completely abandoned or is followed only by bridlepaths . [5] Earthworks associated with the road are visible in many places where the course is not overlain by modern roads and the well-preserved section from Mickleham Downs to Thirty Acres Barn, Ashtead is listed as a scheduled monument . [5] \n Contents \n 12 Further reading \n Etymology \n Stane is simply an old spelling of “stone” ( Old Norse : steinn) which was commonly used to differentiate paved Roman roads from muddy native trackways. The name of the road is first recorded as Stanstret in both the 1270 Feet of Fines and the 1279 Assizes Rolls of Ockley . [1] It is also referred to by the modern spelling as Stone Street as far back as medieval sources. There is no surviving record of the road’s original Roman name. \n Dating evidence \n A number of first-century pottery fragments and coins have been found along the road, including Samian ware of Claudian date at Pulborough. The earliest coins found are of Claudius (41–54 AD), with others of Nero, Vespasian, Titus, Domitian and Nerva (96-98 AD). This is consistent with the road being in use by 60 to 70 AD, possibly earlier. [1] \n Surveying and construction \n Map of Stane Street showing the four main limbs (red and blue) and linking sections (black). \n The direct line from London Bridge to Chichester passes over the North Downs at Ranmore (200 m above Ordnance Datum ), the Greensand Ridge at Holmbury St Mary (260 m OD) and over the South Downs near Goodwood Racecourse (167 m OD). The steep gradients which would have been required if the road had followed a direct line would not have been practical for wheeled traffic and so the Roman engineers designed the road to cross the North Downs by natural breach cut by the River Mole and to pass to the east of the high ground of Leith Hill . The geology of the region was also considered and the road leaves the direct line at Ewell to move onto the well-drained chalk of the North Downs, in preference to remaining on the London Clay .

A soil test can determine existing nutrient levels in the soil. If one or more nutrients is low, a specific instead of an all-purpose fertilizer may be required. Fertilizers that are high in N, nitrogen, will promote green leafy growth. Excess nitrogen in the soil can cause excessive vegetative growth on plants at the expense of flower bud development. It is best to avoid fertilizing late in the growing season. Applications made at that time can force lush, vegetative growth that will not have a chance", "parametric_answer": "orchid", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

The floodlights in Buffalo Park are excellent and the ground mainly hosts limited over matches.  It is the smallest cricket ground in South Africa but has one of the best facilities.  Home to the Border Bears, it first tasted international cricket in December 1992 when India defeated South Africa in the seventh and final one-day international of their series. Since that time it has been regularly used for ODIs.  There have been some special moments in limited overs games that Buffalo Park has hosted. In December 1994, Pakistani paceman Waqar Younis claimed a hat-trick against New Zealand.  The ground hosted its first Test in October 2002 when South Africa thrashed Bangladesh by an innings and 107 runs as Graeme Smith hit 200 and Gary Kirsten 150.  During the 2003 Cricket World Cup Buffalo Park hosted a Super Sixes contest, as well as the match between South Africa and Canada.  The Buffalo Park is also known as Mercedes-Benz Park, courtesy of sponsorship from the German motor manufacturer. While it is traditionally nicknamed \"The Buffs\", it is humorously called \"The Carpark\" by the new sponsor. \n Ground Statistics  South Africa's cricket groundsSouth Africa's cricket grounds \n Tweet on Twitter \n When South Africa hosted the 2003 Cricket World Cup, South Africa, the country’s beautiful and varied cricket grounds were on show, with each of them bringing their own character to the game. \n The Wanderers exhibited the super-charged atmosphere of the “Bullring”.

Take a look around the country: \n OUTsurance Oval, Bloemfontein \n Website \n Located in Bloemfontein, the capital of the Free State province, OUTsurance Oval is a spectator-friendly ground, with the sizeable grass embankment on the eastern side especially popular with spectators. \n It is part of a wonderful sporting complex, covering a massive city block that includes facilities of either international of provincial standard for athletics, rugby, hockey, cricket, tennis and swimming. \n The ground has been used for limited-overs internationals since the fifth one-day international between South Africa and India in December 1992. The pitch is recognised as a good one-day wicket and is usually conducive to high scoring. \n OUTsurance Oval hosted its first Test in October 1999 when South Africa took on Zimbabwe. It was a good start for the Proteas as they thrashed SA’s northern neighbours by an innings and 13 runs. \n Willowmoore Park, Benoni \n Website \n One of South Africa’s newer international grounds, Willowmoore Park is a smaller-sized venue and home of the Easterns provincial team. It is also used by the Nashua Titans franchise. \n Willowmoore Park first hosted a one-day international in February 1997 when India met Zimbabwe and Sachin Tendulker celebrated the new venue’s debut with a century as the Indians won by six wickets, with over 10 overs to spare. \n Willowmoore Park remains a one-day international venue; it has not yet hosted a test.

Newhirst, Associate Sol., Washington, D.C. \n Before FRIEDMAN, SMITH and NIES, Circuit Judges. \n NIES, Circuit Judge. \n 1 \n The decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (board) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) (217 USPQ 93 (1982)), refusing registration of appellant's mark REPECHAGE for various skin care products 1 because of the likelihood of confusion with the mark SECOND CHANCE registered for face creams and other toiletries, 2 is reversed. \n 2 \n The board held that \"repechage\" is the \"French equivalent\" of the English words \"second chance\" and, thus, the marks would evoke the same commercial impression to purchasers familiar with the French language. We conclude that the board erred in holding that the record established the equivalency of the expressions. Thus, no prima facie case was made for denial of registration under 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1052(d). 3 \n Discussion \n 3 \n The goods of appellant and those identified in the registrations for the mark SECOND CHANCE are in part identical and otherwise closely related cosmetic products which would be likely to come from a single source. The issue of likelihood of confusion, therefore, turns on the similarity of the marks. \n 4 \n To support the finding of equivalency of SECOND CHANCE and REPECHAGE, the examiner had relied on the following French-English dictionary definition: \n 5 \n The New Cassell's French Dictionary: repechage, Rescuing. \n 6 \n Epreuve de repechage, supplementary heat (to give a second chance to the second bests of preliminary heats); second chance (for candidate who has failed an examination). \n 7 \n Appellant relies on the above and on the following authorities as showing that \"repechage\" and \"second chance\" are not equivalent French-English terms: \n 8 \n Harrap's New Standard French and English Dictionary, J.E. Mansion, 1977: repechage, (a) fishing up (again), fishing out (again); picking up (of torpedo, etc.); Min. [Mining]: fishing up (broken drill, etc.); (b) helping, lending a hand to, rescuing (s.o. in difficulties); Sch. [School]: supplementary, second chance, examination (for candidates who have failed); epreuve de r., (i) second chance; (ii) Sp. [Sport]: repechage. \n 9 \n Heath's Standard French and English Dictionary, J.E. Mansion, Part I: repechage, (a) Fishing up (again), fishing out (again); picking up (of torpedo, etc.). (b) Lending a hand (to s.o. in difficulties); rescuing. Sch. [School] F: Supplementary examination (esp. that held in October for candidates who failed in July at the baccalaureat examination). Epreuve de r., second chance (offered to those who have failed in a test of any kind.) \n 10 \n None of these definitions makes \"second chance\" the exact translation of \"repechage.\" The above authorities indicate that \"epreuvre de repechage\" has that meaning, but not \"repechage\" itself. In special circumstances, \"repechage\" appears to have the connotation of a reprieve or, loosely, a second chance. In the academic world, \"repechage\" means a make-up or second chance examination; in mining, the retrieval of equipment; in marine salvage, fishing things out of the water. Each of these meanings in a broad sense connotes giving a second chance, but this is not the same as saying that \"repechage\" is equivalent to \"second chance.", "parametric_answer": "doover", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

In fact, many county towns are no longer part of \"their\" administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire.

There have been many famous chemists throughout history who have made discoveries and breakthroughs that have changed the world. Here are just a few of them: \n Amedeo Avogadro (1776 - 1856) \n Amedeo Avogadro was an Italian scientist who came up with Avogadro's law which states that equal volumes of all gases contain the same number of molecules when under the same conditions of pressure and temperature. The Avogadro constant was named after him. \n Jons Jacob Berzelius (1779 - 1848) \n Jons Jacob Berzelius was a Swedish chemist who is most famous for helping to develop the notation for writing chemical formulas. He also played a role in discovering and isolating many elements including silicon , thorium, cerium, and selenium. Many chemical terms are credited to Berzelius such as \"allotrope\" and \"catalysis.\" He is called the father of Swedish chemistry. \n Robert Boyle (1627 - 1691) \n Robert Boyle is often considered the first modern chemist and one of the founders of chemical science. He also pioneered the scientific method. He developed Boyle's Law which states that, under a closed system with constant pressure, the pressure and volume of a gas are inversely proportional. \n Marie Curie (1867-1934) \n Marie Cure was a Polish chemist who coined the term radioactivity. She also discovered the elements polonium and radium. She was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize and won the award twice, once for physics in 1903 and again for chemistry in 1911. The unit for measuring radioactivity, the Curie, is named after her and her husband Pierre. Go here to learn more about Marie Curie . \n John Dalton (1766 - 1844) \n John Dalton was an English chemist who helped to develop the atomic theory about atoms and elements. In 1803 he presented the first list of atomic weights for a number of substances. Dalton is also known for his work researching color blindness. \n Sir Humphry Davy (1778 - 1829) \n Sir Humphry Davy is best known for using electrolysis to isolate and discover many elements. He is credited with isolating or discovering sodium , calcium, boron, barium, magnesium, iodine, chlorine, and potassium. He also invented a safety lamp for miners called the Davy lamp. \n Rosalind Franklin (1920 - 1958) \n Rosalind Franklin was an English chemist and physicist who contributed to the discovery of the DNA double helix. Her X-ray diffraction image of DNA played an important role in its discovery. She also performed important research into the polio and TMV viruses. \n Antoine Lavoisier (1743 - 1794) \n Antoine Lavoisier was a French chemist who is sometimes referred to as the \"father of modern chemistry\". He developed the \"law of conservation of mass\" which states that for any closed system, the mass of the system must remain constant over time. He also proved that sulfur was an element and named the elements oxygen and hydrogen . \n Dmitri Mendeleyev (1834 - 1907) \n Dmitri Mendeleyev was a Russian chemist who came up with the first periodic table of the elements which he published in 1865. He was able to predict the discovery of many more elements using the table. \n Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896) \n Alfred Nobel was a Swedish chemist and inventor who invented dynamite. He was a prolific inventor and held 350 patents. He is perhaps most famous for starting the Nobel Prize. The element nobelium is named after Alfred Noble. \n Activities \n Take a ten question quiz about this page. \n More Chemistry Subjects  ChemistryChemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter.

Camus was the second youngest-ever recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature (after Rudyard Kipling) when he received the award in 1957. He is also the shortest-lived of any literature laureate to date, having died in a car crash 3 years after receiving the award. \n These people bookmarked this quote:  Who is Albert Camus?

An author and philosopher , he was the second youngest winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature , receiving the award in 1957. His writings and philosophies brought to the world the idea of Absurdism.  His idea of the absurd was the human search for meaning and clarity within a world that offers no explanation of either. \n In his early years, Albert Camus studied at the University of Algiers, but he contracted tuberculosis, which forced him to continue his studies part-time.  In 1934, he joined the French Communist party, but soon found himself in trouble and was denounced as a Trotskyite.  He married Simone Hie, a morphine addict, in the same year.  The marriage soon broke down due to infidelities on both sides. \n Throughout his life, Albert Camus was always a political activist.  He spent his whole life strongly objecting to capital punishment. During the war, he joined the French Resistance group Combat and wrote for an underground paper of the same name.  In 1943, Albert Camus became the paper’s editor, and when the allies liberated Paris, Camus was to report on the last of the fighting.  It was during his time at the paper that he became acquainted with the existentialist writer Jean-Paul Sartre . \n In 1947, Albert Camus toured America lecturing on French existentialism .  His strong views against communism alienated him from the Communist party and eventually from Sartre.  His book The Rebel, published in 1951, was an analysis of revolution and rebellion which clarified his stance against communism. \n In 1940, Albert Camus married Francine Faure, a mathematician and pianist.  Camus argued passionately against the institution of marriage, claiming it to be unnatural.  Although he loved Francine and had twins with her, he continued to tell friends that he was not cut out for marriage.  Camus had many affairs, including a very public one with the Spanish actress Maria Casares. \n Although he rejected the title of \"existentialist writer,\" Albert Camus also disliked the title of \"philosopher of the absurd\" with which he was tagged.  Camus’ writings reflect on the experience of the absurd, rather than trying to define the philosophy.  In 1942, he published L’Etranger (The Stranger/Outsider), his most well known story of a man living an absurd life. \n Camus’ philosophies of the absurd deal with the ideas of dualism; life and death, happiness and sadness, dark and light, and so on.  He brings to the reader's attention that happiness is short and death is inevitable.  His goal is not to be morbid, but to stress that people should enjoy happiness while it lasts.  In Le Mythe, dualism is a paradox.  We can live with the dualism of happiness and unhappiness, but we cannot live with the paradox of thinking that our lives are at the same time very important and also very meaningless. \n Albert Camus died in a car accident three years after receiving the Nobel Prize for literature.

He was also Queen Victoria’s close friend and chief political adviser during the early years of her reign (from June 20, 1837). Although a Whig and an advocate of political rights for Roman Catholics, he was essentially conservative . Not believing that the world could be bettered through politics, he was always more interested in literature and theology. \n Melbourne, detail of an oil painting by J. Partridge, 1844; in the National Portrait Gallery, London \n Courtesy of the National Portrait Gallery, London \n Lamb’s mother, Elizabeth (née Milbanke), was a confidante of the poet Lord Byron and an aunt of Byron’s future wife Anne Isabella (“Annabella”) Milbanke. It was widely believed that the 1st Viscount Melbourne was not Lamb’s real father. In June 1805 Lamb married Lady Caroline Ponsonby, the eccentric daughter of Frederic Ponsonby, 3rd earl of Bessborough. The marriage had failed even before Lady Caroline’s affair with Byron in 1812–13, and, after several estrangements and reconciliations, it ended in separation in 1825, three years before her death. Subsequently, Lamb was named as corespondent in two unsuccessful divorce suits, the second, in 1836, involving the poet Caroline Norton . \n Victoria (queen of United Kingdom): Accession to the throne \n Called to the bar in 1804, Lamb entered the House of Commons in 1806. From 1822 he was an avowed supporter of the conservatism of George Canning . From April 1827 to May 1828, in the governments of Canning and Arthur Wellesley, 1st duke of Wellington, he served as chief secretary for Ireland. In 1829 he succeeded to the viscountcy. As home secretary in the 2nd Earl Grey’s ministry (Nov. 16, 1830–July 8, 1834), he reluctantly supported the parliamentary Reform Act of 1832 but forcibly repressed agrarian and industrial radicals, notably the Tolpuddle Martyrs in 1834. Consistent with this, he opposed, while prime minister, the reduction of duties on imported grain. \n Melbourne’s brief first administration ended with his dismissal by King William IV , who was offended by Whig plans for church reform. But Sir Robert Peel’s Conservatives failed to win a parliamentary majority, and Melbourne took office as prime minister once more. After Victoria’s accession he also became her private secretary for a time. Their mutual affection led to Victoria’s Whig partisanship. On May 7, 1839, during the crisis over the “bedchamber question” (the queen insisted her attendants be Whig ladies), Melbourne resigned but soon resumed office when Peel could not form a government. \n Britannica Stories  Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and ...Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland | Wikiality | Fandom powered by Wikia \n Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland \n 12,431pages on \n Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland \n has bad teeth and a funny accent because it is British . \n Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland \n has too many red links, unless you want it \n to die a miserable death, you better edit it. \n This Article Doesn't Contain Enough Truthiness \n This article needs to be more elaborate and truthy . \n Please edit out any facts. \n The Prime Minister of", "parametric_answer": "robert peel", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

The saint wears the blue garter of the English Order of the Garter , reflecting the award of this decoration in 1504 to Raphael's patron Guidobaldo da Montefeltro , Duke of Urbino , by King Henry VII of England . The first word of the order's motto, \"HONI\" can be made out. The painting was presumably commissioned by the Duke, either to present to the English emissary who brought the regalia to Urbino, Sir Gilbert Talbot , or to Henry himself - recent scholarship suggests the latter. The honour paid to a minor Italian ruler reflected Henry's appreciation of the cultural prestige of Renaissance Italy as much as any diplomatic purpose. \n The traditional subject, Saint George and the Dragon , combining chivalry and Christianity, is appropriate for the occasion; like his father, Guidobaldo was a condottiero , or proprietor of a band of mercenary soldiers. In the early stages of his career Raphael painted a number of tiny cabinet paintings, including another St George in the Louvre , and the Vision of a Knight in the National Gallery in London. \n   Provenance \n By 1627 the painting belonged to William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke (1580-1630), and was at Wilton House in Wiltshire . Either the 3rd or 4th earl presented it to King Charles I of England . After the English Civil War it was sold in one of the sales of the Royal Collection at Somerset House in London on 19 December 1651. Soon after it was in France. The painting was later a highlight of the Pierre Crozat collection which was acquired through Diderot 's mediation by Catherine II of Russia in 1772. For a century and a half, the panel hung in the Imperial Hermitage Museum . It was one of the most popular paintings in the entire collection of the Tsars. In March 1931 it was part of the Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings , and bought by Andrew Mellon , as part of his founding donation to the National Gallery of Art . The national gallery of art was a large museum. \n   References  Raphael Sanzio - Robin UrtonRaphael Sanzio \n Raphael Sanzio \n 1483-1521 \n Raphael was a painter of the                                  Italian \"High Renaissance\", considered one of the greatest and                                  most popular artists of all time. Unlike Leonardo and Michelangelo, Raphael                                  was to live a very short life, dying at the youthful age of 38. He was                                  born Raffaello Santi or Raffaello Sanzio in Urbino on April 6, 1483, and                                  received his early training in art from his father, Giovanni Santi. In                                  1499 he went to Perugia, in Umbria, and became a student and assistant                                  of the painter Perugino. Raphael imitated his master closely, and their                                  painting styles are so similar that art historians have found it difficult                                  to determine which were painted by Raphael, and which were by his master.                                  This was the beginning of his career as an absorber of influences. It                                  is said of Raphael that whatever he saw, he took possession of, always                                  growing by what was taught to him. \n   \n St. George and the Dragon,                              1505 \n St. George and The Dragon,                              1504-6 \n Both of these images of St.                              George Fighting the Dragon were painted when the artist was in his                              early twenties.

It encompasses one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United Kingdom and comprises ten metropolitan boroughs: Bolton, Bury, Oldham, Rochdale, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford, Wigan, and the cities of Manchester and Salford. Greater Manchester was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972; and designated a City Region on 1 April 2011. \n Greater Manchester spans 493 sqmi,  which roughly covers the territory of the Greater Manchester Built-up Area, the second most populous urban area in the UK. It is landlocked and borders Cheshire (to the south-west and south), Derbyshire (to the south-east), West Yorkshire (to the north-east), Lancashire (to the north) and Merseyside (to the west). There is a mix of high-density urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in Greater Manchester, but land use is mostly urban — the product of concentric urbanisation and industrialisation which occurred mostly during the 19th century when the region flourished as the global centre of the cotton industry. It has a focused central business district, formed by Manchester city centre and the adjoining parts of Salford and Trafford, but Greater Manchester is also a polycentric county with ten metropolitan districts, each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs. \n For the 12 years following 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government; district councils shared power with the Greater Manchester County Council. The county council was abolished in 1986, and so its districts (the metropolitan boroughs) effectively became unitary authority areas. However, the metropolitan county has continued to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference,•• and as a ceremonial county, has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff. Being within the Lancashire county palatine they are appointed by the monarch in their capacity as Duke of Lancaster.[http://www.duchyoflancaster.co.uk/2015/05/05/high-sheriffs-installed-across-the-county-palatine/ High Sheriffs Installed Across The County Palatine - Duchy of Lancaster] Several county-wide services were co-ordinated through the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities until April 2011, when the Greater Manchester Combined Authority was established as the strategic county-wide authority for Greater Manchester, taking on functions and responsibilities for economic development, regeneration and transport. A further devolution of powers to Greater Manchester is set to take place upon the election of the inaugural Mayor of Greater Manchester scheduled for 2017. \n Before the creation of the metropolitan county, the name SELNEC was used for the area, taken from the initials of \"South East Lancashire North East Cheshire\". Greater Manchester is an amalgamation of 70 former local government districts from the former administrative counties of Lancashire, Cheshire, the West Riding of Yorkshire and eight independent county boroughs.  Since deindustrialisation in the mid-20th century, Greater Manchester has emerged as an exporter of media and digital content, guitar and dance music, and association football. \n History \n Origins \n Although the modern county of Greater Manchester was not created until 1974, the history of its constituent settlements and parts goes back centuries. There is evidence of Iron Age habitation, particularly at Mellor, and Celtic activity in a settlement named Chochion, believed to have been an area of Wigan settled by the Brigantes.  Stretford was also part of the land believed to have been occupied by the Celtic Brigantes tribe, and lay on their border with the Cornovii on the southern side of the River Mersey. The remains of 1st-century forts at Castlefield in Manchester,  and Castleshaw Roman fort in Saddleworth,  are evidence of Roman occupation. The area was settled by Anglo-Saxons, who named it \"Mameham\". Much of the region was omitted from the Domesday Book of 1086; Redhead states that this was because only a partial survey was taken, rather than sparsity of population. \n During the Middle Ages, much of what became Greater Manchester lay within the hundred of Salfordshire – an ancient division of the county of Lancashire.

A close reading of the texts created and distributed in Little Lord Fauntleroy: A Drama in Three Acts (1889) illuminates how Burnett perceived cooperative reading communities as essential to political engagement regardless of American or English citizenship. These reading communities, made up of characters typically considered outside of the traditional family—specifically, orphans, adoptees, widows, and bachelors—model familial-reading practices and create a political family through which the characters can attain more sociopolitical leverage than would otherwise be possible. \n In the mid-1880s, Frances Hodgson Burnett’s Little Lord Fauntleroy introduced one of the most iconic characters of the late nineteenth century and initiated a cultural frenzy that detractors would nickname the “Fauntleroy plague.” Cedric, the title character, is a boy in girl’s clothing, a transplanted American Brit, a precocious child, and a middle-class mama’s boy who is the adopted heir of an earl. After its serialization in the American children’s magazine St. Nicholas between November 1885 and October 1886, Little Lord Fauntleroy went on to become a best-selling novel in volume form, an immensely popular play in both England and the US, and the inspiration for a fashion craze that would keep boys in velvet suits for years. \n So far, modern criticism has not moved much beyond Cedric’s gender identity. While this discussion is a necessary one, by focusing on Cedric’s gender we miss the opportunity to explore Burnett’s portrayal of familial reading practices as a means of creating political communities through which members can perform citizenship. Critics of Fauntleroy have illuminated Cedric’s crossing of binary categories; they have not, however, attended to how the creation, interpretation, and distribution of texts affects community building. In this case, the community that develops is formed of characters typically viewed as outside the family—specifically, orphans, widows, adoptees, and the unmarried. Lorinda B. Cohoon briefly mentions the power of reading, writing, and speaking in her discussion of conversational and benevolent citizenship in Fauntleroy, and my close reading of Little Lord Fauntleroy: A Drama in Three Acts expands on this point in order to demonstrate how it challenges traditional conceptions of citizenship and family in late nineteenth-century America and England, a discussion of particular importance considering modern-day political discourse about citizenship and belonging. \n Burnett made some notable changes to her narrative for the stage, but the general outline of the story remains true to the original serialization: a [End Page 339] young boy, Cedric, lives in New York with his widowed mother, whom he calls “Dearest.” His father, Captain Errol, was the youngest son of the Earl of Dorincourt, but the Earl disowned the Captain when he married an American woman of no social standing. Cedric knows nothing about his lineage until Mr. Havisham, the Earl’s lawyer, comes to New York to inform Mrs. Errol that the Earl’s two eldest sons have unexpectedly died, leaving Cedric heir to the title and estates. Mr. Havisham takes Cedric to England to be adopted by his selfish grandfather, and the young boy gradually changes the Earl into the benevolent landlord Cedric believes him to be. However, Cedric’s claim to the earldom comes into question when a woman named Minna arrives with her son and a marriage certificate proving that she is the widow of the Earl’s eldest son. Two of Cedric’s American friends, the grocer Mr. Hobbs and the bootblack Dick, come to England to help. Once there, Dick reveals that Minna is a bigamist and that her child is not the Earl’s grandchild, but rather Dick’s own nephew.

Robinson was the founder and front man of the Motown vocal group the Miracles, for which he also served as the group's chief songwriter and producer. Robinson led the group from its 1955 origins as the Five Chimes until 1972 when he announced a retirement from the group to focus on his role as Motown's vice president. \n However, Robinson returned to the music industry as a solo artist the following year, later scoring Top 10 solo hits such as \"Cruisin'\" (1979), \"Being With You\" (1981) and \"Just to See Her\" (1987). Following the sale of Motown Records in 1988, Robinson left the company in 1990. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. In 2016 Robinson will be awarded the Gershwin Prize for his lifetime contributions to popular music.  \n Early life and early career \n Smokey Robinson was born to an African-American father and a mother of African-American and distant French ancestry into a poor family in the North End area of Detroit. He was raised by his elder sister and her husband, after his mother died of a brain hemorrhage.  His uncle Claude gave him the nickname \"Smokey Joe\" when he was a child.   He attended Northern High School, where he was above average academically and a keen athlete, though his main interest was music and he formed a doo-wop group named the Five Chimes. At one point, he and Diana Ross lived several houses from each other on Belmont; he once said he has known Ross since she was about eight.  \n Robinson said his interest in music started after hearing the groups Nolan Strong & the Diablos and Billy Ward and his Dominoes on the radio as a child. Robinson later listed Barrett Strong, a Detroit native, as a strong vocal influence. In 1955, he formed the first lineup of the Five Chimes with childhood friend Ronald White and classmate Pete Moore. Two years later, in 1957, they were renamed the Matadors and included Bobby Rogers. Another member, Emerson Rogers, was replaced by Bobby's cousin Claudette Rogers. The group's guitarist, Marv Tarplin, joined them sometime in 1958. The Matadors began touring Detroit venues around this time. They later changed their name to the Miracles. \n Career \n The Miracles and Motown \n In August 1957, Robinson and the Miracles met songwriter Berry Gordy after a failed audition for Brunswick Records. At that time during the audition, Robinson had brought along with him a \"Big 10\" notebook with 100 songs he wrote while in high school. Gordy was impressed with Robinson's vocals and even more impressed with Robinson's ambitious songwriting.   With his help, the Miracles released their first single, \"Got a Job\", an answer song to the Silhouettes' hit single \"Get a Job\" on End Records.

At the time of his birth, he was third in the line of succession to succeed his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, but is currently fifth in line after his father, his older brother Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and William's children, George and Charlotte. \n After an education at schools in the United Kingdom and spending parts of his gap year in Australia and Lesotho, Harry chose a military career, undergoing officer training at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He was commissioned as a Cornet into the Blues and Royals of the Household Cavalry Regiment, serving temporarily with his brother, and completed his training as a troop leader. In 2007–2008, he served for 77 days in Helmand, Afghanistan,  but was pulled out following publication of his presence there by an Australian magazine.  He returned to Afghanistan for a 20-week deployment in 2012–2013 with the Army Air Corps.  He left the army in June 2015. \n Early life \n Harry was born at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London, on 15 September 1984 at 4.20 pm.  He weighed 6 lb. He was baptised on 21 December 1984 at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie. His godparents are Prince Andrew (his paternal uncle), Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones (his paternal cousin once removed), Carolyn Bartholomew (née Pride), Bryan Organ, Gerald Ward (former officer in the Household Cavalry) and Celia, Lady Vestey (née Knight).   \n Diana wanted Harry and William to have a broader range of experiences than previous royal children and took them to venues that ranged from Disney World and McDonald's to AIDS clinics and shelters for the homeless.  Harry began to accompany his parents on official visits at an early age; his first overseas royal tour was with his parents to Italy in 1985.  \n Harry's parents divorced in 1996, and his mother died following a car accident in Paris the following year. Harry and William were staying with their father at Balmoral at the time, and the Prince of Wales told his sons about their mother's death.  At his mother's funeral, Harry, then 12, accompanied his father, brother, paternal grandfather, and maternal uncle, Earl Spencer, in walking behind the funeral cortège from Kensington Palace to Westminster Abbey.  \n Education \n Like his father and brother, Harry was educated at independent schools. He started at Jane Mynors' nursery school and the pre-preparatory Wetherby School, both in London.  Following this, he attended Ludgrove School, and, after passing the entrance exams, was admitted to Eton College. The decision to place Harry at Eton went against the Windsor family convention of sending children to Gordonstoun (Harry's grandfather, father, two uncles, and two cousins all attended); it did, however, see Harry follow in the Spencer family footsteps, as both Diana's father and brother attended Eton. \n In June 2003, Harry completed his education at Eton with two A-Levels,  (achieving a grade B in art and D in geography) having decided to drop history of art after AS level.  He excelled in sports, particularly polo and rugby union.  Passing two A-levels, Harry was eligible to apply for an officer commission in the British Army.  One of Harry's former teachers, Sarah Forsyth, has assessed that Harry was a \"weak student\" and that staff at Eton conspired to help Harry cheat on examinations.  Both Eton and Harry denied the claims. While a tribunal made no ruling on the cheating claim, it \"accepted the prince had received help in preparing his A-level 'expressive' project, which he needed to pass to secure his place at Sandhurst\".     \n After school, Harry took a gap year, during which he spent time in Australia, working (as his father had done in", "parametric_answer": "princess anne", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

In  this instance the outer points of the star are level with the top of the  second red stripe (as with the earlier two), whilst the lower two points  are level with the top of the fifth red stripe, and to achieve it requires  the diameter to be 18/25 (or 72%) the canton. \n I personally like the look of the third alternative as being the  neatest, but what was intended by the legislators seems to be something  of a mystery? \n Christopher Southworth, 24 March 2005 \n The eleven stripes stand for the eleven signatories of the Liberian declaration of independence. \n Roy Stilling, 04 December 1996 \n The Liberia’s national flag is called “Lone Star”. The eleven horizontal stripes represent the  eleven signers of the declaration of independence and the constitution of the Republic of Liberia; the blue field symbolizes the continent of Africa; the five pointed white star depicts Liberia as the first “independent republic” on the continent of Africa; the red color designates “valor”; the white, “purity”;  and the blue, “fidelity”.

Each have four strings arranged in order of pitch, can be played by means of a bow (arco) or plucked (pizzicato), but whereas the violin and viola are played with the instrument resting between the shoulder and the chin, the larger cello (or, to give it its full title, violoncello) is placed facing outwards between and slightly behind the knees, and the bulky double bass is played standing up or seated on a high stool. \n Enthusiasts of Medieval, Renaissance and early Baroque music will encounter earlier varieties of bowed instruments known variously as vielle, viol, or in its earliest form, fidel (hence the modern nickname for a violin, 'fiddle'). The most popular member of the viol family is the cello's precursor, the viola da gamba (literally 'viol of the legs'). \n Woodwind \n The four principle woodwind instruments of the orchestra all work by means of a system of keys (usually silver-plated) which when variously depressed and released allow air to pass through differing lengths of the instrument resulting in notes of different pitch. In order of descending overall pitch, these are: \n Flute \n a normally silver-plated (or in more extravagant cases, gold), narrow-bored instrument, held horizontally just under the mouth, and activated by blowing air across an aperture at one end of the instrument. Its higher-pitched cousin, the piccolo, is often encountered, although the lower alto flute rather less so. Early forebears include the unkeyed fife. The most popular close relation is the recorder family, largely unkeyed and end-blown in the vertical position. \n Oboe \n a narrow-bored wooden instrument descended from the medieval shawm, held vertically, and activated by means of placing the end-positioned double-reed in the mouth, and blowing under high-pressure so as to force air between the two bound reeds, causing them to vibrate. Other members of the oboe family include the lower pitched cor anglais (or English Horn), and (far more rarely) baritone oboe and heckelphone (bass oboe). The instrument's most famous predecessor is the Baroque oboe d'amore, often used by Johann Sebastian Bach . \n Clarinet \n like the oboe usually wooden, played vertically and held in the mouth, but with a wider bore and consisting of a single reed which when activated vibrates against a detachable mouthpiece. The standard instrument can be pitched in B flat (usually) or A, and the family is unusually extensive including the higher-pitched E flat, the B flat bass, the rarely-used C, the alto (a modern relative of the basset horn), and the even more obscure double-bass or 'pedal' clarinet. Occasionally the clarinet's 'popular' cousin can be seen in the concert hall, the saxophone. \n Bassoon \n as the name would suggest, the bass member of the woodwind family, and by far the largest, especially its lower-pitched relation, the extremely bulky double or contra-bassoon. Like the oboe, it is a double-reed instrument, although to facilitate the playing action (the instrument is normally held across and in front of the body) it is connected to the bassoon via a silver-plated, curved crook. Its most notorious cousin is the Baroque serpent, shaped very much as its name would suggest. \n Brass Instruments \n Brass instruments are also activated by blowing into them, although instead of using a form of reed over which the mouth is placed, the lips are placed against or", "parametric_answer": "cor anglais", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

So far the pensions regulator has not accepted the money. \n The man who bought BHS, a venture capitalist with a rather mixed track record, Dominic Chappell, is reported to have taken substantial professional fees and other costs out of the Company he was meant to be trying to save. \n The 11,000 BHS employees face the sack (their wages are only guaranteed for this month) and if their pension enters the Pension Protection Fund they will see that reduced as well. \n Of course tough though this is they can do something about it.

Under his leader- ship, the firm expanded out of its origins in mining and became a conglomerate, dealing in newspapers, hotels, distribution, textiles and many other lines of business.

LancashireLancashire (, ;  archaically the County Palatine of Lancaster; abbreviated Lancs.) is a non-metropolitan ceremonial county in north west England.  The county town is Lancaster although the county's administrative centre is Preston and has a population of 1,449,300 and an area of 1189 sqmi. People from the county are known as Lancastrians. \n The history of Lancashire begins with its founding in the 12th century. In the Domesday Book of 1086, some of its lands were treated as part of Yorkshire.  The land that lay between the Ribble and Mersey, Inter Ripam et Mersam was included in the returns for Cheshire.  When its boundaries were established, it bordered Cumberland, Westmorland, Yorkshire and Cheshire. \n Lancashire emerged as a major commercial and industrial region during the Industrial Revolution.  Manchester and Liverpool grew into its largest cities, dominating global trade and the birth of modern capitalism.  The county contained several mill towns and the collieries of the Lancashire Coalfield.  By the 1830s, approximately 85% of all cotton manufactured worldwide was processed in Lancashire.  Accrington, Blackburn, Bolton, Burnley, Bury, Chorley, Colne, Darwen, Nelson, Oldham, Preston, Rochdale and Wigan were major cotton mill towns during this time. Blackpool was a centre for tourism for the inhabitants of Lancashire's mill towns, particularly during wakes week. \n The county was subject to significant boundary reform in 1974George, D., Lancashire, (1991) that removed Liverpool and Manchester and most of their surrounding conurbations to form the metropolitan counties of Merseyside", "parametric_answer": "accrington stanley", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

Berkshire's brutal battles for democracy - BBCBBC - Berkshire - Entertainment - Berkshire's brutal battles for democracy \n Berkshire's brutal battles for democracy \n Emma Midgley \n Few people living in Newbury and Reading would imagine that English democracy was born on Berkshire battlefields. But these towns were the scenes of bloody fighting during the English Civil War. \n Jon Day, an expert in the English Civil War, claims that the battle of Reading and the  two battles of Newbury, were pivotal in the downfall of King Charles I and the birth of Britain as a democratic nation. \n The victory of the Parliamentarians in the English civil war led to the execution of King Charles I and the abolition of the monarchy in 1649 for 11 years until its restoration in 1660. \n English Civil War \n The English civil war was caused by fundamental differences between King Charles I and his parliament  over differences in religion, government and control of the army. \n Wash Common in Newbury \n Three key battles of the war were fought in Berkshire, which was of great strategic importance as it lay between the headquarters of the Parliamentarian army based in London and King Charles I's Royalist army's headquarters in Oxford. \n Bitter conflict \n According to Jon, the English civil war was a bitter conflict. \n He said: \"This war bore similarities to the civil conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s. \n \"The battles in Berkshire were extremely important. One battle in Newbury involved 25,000 soldiers on both sides.  There was very vicious fighting, there was slaughter of prisoners, civilians suffered from marauding armies and this was exacerbated by plague and disease. \n \"There was vicious fighting. People in Berkshire would have lived in fear. \" \n Jon Day \n \"People in Berkshire would have been living in fear. \n \"The armies were like plagues of locusts and they relied on living off the land to survive.\" \n Battle of Reading \n The first of these momentous battles was the Battle of Reading in early 1644, in which Parliamentary forces seized the Royalist-held town after fierce fighting around Caversham Bridge. The battle ended with a negotiated surrender highly unfavourable to the Royalists. \n Jon said: \"The Royalist commander feared criticism of the deal he'd got so much that he pretended to have been knocked unconscious by a falling chimney pot. \n \"His deputy, who took responsibility for the decision, was condemned to death by the king, although reprieved later.\" \n First Battle of Newbury \n The first battle of Newbury took place on 20 September 1643. This battle represented King Charles' best chance to win a decisive victory. \n The sides were evenly matched, but the Royalists were outfought by a Parliamentarian army in Enborn and Wash Common. The king then lost his nerve and withdrew. \n Jon said: \"King Charles I was squeamish over casualties, which was laudable. \n \"However, had the king won the first Battle of Newbury, the way in which Britain developed would have been very different. \n \"This was the turning point, at which we could have become an autocracy or stayed a democracy. \n \"I think that democracy was saved in the fields around Newbury and I don't think there are too many counties other than Berkshire that can say the same thing.\" \n Second Battle of Newbury \n During the following year, at the second battle", "parametric_answer": "reading", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

Created by Simon Cowell, the show began in 2004 and has since aired annually from August/September until December. The show is produced by FremantleMedia's Thames (previously Talkback Thames) and Cowell's production company Syco TV. It is broadcast on the ITV network in the United Kingdom and simulcast on TV3 in Ireland. The \"X Factor\" refers to the undefinable \"something\" that makes for star quality. The series consists of auditions, bootcamp, judges' houses, several weeks of live shows, semi-finals and the final. After the show's success, it then became an international franchise following a similar format. The series has a spin-off behind-the-scenes show called The Xtra Factor, which airs directly after the main show on ITV2. \n The original judging panel consisted of Louis Walsh, Sharon Osbourne and Cowell. Brian Friedman replaced Walsh in series 4, which also saw Dannii Minogue join the panel. However, Friedman left during the auditions and Walsh returned. Cheryl Cole took the place of Osbourne in series 5. Gary Barlow, Kelly Rowland and Tulisa joined the panel in series 8 as replacements for Cowell, Minogue, and Cole. However, Rowland left before series 9 and was replaced by Nicole Scherzinger. Osbourne returned to the panel in series 10, replacing Tulisa. Cowell and Cole (now Fernandez-Versini) returned to replace Barlow and Osbourne in series 11, while Mel B replaced Scherzinger. In series 12, Mel B and Walsh were replaced by Rita Ora and Nick Grimshaw. In series 13, Walsh, Osbourne and Scherzinger returned, replacing Grimshaw, Fernandez-Versini and Ora. The first three series were presented by Kate Thornton, then from the fourth to eleventh series, the show was presented by Dermot O'Leary, he then returned from the thirteenth series. In series 12, the show was presented by Caroline Flack and Olly Murs. Also, in series 10, Flack served as a backstage presenter during the Saturday night live shows. Roman Kemp will begin serving as the digital presenter of the show in series 13. The show is split into different stages, following the contestants from auditions through to the final. In the original televised audition stage of the show, contestants sang in an audition room in front of just the judges, but from the sixth series onwards, auditionees sing on a stage in front of the judges and a live audience. In series 10 and 11, both auditions formats were used. In series 12, the room auditions were scrapped, leaving just the arena auditions. The room auditions were revived in series 13, and no arena auditions followed. Successful auditionees go through to \"bootcamp\" and then to \"judges' houses\", where judges narrow down the acts in their category down to three or four acts to mentor for the live shows, where the public vote for their favourite acts following weekly live performances by the contestants. \n There have been twelve winners of the show to date: Steve Brookstein, Shayne Ward, Leona Lewis, Leon Jackson, Alexandra Burke, Joe McElderry, Matt Cardle, Little Mix, James Arthur, Sam Bailey, Ben Haenow, and Louisa Johnson. Winners receive a recording contract with record label Syco Music with a stated value of £1 million.

The band, which was one of the first \"super-groups\", released their only album, Blind Faith, in August 1969. They were stylistically similar to the bands in which Winwood, Baker, and Clapton had most recently participated, Traffic and Cream. \n The beginnings of Blind Faith date from mid-1968, with the break-up of Cream. In retrospect as the first \"super-group\", Cream had become a financial powerhouse, selling millions of records within a few years and raising the group's (and each member's) repertoire to international popularity. Despite that success, the band were crumbling from within because of frequent animosity between Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, with Eric Clapton doing his best to mediate. In addition, Clapton had been tired of being coerced into playing commercially driven blues and hoped to move forward with a new, experimental, less straitjacketed approach to the genre. \n Steve Winwood was facing similar problems in The Spencer Davis Group, where he had been the lead singer for three years.

Featuring Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker, and Steve Winwood, and, a few months later, Ric Grech, the band had all eyes from the music world squarely on them, as Blind Faith’s debut was easily one of the most anticipated moments in music history. No one would know how quickly the promise of magic to come would turn into a tale of potential wasted, even though the writing was on the wall from the beginning. \n Eric Clapton would eventually come to be near-deified as one of the greatest guitarists of all time. His insane focus on practice caused him to kicked out of school and earn a living by busking for change on the streets at age 17. Around that time, he joined his first band, and barely two years later he joined what was to be THE band for British blues guitar players, The Yardbirds. His brief tenure in the band preceded Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page‘s stints on six string duties, but it made it clear Clapton was a guitarist to watch.  \n The Yardbirds “For Your Love“ \n Clapton left The Yardbirds the day “For Your Love” was released, quickly joining, quitting and subsequently rejoining John Mayall‘s band The Bluesbreakers. It was fairly obvious to sharp eyed members of the music scene at the time that Clapton was not one to grow roots in any single musical situation. He wanted to play the blues, to follow the muse that drove him, and was dead set on doing it his way. When drummer Ginger Baker invited him to join his new band Cream, with former fellow Bluesbreaker Jack Bruce on bass, he quickly agreed. \n Ginger Baker had gained fame through his explosive gigs with The Graham Brand Organization.  A student of one of the great British jazz drummers, Phil Seamen, Baker brought an aggressive energy, a rarely seen double bass drum set up, and an ability to blend genres.

Micallef Best Selling Military History and World Affairs Author and Keynote Speaker \n Germany and the Irish Easter Rebellion \n Irish nationalists manning a baricade in Dublin during the Easter uprising \n During the First World War Germany and its allies adopted a strategy of fomenting rebellion in many of Great Britain's far-flung colonies as a way of weakening Britain's military capabilities. Enver Pasha, the Ottoman Minister for War, focused on inciting rebellion among the Muslim subjects of the British Empire. Berlin, on the other hand, tried to use Irish and Indian nationalists in a similar way. \n Germany also attempted to use a variation of this strategy to try to incite a war between Mexico and the United States, as well as to recruit German-Americans to fight on Germany's behalf. That gambit would backfire disastrously when its disclosure in the Zimmerman telegram paved the way for the American intervention into World War I on behalf of the Allies. \n Within days of the start of World War I, Irish nationalists reached out to Germany for support in their struggle for Irish Independence. In early August of 1914, Sir Roger Casement, a former British diplomat of Irish extraction, and John Devoy, the head of the nationalist Clan na Gael, met in New York with Germany's Ambassador to the United States, Count Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff. At the meeting the Irish nationalists proposed to organize an Irish revolt against Great Britain if Germany would sell guns to the Irish revolutionaries and provide officers to organize and train an Irish military force. \n On September 13, 1914, in Washington DC, Casement met with Franz von Papen, the German military attaché, to again seek Germany's support. At that meeting, Casement suggested that an Irish Brigade be organized from among the Irish prisoners of war from the British Army that had been captured by the Central Powers. The Brigade, he proposed, would fight alongside German troops against Great Britain and the Allies. \n A month later, in October 1914, Casement, styling himself an Ambassador of the Irish nation, traveled to Germany, via Norway, to meet with officials in the German government. On December 27, 1914, in Berlin, Casement signed an agreement with German Secretary of State Arthur Zimmermann formally authorizing the creation of the Irish Brigade. The German government subsequently issued a declaration supporting Irish independence and hinting they might land an army in Ireland, someday, to advance the cause of Irish sovereignty. \n The Brigade would be trained by the Germans and were to receive their own uniforms. Eventually, they would be made available to return to Ireland to fight against the British there. An Irish Brigade was in fact ultimately organized. Only 56 Irish POWs, out of the approximately 2,000 then being held in Germany, volunteered, however--far less than the usual 3,000-man strength of a brigade sized force.  The men were sent to a POW camp in Limburg for training and eventually attached to the 203rd Brandenburg Regiment. \n Roger Casement and John Devoy \n By the time of the Easter Rebellion in April 1916, however, the Irish Brigade had been dissolved. There is some evidence that Casement also had some involvement in a similar effort to recruit and organize an Indian brigade from among Hindu POWs held by the Germans. Dubbed the Hindu-German conspiracy, it sought German assistance to win Indian independence. \n With the ongoing Battle of Verdun in full swing and Britain preparing for a new offensive on the Somme, Irish nationalists decided to organize a rebellion against British rule. Roger Casement traveled to Berlin to once again try to obtain German support for the planned uprising. He asked for 40,000 rifles to arm the Irish nationalists, as well as German officers to train them.

Photo P Neesam, courtesy A1 Steam Locomotive Trust \n (Sorry for the cut off buffer. That’s the way the photo was cropped when we received it. Ed.) \n Tornado, the first new main line steam locomotive to be built in Britain for almost 50 years, will haul her first passenger train on the Network Rail main line from York to Newcastle-upon-Tyne and return on Saturday 31st January 2009. This train, The Peppercorn Pioneer, is for the supporters of The A1 Steam Locomotive Trust who raised the funds to build the new Peppercorn class A1 steam locomotive over the past 19 years. \n The train is a repeat of the one hauled by the last Peppercorn class A1, 60145 Saint Mungo, on 31st December 1965 shortly before she was scrapped, and will consist of 13 carriages, equating to about 500 tons, and will run at up to 75mph. The new £3 million Peppercorn class A1 60163 Tornado will be wearing her new apple green livery with ‘British Railways’ on the tender as carried by the first 30 of the original 49 Peppercorn class A1s when built. \n Speaking about Tornado’s first passenger train on the Network Rail main line, Mark Allatt, chairman of The A1 Steam Locomotive Trust said: \n ‘Tornado’s’ first main line passenger train is the end of another chapter in the story of a project thatmany said could never be completed. In 1990 a group was formed with a vision and the determination to make it succeed – to build and operate a Peppercorn class A1 Pacific steam locomotive for main line and preserved railway use. 18 years later, and thanks to that shared vision and determination, ‘Tornado’ turned her wheels in anger for the first time on 1st August 2008 in front of the world’s press. It is thanks to our more than 2,000 regular monthly and other donors, our sponsors led by William Cook Cast Products Limited and the hard work of our volunteers and contractors that the project has achieved so much. The Trust is now looking to the great British public to help us keep ‘Tornado’ on the main line by making a donation, sponsoring a component, taking part in our covenant scheme and/or our £500,000 bond issue. \n On Saturday 31st January 2009, Tornado will follow the timings below from York to Newcastle and return: \n Departs York station at 12:07 \n Passes Northallerton at 12:36  Historic first departure from King's Cross - The A1 Steam ...Historic first departure from King's Cross - The A1 Steam Locomotive Trust - The A1 Steam Locomotive Trust \n Historic first departure from King’s Cross \n Friday, 10th April 2009 \n Tornado, the first new main line steam locomotive to be built in Britain for almost 50 years, will haul her historic first train from London’s King’s Cross station on Saturday 18th April 2009. This train, the Yorkshire Pullman, will run to York and will be the first time a once-familiar Peppercorn class A1 has departed from London’s King’s Cross Station for over 40 years. \n The Yorkshire Pullman name was first used on Monday 30th September 1935, and apart from the hiatus due to the Second World War, survived for some years after steam locomotives ceased to haul it.

{"question": "Associated with salmon fishing and whisky production, which is the second longest river in Scotland?", "answers": ["spey"], "context": "River SpeyThe River Spey (Scottish Gaelic: Uisge Spè) is a river in the northeast of Scotland. It is the ninth longest river in the United Kingdom, as well as the third longest and fastest-flowing river in Scotland. It is important for salmon fishing and whisky production. \n Etymology  \n The origins of its name are unclear though 'hawthorn river' has been suggested (from a word linked to the Brythonic 'yspyddad') as has a derivation from the pre-Celtic 'squeas' meaning vomit or gush. Ptolemy named the river on his map of c AD 150 as Tuesis. The name 'Spey' first appears in 1451.  \n Course \n The Spey is 107 miles long. It rises at over 1000 feet (300 m) at Loch Spey in Corrieyairack Forest in the Scottish Highlands, 10 miles (16 km) south of Fort Augustus. The river descends through Newtonmore and Kingussie, crossing Loch Insh before reaching Aviemore, giving its name to Strathspey. From there it flows the remaining 60 mi north-east to the Moray Firth, reaching the sea five miles west  of Buckie. \n On some sections of its course, the Spey changes course frequently, either gradually as a result of deposition and erosion from normal flow, or in a matter of hours as a result of spate. The Spey spates quickly due to its wide mountainous catchment area as a result of rainfall or snow-melt. \n Insh Marshes, areas of roughly two miles on either side of the Spey in the lower reaches are designated by Scottish Natural Heritage as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, as are the extensive shingle systems at Spey Bay. \n Tributaries  \n After leaving Loch Spey the river gathers numerous burns in the Corrieyarack, Sherramore and Glenshirra Forests. The first sizeable tributary is the Markie Burn which drops out of Glen Markie to the north to enter the waters of Spey impounded behind the Spey Dam. A further mile downstream the River Mashie enters from Strath Mashie to the south. \n The River Truim enters on the right bank a couple of miles above Newtonmore and the Highland Calder enters from Glen Banchor on the left bank at Spey Bridge at Newtonmore. At Kingussie the Spey is joined on its left bank by the River Gynack which runs through the town and 1.5 miles downstream it is joined by the River Tromie which enters on the right bank. \n The sizeable River Feshie joins on the right bank at Kincraig and the River Druie does likewise at Aviemore. \n Several miles downstream the River Nethy joins from the east near Nethy Bridge and the River Dulnain originating in the Monadhliath contributes a considerable flow from the west near Dulnain Bridge. \n Between Grantown-on-Spey  and Craigellachie, the Burn of Tulchan and Allt a Gheallaidh join from the west whilst the Spey's most important tributary, the River Avon joins from the east. The Allt Arder and Knockando Burn also join from the west near Knockando. \n The River Fiddich enters from the right at Craigellachie and the Burn of Rothes enters from the left at Rothes. Downstream more burns enter the Spey, the most important of which are the Burn of Mulben, Red Burn and Burn of Fochabers. \n Industry \n The river traditionally supported many local industries, from the salmon fishing industry to shipbuilding. At one stage, Garmouth functioned as the shipbuilding capital of the UK, with timber from the forests around Aviemore and Aberlour being rafted down to create wooden-hulled ships. \n The river is known by anglers for the quality of its salmon and trout fishing, including a particular form of fly fishing where the angler uses a double-handed fly rod to throw a 'Spey cast' whereby the fly and the line do not travel behind the fisher (thereby keeping these away from the bushes and trees lining the banks behind him or her). This type of cast was developed on the Spey. \n Speyside distilleries produce more whisky than any other region. \n The Speyside Way, a long-distance footpath, follows the river through some of Moray's most beautiful scenery. \n The River Spey is unusual in that its speed increases as it flows closer to the sea,", "parametric_answer": "tay", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}
{"question": "Which Latin word is used for a recess in a church wall containing a basin for washing holy vessels?", "answers": ["piscina"], "context": "10 Holes in the Wall - Prestbury10 Holes in the Wall \n CHURCH ARCHITECTURE by Edward Wyatt \n HOLES IN THE WALL \n STOUP \n A stoup is a stone basin used to hold holy water. Usually it was located just inside the church or on the right hand side of the porch near to the church entrance. Sometimes the stoup was supported on a shaft. On entering and leaving church the devout worshipper would dip the fingers of the right hand into the water and make the sign of the cross to indicate self-consecration and a renewal of baptismal vows. \"When thou comste to the holy place, Caste holy water in thy face.\" Not many stoups survived the Reformation. Good examples exist in Cornwall (St Endellion) and in Herts (Caldecote). There are a few examples in Gloucestershire, at Whitminster, Boxwell, and Leighterton. \n PISCINA (or lavacrum) \n A piscina is a niche containing a shallow stone bowl or drain which was       built into the wall of the chancel near the High Altar. They can be found       in different parts of the church, but always indicate the position of the       altar before changes occurred, eg from rebuilding. The design of piscinae       exhibit their period of construction. In the Norman period pillar piscinae       were popular, the basin being supported on a shaft. Piscinae were used by       the priests for washing the chalice and patens. The water drained into the       consecrated ground around the church. Towards the end of the 13th century       it became the rule for the priest not to wash his hands in the same drain       as the chalice, and so double drainers were built. Not common, but a pair       of piscinae can be seen at Brimpsfield and Hawkesbury. Sometimes a       credence shelf may be seen, used to hold the cruets which contain the       wine. \n Leigh - 14C piscina with credence shelf and crocketed       canopy \n AUMBRY \n This was a small cupboard or recess built into the south or east wall of a church, usually near the altar. Able to be locked they were used to hold the holy vessels, books or other sacred objects. On many can be seen rebates, for the doors, as well as grooves, for the shelves. Bibury church has nine aumbries, three of which are behind the altar. \n SEDILIA \n These were seats recessed into the south wall of the chancel. Usually there were three seats but sometimes two (Beverstone Castle) and occasionally four were built. Sedilia were used by the priest and his two assistants (deacon and sub-deacon) during the singing of the Gloria and Creed. Some, as at Tortworth, were stepped and decorated. The highest ranked seat was placed nearest the altar. Often a piscina was constructed to the east of the sedilia, at the same time and of the same design, so a harmonious unit was presented (Blockley). Sedilia occurred at every period but were grandest during the 14th century. Examples are at Tormarton, Marshfield, Slimbridge and Northleach. \n SQUINT (or HAGIOSCOPE) \n Often when churches were enlarged the view from the new transepts to the High Altar was blocked. Frequently a diagonal opening was made through the stone of the chancel arch to gain a view of the High Altar. This enabled chantry priests to synchronise their mass with that at the High Altar. Sometimes a similar opening was made for the ringer to know when to sound the sanctus bell. A few squints, as at North Cerney and Brimpsfield, were high enough for a man to walk through (passage squints). Other locations with squints in Gloucestershire include Stanton, Beverstone and Icomb. \n EASTER SEPULCHRE \n An Easter Sepulchre was a recess built on the north side of the chancel to accommodate the Host and Altar Crucifix during the period of fast and vigil from Good Friday to Easter morning. They are rare but a few from the 14th century have a rich canopy. Sometimes the lower panels were carved with sleeping Roman soldiers and the upper panels with scenes depicting the Resurrection.

For those two colors in the CIE system, the government leaves  them blank. \n Zachary Harden, 02 March 2010 \n Symbolism of the flag \n The Korean national flag is called Taegukki. The meaning of Korean National   Flag is very philosophical. The origin comes from the old oriental philosophy   called the theory of Um-Yang, in Chinese pronunciation Yin-Yang. Yin means   dark and cold, while Yang means bright and hot. The idea of Yin-Yang is   supposed to be originated from the old Korean philosophy of Samshin meaning   three gods. A very old book called Chuyok or Iching in Chinese, which was   written by (a) Chinese several thousands years ago, claims all objects and   events in the world are expressed by the movement of yin and yang. For   example, the moon is yin while the sun is yang; the earth is yin and the   heaven is yang; a woman is yin and a man is yang; the night is yin and the day   is yang; the winter is yin and the summer is yang, etc. Yin and yang are   relative. Therefore, A can be yin with respect to B while A can also be yang   with respect to C. For instance, the spring is yin w.r.t. the summer and it is   at the same time yang w.r.t. the winter. Yin and yang are opposite and   struggle each other while they cooperate in harmony. The harmonious state of   the movement of yin and yang is called Taeguki, or Taikukkki, Taichi in   Chinese, which is also the name of the Korean national flag, i.e. Taegukki. Ki   means a flag. (See the similarity between the concept of Yin-Yang-Taichi and   the dialectics of thesis-antithesis-synthesis.) The upper half circle, red, of   Taeguk means yang and the lower half circle, blue, means yin. They stand for   the state of harmony of yin and yang. \n The symbols, called Kwae, in the four corners, mean the principle of   movement and harmony. Basically, each Kwae consists of three bars that can be   either broken or unbroken bars. A broken bar stands for yin while an unbroken   bar stands for yang. For example, the upper left Kwae, called Kun, is composed   of three solid unbroken bars. And the lower left Kwae, called Yi, is composed   of two unbroken bars and one broken bar in between.

He loved hunting, traveling all over the world, and horse racing (a popular Windsor sport of today). He was 21 years old when he married Princess Alexandra of Denmark, the daughter of King Christian the IX. Alix, as she was known, was an elegant but shy girl who became a popular Princess of Wales. \n They had several children: Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence; Prince George, Duke of York; Louise, Princess Royal and Duchess of Fife; Princess Victoria; Princess Maud (became Queen of Norway); and Prince Alexander John of Wales. \n Prince Albert Victor, known as Eddy within the family, was the next in line for kingship. Unfortunately, the young man died of pneumonia, brought on by influenza, in January 1892. He was only 28 years old. The next in line for the throne was George, the Duke of York. \n Though his family was happy, and as lovely as Alexandra was, it did not keep Edward faithful. He had many mistresses, one of the most famous being Alice Keppel. She was the great-great-grandmother of Prince Charles’s wife, Camilla. Alix learned to live with his ways, but Edward’s mother, Queen Victoria, constantly fretted about his personal affairs affecting his public life. She even blamed his numerous indiscretions as the cause for the early death of Prince Albert, who succumbed to typhoid fever at the age of 42. The Queen felt that the best course of action for what she viewed as a gross injustice was to keep personal government documents away from Edward, which served only to increase Edward’s fondness for extracurricular activities while he waited to succeed his thriving mother. \n Though Edward was flirtatious and had a knack for gambling, he proved to be a responsible King once crowned at age 59. He could speak fluent German and French, and was also a force in the creation of the Entente Cordiale. Edward was soon known as the “Uncle of Europe”. \n The Entente Cordiale was an Anglo-French agreement signed in 1904, just three short years into Edward’s reign. It ended the traditional enmity between Great Britain and France (the French helped the British colonies rebel against their Mother Country. Britain was none too pleased). The diplomatic peace helped the two stand firm against increasing German aggression. The German Kaiser Wilhelm II, Edward’s nephew, watched with a mixture of awe and jealousy as his uncle became Britain’s national treasure. \n The King took the monarchy to new heights of public esteem. After their father, Prince Albert, died of typhoid, Queen Victoria forbade her children celebrating any events. Even official duties were to be performed with the least amount of pomp possible. Once King, Edward and Queen Alexandra opened Parliament, held grand balls and shooting parties, and celebrated weddings and holidays.

{"question": "'Wilson, the Wonder Athlete' who was still breaking world records at the age of 128, first appeared in 1933 in which boy's comic?", "answers": ["hotspur"], "context": "Wilson the Wonder AthleteWilson the Wonder Athlete or William Wilson is a fictional character whose adventures were initially published in the British illustrated story paper The Wizard published by D. C. Thomson & Co. \n Publication history \n The character first appeared in issue 1029 Wizard (24 July 1943) in a story titled \"The Truth About Wilson\". The first adventure introduced Wilson as a supreme athlete, who joins a race from out of the crowd and manages to record a three-minute mile.  The character's adventures were written by Gilbert Lawford Dalton using the pen name W S K Webb, and a book, The Truth About Wilson collected a number of the text stories in the 1960s.   Thought by Paul Gravett to be the prototype of the \"astonishing sporting prodigies\" who became popular in British comics, (cf. Alf Tupper, Roy of the Rovers), Gravett describes him as an \"unassuming totally dedicated loner, [wanting] no glory or publicity\".   Although his stories were initially told in prose, a move to the comic papers The Hornet and  Hotspur saw the character depicted in comic strip form.  The character was later revived for D.C. Thomson's Spike comic of 1983 to 1984, initially within a comic strip with art by Neville Wilson.  Referred to as The Man in Black, the character was revealed to be Wilson in the course of the story, with reprints of the older material published within the comic as Wilson's diaries.  \n Fictional character biography \n William Wilson was born in the village of Stayling in Yorkshire and claimed to be born on 1 November 1795. However a document dated 11 March 1774 listed him as \"clerk to the manor\". He was sufficiently old that when writing, he used an \"f\" instead of an \"s\". His farmer father died in middle age, leaving Wilson £5,000. He studied medicine and biology in a number of countries around the world and determined not to die early as so many he knew had, he worked out a health and fitness regime and learned how to slow his heart right down, using a formula created by people who could live to over 200. He developed his will power and hardened his body by whole winters spent in the open. Squadron leader W. Wilson D.S.O., D.F.C. and bar, who had 25 victories to his name, was shot down during the Second World War and was officially listed as missing. \n The character is depicted within stories as performing a number of improbable events. Wilson was seen in one strip becoming the first man to climb Everest, and another saw him captaining an England cricket team to The Ashes in Australia.   Depicted as being born in 1795, he is given the secret of eternal life by a hermit.  Originally hailing from Yorkshire, and living in a cave on a diet of nuts and berries, Wilson exemplified British grit and the stiff upper lip.  According to The Guardian he \"was hailed as a welcome wartime morale booster\", while The Telegraph remembers him as a \"focused and intense individual ... [with no] recorded instance of him smiling or cracking a joke.\"  In 2004 artist John Reynolds acquired the licence to reproduce images of Wilson as large screen-print canvases. Former Guinness Book of Records deputy editor and athletics statistician, Ian Smith, cites the character as an inspiration, and he inspired many British athletes in their careers as well as Belgian cyclist Eddy Merckx.

When the change was made there were no less than six kinds of United States paper currency, but only three months later the stock market crash ushered in the era of the Great Depression, during which three of those kinds of currency would disappear.  Thirty years later, two of the remaining kinds of currency would also disappear, leaving only one. \n The six kinds of currency in 1929, colored coded with the colors of their seals and serial numbers, and with the denominations they were issued in series 1928 and 1929 (though not always in those years themselves), were: \n United States Notes (Series 1928:  $1 $2 $5) Go! \n Gold Certificates (Series 1928: $10 $20 $50 $100 $500 $1000 $5000 $10,000) Go! \n National Bank Notes (Series 1929: $5 $10 $20 $50 $100) Go! \n Silver Certificates (Series 1928: $1) Go! \n Federal Reserve Bank Notes (Series 1929: $5 $10 $20 $50 $100) Go! \n Federal Reserve Notes (Series 1928: $5 $10 $20 $50 $100 $500 $1000 $5000 $10,000) Go! \n The three kinds of currency that remained after the Depression were: \n United States Notes (Series 1953: $2 $5) Go! \n Silver Certificates (Series 1953: $5 $10 -- Series 1957: $1) Go! \n Federal Reserve Notes (Series 1950: $5 $10 $20 $50 $100) Go! \n And all that remained by 1970 were: \n Federal Reserve Notes (Series 1969: $1 $5 $10 $20 $50 $100 -- Series 1976: $2) Go! \n . \n The origin and nature of these kinds of currency will be considered below.  Although the color of the seals and serial numbers on Gold Certificates was yellow, here orange is used for greater contrast.  The reverse of large note Gold Certificates had actually been orange, \"goldbacks\" as opposed to \"greenbacks\"; but small note Gold Certificates were made \"greenbacks\" also.  (That was reversed with series 1934 Gold Certificates, which again had orange reverses, but those notes never circulated to the public). \n That was part of a process to unify the design of all the currency.  The variety of large note design gave way to common elements and a common look for the small notes.  This changed little over the years, until a radically redesigned $100 bill was introduced in the 1990's, inaugurating a gradual change in all the currency for security reasons.  United States currency had never featured anti-counterfeiting devices like watermarked paper and security threads, which had appeared in foreign money decades earlier. \n All the small notes featured a portrait of Washington for the $1 note, Jefferson for $2, Lincoln for $5, Hamilton for $10, Jackson for $20, Grant for $50, Franklin for $100, McKinley for $500, Cleveland for $1000, Madison for $5000, and Chase for the $10,000.  When one series of $100,000 notes was issued (1934 Gold Certificates), Wilson was put on them.  Although these portraits are often called \"dead presidents,\" three of them, Hamilton, Franklin, and Chase, were never Presidents.

{"question": "\"By what 4 letter word is the \"\"bulb\"\" of a crocus more correctly known?\"", "answers": ["corm"], "context": "CrocusCrocus (English plural: crocuses or croci) is a genus of flowering plants in the iris family comprising 90 species of perennials growing from corms. Many are cultivated for their flowers appearing in autumn, winter, or spring. Crocuses are native to woodland, scrub, and meadows from sea level to alpine tundra in central and southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, on the islands of the Aegean, and across Central Asia to Xinjiang Province in western China.[http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/namedetail.do?name_id \n 327117 Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families]   \n Etymology \n The name of the genus is derived from the Grek κρόκος (krokos).  This, in turn, is probably a loan word from a Semitic language, related to Hebrew כרכום karkōm, Aramaic ܟܟܘܪܟܟܡܡܐ kurkama, and Arabic كركم kurkum, which mean \"saffron\" (Crocus sativus), \"saffron yellow\" or turmeric (see Curcuma).  The word ultimately traces back to the Sanskrit kunkumam (कुङ्कुमं) for \"saffron\" unless it is itself descended from the Semitic one. The English name is a learned 16th-century adoption from the Latin, but Old English already had croh \"saffron\".  \n History \n Cultivation and harvesting of Crocus sativus for saffron was first documented in the Mediterranean, notably on the island of Crete. Frescos showing them are found at the Knossos site on Crete,  as well as from the comparably aged Akrotiri site on Santorini. \n The first crocus seen in the Netherlands, where crocus species are not native, were from corms brought back in the 1560s from Constantinople by the Holy Roman Emperor's ambassador to the Sublime Porte, Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq. A few corms were forwarded to Carolus Clusius at the botanical garden in Leiden. By 1620, the approximate date of Ambrosius Bosschaert's painting (illustration, below), new garden varieties had been developed, such as the cream-colored crocus feathered with bronze at the base of the bouquet, similar to varieties still on the market. Bosschaert, working from a preparatory drawing to paint his composed piece spanning the whole of spring, exaggerated the crocus so that it passes for a tulip, but its narrow, grass-like leaves give it away. \n Image:Cueilleuse de safran, fresque, Akrotiri, Grèce.jpg|Saffron gatherers appear in Minoan frescos on the island of Santorini in the Aegean Sea.   \n File:Ambrosius Bosschaert, the Elder 03.jpg|Composed Bouquet of Spring Flowers, by Ambrosius Bosschaert, circa 1620 (Louvre Museum) \n Image:Crocus-angustifolius.jpg|Crocus angustifolius (Cloth of gold) from Curtis's Botanical Magazine, 1803 \n Description \n The cup-shaped, solitary, salverform flower tapers off into a narrow tube.  Their colors vary enormously, although lilac, mauve, yellow, and white are predominant. The grass-like, ensiform leaf  shows generally a white central stripe along the leaf axis. The leaf margin is entire. Crocuses typically have three stamens.  The spice saffron is obtained from the stigmas of Crocus sativus, an autumn-blooming species. \n Autumn crocus \n Some species, known as \"autumn crocus\", flower in late summer and autumn, often before their leaves appear. They should not be confused with a different genus of autumn-flowering plants, Colchicum. Autumn-flowering species of crocus include: \n C. laevigatus has a long flowering period which starts in late autumn or early winter and may continue into February. \n Species  \n The taxonomic classification proposed by Brian Mathew in 1982 was based mainly on three character states:  \n *the presence or absence of a prophyll (a basal spathe); \n *the aspect of the style; \n *the corm tunic.  \n The seven species discovered since then have been integrated into this classification.  \n Molecular analysis carried out at the University of Copenhagen suggests this classification should be reviewed. In particular, the DNA data suggest there are no grounds for isolating C. banaticus in its own subgenus Crociris, though it is a unique species in the genus. Because it has a prophyll at the base of the pedicel, it therefore would fall within section Crocus, although its exact relationship to the rest", "parametric_answer": "tube", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

Permanent Press fabrics have been treated with chemicals to ensure they resist wrinkles and retain their original shape. If a piece of clothing is permanent press, it usually means that you shouldn’t iron it. \n The Gentle Cycle symbol has two lines beneath the standard wash symbol. The gentle cycle is for delicate fibres like wool or silk, or for items of clothing that could be damaged by a vigorous washing (like sequined tops, tights, or lycra). \n The Hand Wash symbol is the standard wash symbol with a hand at the top. For ‘Hand Wash’ clothing, do not use a washing machine. Instead wash garments in a sink or small tub, using your hands to ensure that the cleaning liquid is thoroughly rubbed into the material and subsequently rinsed out. Check your cleaning liquid to make sure it is suitable for hand-washing – milder detergents have been specifically designed for hand wash use, and they are safe for your clothes and for your hands! \n The Do Not Wash symbol is the standard wash symbol with a cross through it. If the label instructs you not to wash the item, it will have to be dry cleaned after it gets dirty – see the section on Dry Cleaning Symbols below. \n Bleaching Guidelines on Clothing Labels \n The next symbol on the clothes label is a triangle that refers to whether specific bleaching conditions are required for the item. \n A triangle without anything in the middle means that any kind of bleach can be used on the clothing when needed. \n A triangle filled with diagonal lines means that only non-chlorine bleaches should be used. Check the ingredients on your bleach to see if it contains chlorine. \n A solid black triangle with crossed lines means ‘do not bleach’ – you should not attempt to use any kind of bleach on this garment. \n Drying Guidelines on Clothing Labels \n The basic tumble dryer symbol is a square with a circle in the middle of it. \n As with the symbols for washing clothes, the number of dots inside the circle will tell you the heat setting you should put your tumble dryer on to, as well as any specific program settings required. Three dots mean Tumble Dry High. \n Two dots means Tumble Dry Medium. \n One dot means Tumble Dry Low. \n When an item is marked as ‘do not tumble dry’ with a cross through the drying symbol, leave this garment to drip-dry on a drying rack, in an airing cupboard, or outside on your washing line rather than putting it in the dryer. \n Again, a single line below the dryer symbol means that a Permanent Press setting should be used. \n Double lines indicate that the Delicate setting must be used. \n Ironing Guidelines on Garment Labels \n To make life easy, the ironing symbol is shaped like an old-fashioned iron. \n  Ironing symbols also employ the same dot system for heat levels, which should be adjustable on your iron: three dots mean that the item can be ironed on high. \n Two dots mean that it can be ironed on medium. \n One dot means that it can be ironed on low. \n   \n Dry Cleaning Guidelines on Garment Labels \n The dry cleaning symbol is a circle. \n  For clothes that are dry clean only, the circle has a letter ‘P’ inside it. \n The clothes that should be dry-cleaned under normal conditions will have a letter ‘F’ inside the circle. \n A crossed-out circle means that you should not dry-clean the item: \n And there you have it!

The central character was Lord Marmaduke of Bunkerton, known to his friends as Snooty, a very ordinary boy who just happens to be an Earl, and is always assisted by his butler Parkinson. \n Character history \n Original run (1938–1991) \n The strip was mostly drawn by Dudley D. Watkins until his death in 1969, though Leo Baxendale and Albert Holroyd occasionally filled in for Watkins. The strip had an 18-month hiatus from the comic between June 1949 and December 1950. It was at this point that Snooty's original pals (from Ash Can Alley) were replaced with his new pals who lived in the castle. Some of these had previously appeared in other Beano strips. The strip had another hiatus from 1958 to 1959, before the comic began reprinting older Lord Snooty strips. Watkins returned to drawing the strip in 1964, before Robert Nixon took over in 1968. Nixon continued to draw it for the next few years, before being succeeded by Jimmy Glen in 1973. Ken H. Harrison took over in 1988, and continued to draw it until the strip disappeared from The Beano in 1991. Lord Snooty was the only remaining strip left from the first issue when it was withdrawn. \n Subsequent appearances (2000s) \n On 9 September 1998, a book entitled The Legend of Lord Snooty and his Pals (ISBN 0-85116-691-1) was released. This contained a history and reprints from the first 30 years of the strip's life. \n In 2000, Lord Snooty made a special appearance in the Bash Street Kids Book 2001, along with Snitch and Snatch. \n Snooty also appeared in issue 3093 (dated 27 October 2001) where a one off strip called 'Lord Snooty's Day Out' appeared (drawn by Ken H. Harrison), and in issue 3185 (dated 2 August 2003) where as part of the 65th anniversary issue he made a guest appearance alongside The Bash Street Kids. Big Fat Joe also guest appeared in that issue, alongside Billy Whizz. \n In 2005 Snooty was revived, briefly, in the Beano serial Are We There Yet? by writer-artist Kev F Sutherland, in which he goes hip-hop as Snoot Doggy-Dogg. the character was often acknowledged but didn't come to prominence again until he was used as a villain for a feature length Bash Street Kids story again illustrated and written by Kev F Sutherland. The plot saw him, and a few other retro Beano characters such as Keyhole Kate and Pansy Potter, trying to take over The Beano and return it to its post-war roots.

It’s also known as herb of grace, or herbygrass, from its use in the early Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water and wash away sins. (Hyssop was the herb of choice in the Middle Ages, but rue was also used, perhaps because of its long-standing reputation as a disinfectant.) The custom derived from a Roman ceremony (using a laurel branch) to purify weapons and standards following a battle. \n Rue is associated with sorrow, regret and compassion only in the English language. When the Romans introduced the rue herb plant to England, they called it by its Latin name (now the generic name), Ruta. When Anglicized and shortened to “rue,” the name sounded just like the word meaning “sorrow,” but that word comes from an Old English word, hreow. (Some believe that the word Ruta comes from a Greek word meaning “to set free.”) The specific name, graveolens, is Latin for “having a strong or offensive smell” (dill is Anethum graveolens). Whether rue’s odor is either strong or offensive is open to debate; usually, it’s described as “musty.” Ruta is the genus belonging to the family Rutaceae, members of which include aromatic citrus trees as well as gas plant", "parametric_answer": "basil", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

It has itsorigin in electric currents and the fundamental magnetic moments of elementary particles. These give rise to amagnetic field that acts on other currents and moments. All materials are influenced to some extent by a magneticfield. The strongest effect is on permanent magnets, which have persistent magnetic moments caused byferromagnetism. Most materials do not have permanent moments. Some are attracted to a magnetic field(paramagnetism); others are repulsed by a magnetic field (diamagnetism); others have a much more complexrelationship with an applied magnetic field (spin glass behavior and antiferromagnetism).

Neither passport nor visas guarantee entry into a foreign country -this is always ultimately subject to the discretion of the immigration officer at the border. \n Even if you do not travel, passports can be used in your home country as evidence of your identity.  This is useful for opening a bank account among other things. \n Contents[ edit ] \n The first convention on passports was when, in 1920, the League of Nations decided that all passports contain information in French, being the diplomatic language of that era. Today all passports contain information in at least English or French, as well as the official language(s) of the issuing nation (if not English or French). \n The cover page includes the word \"passport\" and the name of the the issuing country in the native language(s) of the issuing country(and possibly a second language, such as English); some sort of national symbol; and special, universal symbol if it is biometric. Additionally, all EU member states have \"European Union\" (perhaps in another language) above the name of the issuing country. \n The information page of the passport records basic information about the passport: its bearer's surname, given names, photo and date and place of birth, validity period, issuing authority, place of issue and passport number, and the dates the passport was issued and will expire. Most passports also contain a request for safe passage and right to consul in event of incarceration.  Most passports issued in recent years have a machine-readable strip at the bottom of the page to expedite encoding at the relevant stations (see the relevant section below). \n In some countries, the next pages are for amendments where the bearer country's issuing may place travel restrictions, change conditions for travel abroad, or amend the period of validity. In addition, pages may be included which provide helpful legal and practical information for the bearer. For instance a US passport contains 6 pages regarding websites and contacts for various reasons (travel restrictions, treasury restrictions on imports, paying taxes while in a foreign country, registering your stay in a foreign country), common sense subjects (don't be a target, be mindful of security threats, ways to lose citizenship), and important information (loss, theft, destruction, alteration, or mutilation of the passport, what to do in a natural disaster or catastrophic event, etc). \n Most of the passport pages are allotted for visas where visas coming from different embassies or consulates are pasted. Stamps from passport control officers of both the bearer's home country and countries visited revealing the history of entry and exit of those countries are also found on these pages. \n Extra pages[ edit ] \n Some countries, such as the US, allow the addition of extra pages to passports. Some countries require 2 blank pages in your passport before you enter the country. If you are running low on blank pages and have a passport from a country that permits the addition of extra pages, contact your nearest passport office, embassy, or consulate and they should be able to add extra pages for free or a fee depending on the issuing country. \n Other countries, such as Canada, can issue a special passport with 48 pages instead of the usual 24 for frequent travellers, Canada does not allow extra pages to be added later, so this is definitely worth doing if you expect to travel a lot. The new E-Passports only have 36 pages which is the only option. \n Some countries may issue a new passport \"cross-linked\" (or even physically bound) to the old one.

Permanent Press fabrics have been treated with chemicals to ensure they resist wrinkles and retain their original shape. If a piece of clothing is permanent press, it usually means that you shouldn’t iron it. \n The Gentle Cycle symbol has two lines beneath the standard wash symbol. The gentle cycle is for delicate fibres like wool or silk, or for items of clothing that could be damaged by a vigorous washing (like sequined tops, tights, or lycra). \n The Hand Wash symbol is the standard wash symbol with a hand at the top. For ‘Hand Wash’ clothing, do not use a washing machine. Instead wash garments in a sink or small tub, using your hands to ensure that the cleaning liquid is thoroughly rubbed into the material and subsequently rinsed out. Check your cleaning liquid to make sure it is suitable for hand-washing – milder detergents have been specifically designed for hand wash use, and they are safe for your clothes and for your hands! \n The Do Not Wash symbol is the standard wash symbol with a cross through it. If the label instructs you not to wash the item, it will have to be dry cleaned after it gets dirty – see the section on Dry Cleaning Symbols below. \n Bleaching Guidelines on Clothing Labels \n The next symbol on the clothes label is a triangle that refers to whether specific bleaching conditions are required for the item. \n A triangle without anything in the middle means that any kind of bleach can be used on the clothing when needed. \n A triangle filled with diagonal lines means that only non-chlorine bleaches should be used. Check the ingredients on your bleach to see if it contains chlorine. \n A solid black triangle with crossed lines means ‘do not bleach’ – you should not attempt to use any kind of bleach on this garment. \n Drying Guidelines on Clothing Labels \n The basic tumble dryer symbol is a square with a circle in the middle of it. \n As with the symbols for washing clothes, the number of dots inside the circle will tell you the heat setting you should put your tumble dryer on to, as well as any specific program settings required. Three dots mean Tumble Dry High. \n Two dots means Tumble Dry Medium. \n One dot means Tumble Dry Low. \n When an item is marked as ‘do not tumble dry’ with a cross through the drying symbol, leave this garment to drip-dry on a drying rack, in an airing cupboard, or outside on your washing line rather than putting it in the dryer. \n Again, a single line below the dryer symbol means that a Permanent Press setting should be used. \n Double lines indicate that the Delicate setting must be used. \n Ironing Guidelines on Garment Labels \n To make life easy, the ironing symbol is shaped like an old-fashioned iron. \n  Ironing symbols also employ the same dot system for heat levels, which should be adjustable on your iron: three dots mean that the item can be ironed on high. \n Two dots mean that it can be ironed on medium. \n One dot means that it can be ironed on low. \n   \n Dry Cleaning Guidelines on Garment Labels \n The dry cleaning symbol is a circle. \n  For clothes that are dry clean only, the circle has a letter ‘P’ inside it. \n The clothes that should be dry-cleaned under normal conditions will have a letter ‘F’ inside the circle. \n A crossed-out circle means that you should not dry-clean the item: \n And there you have it!

On the eve of the coronation of King Rudolf of Ruritania, his brother, Prince Michael, has him drugged. In a desperate attempt not to give Michael the excuse to claim the throne, Colonel Sapt and Fritz von Tarlenheim, attendants of the King, persuade his distant cousin Rudolf Rassendyll, an English visitor, to impersonate the King at the coronation. The unconscious king is abducted and imprisoned in a castle in the small town of Zenda. There are complications, plots, and counter-plots, among them the schemes of Michael's mistress, Antoinette de Mauban, and those of his dashing but villainous henchman Count Rupert of Hentzau.  Rassendyll falls in love with Princess Flavia, the King's betrothed, but cannot tell her the truth. He determines to rescue the king and leads an attempt to enter the castle of Zenda. The King is rescued and is restored to his throne, but the lovers, in duty bound, must part.

With such heart felt ballads as \"If I Loved You\" and \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" it definitely ranks as one of the essential Hollywood musicals. Carousel is just about the only musical made during this period that deals with darker themes (i.e. date rape, domestic abuse). One could say that it even argues in favor of birth control. Carousel will never look dated because its themes are timeless and apply to the human spirit no matter what year it is. Everybody can identify with Billy to a degree and everybody can not help but feel a deep respect for Julie by the end of her personal journey. Fans of musical drama will treasure Carousel for years to come. \n excellent Rodgers and Hammerstein musical \n Reviewed bydidi-5Vote: 5/10 \n This is the musical which gave Gordon MacRae his greatest solo song, namely the 7 minutes long \"Soliloquy\", in which Billy the circus barker speculates about his unborn child, first with bluster and pride if it is a boy, and then with insecurity and despair if it is a girl he can't buy things for.  Billy, as we have seen in the opening sequence of the film, is telling his story to one of the angels in heaven, where he has gone after a violent and premature death.  So we see his tale unfold, as he meets pretty little Julie Jordan (Shirley Jones, excellent), marries her, and through fate and bad luck, gets separated from her.    The subject matter is darker than Oklahoma (the film version of which also starred MacRae and Jones) but the sheer exuberance of songs such as \"June is Bustin' Out All Over\"; \"A Real Nice Clambake\"; \"When The Children Are Asleep\" and \"If I Loved You\", plus of course the best-known song from the show, \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" takes the story to another level and makes this film enjoyable to watch.  Robert Rounsville makes a fine bombastic Mr Snow and has a fabulous voice; MacRae and Jones have their memorable duet to the lovely melody of Rodgers' score.  There is also an excellent dance sequence, not as extensive as on stage, but still effective, where the daughter of Billy and Julie imagines an escape from her lonely and ostracised life. \n Classic R&H Musical With Superb MacRae and Jones... \n Reviewed byNeil DoyleVote: 5/10 \n Rodgers & Hammerstein's brilliant stage musical comes to the screen with most of the music intact--and what songs they are. Each one is a gem and fully integrated into the tragic storyline. Gordon MacRae stars as Billy Bigelow, the amusement park barker who tries to change his life when he marries Julie Jordan (Shirley Jones)-- with tragic results. MacRae's robust baritone is showcased in his big number, 'Soliloquy', performed at seaside with the ocean backdrop. Only occasionally is the use of stagebound sets a jarring note--but overall, the look and feel of the movie is one of genuinely moving musical drama.  Delightful performances from Barbara Ruick and Robert Rounseville as Mr. and Mrs. Snow. Their 'When The Children Are Asleep' is a charming highlight. Claramae Turner does an outstanding job on 'You'll Never Walk Alone'. Cameron Mitchell is a slyly villainous Jigger.

There were no tabloid journalists hanging around the nearby village of Churchill, no paparazzi hiding in the bushes on the morning of June 13, the day Rebekah Wade, the editor of The Sun, Britain’s largest daily newspaper, celebrated her marriage to the former racehorse trainer and “international playboy” Charles Patrick Evelyn Brooks. \n The prime minister, Gordon Brown, and his wife, Sarah, attended, as did David Cameron, the Conservative Party leader and prime minister–to–be, and his wife, Samantha.

For the whole seven days and 900-odd miles of this test, I was absolutely convinced that I had only ever driven one previous example of the Kia Magentis. Subsequent research revealed, however, that I had actually driven three, and that two of them had obviously slipped my mind entirely. Knowing this, I'm surprised I was able to remember the current model long enough to be able to find it in a car park. \n In my defence I should say that there are few reasons to keep the Magentis in the forefront of one's mind. After all, it's not as if this car is a common sight on our roads. A Kia spokesperson recently described Magentis sales to me as \"pitiful\", and a look at the precise figures confirms this: the car's most successful year in the last six has been 2005, when 1124 were shifted, and the total for 2007 and 2008 combined was just 444. \n Part of the reason may be Kia's marketing of itself in this country as a manufacturer of small cars and SUVs. The Magentis, a medium-sized family saloon, is neither of these, so it doesn't really fit in with the rest of the range in the UK. But although it's by no means a great car - not even close - it's far better than the sales figures suggest. \n The Magentis has had an odd history. When it was launched, it was available only with a 2.5-litre V6 petrol engine (which incidentally gave it a refined feel that led several journalists to consider it at the time as an inexpensive alternative to a proper luxury car), but this has since been deleted on the grounds that absolutely nobody wanted it. A two-litre petrol engine also came and went, and now the only power source you can have is the rather splendid 148bhp two-litre turbo diesel also fitted to several other Kias. \n This engine is probably the best thing about the Magentis, which in most other respects is a reminder of the days when the main reason for buying any Kia was that it didn't involve spending much money. \n Compared with everything else the Korean company produces, the Magentis looks and feels old and cheap, with downmarket interior plastics and a wobbly gearlever (and, in the case of the test car, a passenger door mirror whose electric adjustment had already given up the ghost) contributing to the generally gloomy atmosphere. Compared with other D-segment models - let's say the Ford Mondeo or the Mazda6 - it seems like a cracked fossil of some prehistoric invertebrate that even the keenest geologist can't get excited about. \n But. Yet. However. The fact is that I have become rather fond of the Magentis. My initial impressions were not great, and at the start of this test I was prepared to grumble incessantly about the car. By the second day I'd realised I wasn't actually doing any grumbling, and thereafter I gradually came to the conclusion that I wouldn't mind if Kia forgot about this Magentis the way I had forgotten about the last two and left it with me for another few weeks. \n Why? Well, for a start, after some recent tweaking by Kia's celebrated design chief Peter Schreyer, it actually looks quite good in an old-fashioned sort of way - certainly better than it did after its 2003 facelift, which was just appalling, and better too than the overly-chromed original. \n The ride and handling, while nowhere near class-leading, are also an improvement over those of previous Magentises; there's a little too much bumpiness on some surfaces, but body movements are generally well controlled, and there is a certain amount of fun to be had on deserted country roads. \n And then there's the space.

In geology, two general landforms derive       their names from those of specific examples. Vulcano is the name of an       island in the Tyrrhenian Sea north of Sicily. Every volcano on the planet       owes its name to this small volcanic island. Geysir (Icelandic for \"gusher\") is the name of an erupting flow of heated water       from the ground in Iceland. The name, in the form geyser, is applied to       all such landforms that eject a column of hot water. \n Volcano and geyser share more than the fact they derive from eponyms. Both       arise as the result of volcanic activity. Whereas volcanoes spew lava       (called magma when it is beneath Earth's surface), geysers emit hot       water and steam. The activity of geysers is labeled hydrothermal (from the       Greek words hydro , meaning \"water,\" and therme , meaning \"heat\"). Hydrothermal activity also creates hot       springs, fumaroles, and mud pots. Some of these landforms emit small-scale       eruptions; all are beautiful and delicate. \n The shape of the land \n A geyser is considered a type of hot spring, which is a pool of hot water       that has seeped through a vent or opening in Earth's surface. By       definition, the temperature of the water is at least 15°F       (8.3°C) warmer than the average temperature of the surrounding air.       It can reach as high as 200°F (93°C). Normal hot springs do       not erupt, but may seem to churn and \"boil\" as gases from       underground pass through them. When the water that feeds a hot spring       passes through rocks underground, it may dissolve minerals from the rocks       and bring them to the surface. If those rocks are volcanic, then the water       carries silica to the surface. (Silica is the most abundant element found       in magma.) At the surface, the water cools and \n The Pohutu Geyser, New Zealand, rises up to 59 feet and is the most           significant in a major geyser field of more than five hundred hot           springs and other forms of geothermal activity. \n PHOTOGRAPH REPRODUCED BY PERMISSION OF \n PHOTO RESEARCHERS, INC. \n the silica forms geyserite (pronounced GUY-zuh-rite), a white or grayish       cauliflowerlike deposit that creates rims or terraces around the spring.       This deposit is also known as sinter. If the water passes through       limestone, then it carries calcium carbonate to the surface. There the       mineral crystallizes to form travertine (pronounced TRA-ver-teen). This       dense, white rock also creates ledges and other rock formations around the       spring. The water and rocks in hot springs may be multicolored. Brilliant       rings of red, blue, brown, green, orange, and yellow are formed by the       different species of algae and bacteria that flourish in the hot spring       environment. \n A geyser is a hot spring that periodically erupts through an opening in       Earth's surface, spewing hot water and steam up to hundreds of feet       above the ground. Essential geological conditions must be met for a geyser       to exist: among other conditions, it must have an abundant water supply,       an intense heat source, and a special plumbing system. Because of this,       geysers are rare. There are only approximately seven hundred geysers known       to exist on Earth. Yellowstone National Park, which lies in northwest       Wyoming and extends into Montana and Idaho, contains more than four       hundred geysers.

{"question": "Which comedian, whose real name was Charles Springall, reached number one in 1958 with 'Splish, Splash'?", "answers": ["charlie drake"], "context": "Charlie DrakeCharles Edward Springall, known professionally as Charlie Drake (19 June 1925 – 23 December 2006) was an English comedian, actor, writer and singer. \n With his small stature (5' 1\"/155 cm tall), curly red hair and liking for slapstick, he was a popular comedian with children in his early years, becoming nationally known for his \"Hello, my darlings!\" catchphrase. \n Early life \n Born Charles Edward Springall in the Elephant and Castle, Southwark, South London, he took his mother's maiden name for the stage and, later, television and film, achieving success as a comedian. \n Career \n Drake made his first appearance on stage at the age of eight, and after leaving school toured working men's clubs. After serving in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, Drake turned professional and made his television début in The Centre Show in 1953. He then joined his wartime comrade Jack Edwardes to form a double act, named 'Mick and Montmorency'. In 1954 he appeared with Bob Monkhouse in the film, Fast and Loose. \n He appeared in the television shows Laughter in Store (1957), Drake's Progress (1957–58), Charlie Drake In… (1958 to 1960) and The Charlie Drake Show (1960 to 1961), being remembered for his opening catchphrase \"Hello, my darlings!\" The catchphrase came about because he was short, and so his eyes would often be naturally directly level with a lady's bosom. Because of this and because in his television work he preferred appearing with big-busted women, the catchphrase was born. \n The later series was ended, however, by a serious accident that occurred in 1961, during a live transmission. Drake had arranged for a bookcase to be set up in such a way that it would fall apart during a slapstick sketch in which he was pulled through it. It was later discovered that an over-enthusiastic workman had \"mended\" the bookcase before the broadcast. The actors working with him, unaware of what had happened, proceeded with the rest of the sketch which required that they pick him up and throw him through an open window. Drake fractured his skull and was unconscious for three days. It was two years before he returned to the screen. \n Television fame led to four films, none of them successful — Sands of the Desert (1960), Petticoat Pirates (1961), The Cracksman (1963) and Mister Ten Per Cent (1967). He returned to television in 1963 with The Charlie Drake Show, a compilation of which won an award at the Montreux Festival in 1968. The centrepiece of this was an extended sketch featuring an orchestra performing the 1812 Overture, in which Drake appeared to play all the instruments; as well as conducting and one scene in which he was the player of a triangle waiting for his cue to play a single strike – which he subsequently missed. \n Through the series he played a gymnast doing a single arm twist from a high ring while a commentator counted eventually into the thousands and by the end of the series, Drake's arm appeared to be 20 ft long. Other shows included Who is Sylvia (1967) and Slapstick and Old Lace (1971), but it was The Worker (1965 to 1970) that gained most acclaim. \n He was the subject of This Is Your Life on two occasions, in December 1961 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews in a rehearsal room at the London Palladium, and in November 1995, when Michael Aspel surprised him at the curtain call of the comedy play Funny Money at the Playhouse Theatre. \n The Worker \n In The Worker (ATV/ITV, 1965–70) he played a perpetually unemployed labourer who, in every episode, was dispatched to a new job by the ever-frustrated clerk (firstly Mr Whitaker in series one, played by Percy Herbert, and from series two onwards Mr Pugh, played by Henry McGee) at the local labour exchange. All the jobs he embarked upon ended in disaster, sometimes with a burst of classic slapstick, sometimes with a bewildered Drake himself at the centre", "parametric_answer": "bobby darin", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

At an early but critical stage of the Northern Ireland peace process, Mr. Reynolds used his integrity, perseverance, and resilience to bring about the 1993 Downing Street Declaration with former British Prime Minister John Major. He also helped broker the 1994 Irish Republican Army (IRA) ceasefire. Without these significant milestones, subsequent agreements – and the remarkable gains of the peace process – would not have been possible. \n Today we see a different Northern Ireland, thanks in no small part to Mr. Reynolds’ work and the partnerships he forged across barriers.

For example, children born on a Monday are said to be \"fair of face,\" while those born on a Tuesday are \"full of grace,\" according to the rhyme. Over the years, the fortunes associated with each day have changed. In some earlier versions, it was Friday's child that would be \"full of woe.\" The rhyme dates back to around the 16th century.  Linda Grimes: Visiting Reality : Wednesday's Child -- say ...Linda Grimes: Visiting Reality                    : Wednesday's Child -- say what? \n Tuesday, September 21, 2010 \n Wednesday's Child -- say what? \n I was born on a Wednesday. According to a certain nursery rhyme, this makes me full of woe: \n Monday's child is fair of face, \n Tuesday's child is full of grace, \n Wednesday's child is full of woe, \n Thursday's child has far to go. \n Friday's child works hard for a living, \n Saturday's child is loving and giving, \n But a child born on the Sabbath day \n Is fair and wise and good and gay. \n Frankly, this poem has bugged the shit out of me ever since I was little girl and looked up \"woe\" in the dictionary. I mean, WTF? Just because I was born on a Wednesday, I'm doomed to \"deep distress,\" \"grief,\" and \"misery\"? Or even \"misfortune,\" \"calamity,\" and \"grievous affliction\"? \n Thanks a lot, Mother Goose. Way to make somebody feel lousy. BTW, those feathers? They make your tail look fat. How's that for some woe? Huh? How do you like it? \n It didn't help matters any that I was displaced as the baby of the family when my little brother was born...on the Sabbath day. Not only the Sabbath day, but Easter Sunday! Sheesh. How Sabbath-y can you get? \n Okay, so maybe I was a little full of woe that day. I already had two brothers, and I wanted a sister. Sue me. \n (Yes, I got over it. I love my little brother dearly. He's a gem. In fact, you might even say he's good and wise and fair. Pretty sure he's not gay, though.) \n The point is, I don't want to be full of woe! I reject woe-ness! No woe-ity for me, please. I prefer to live a woe-free life, thank you very much. \n So, to this effect, I propose a slight edit to the poem, one I will substitute in my head whenever I happen to hear or read it. I've narrowed it down to two choices: \n \"Wednesday's child is full of flow.\" (As in, serenely flowing through life.) \n Or  \"Monday's child is fair of face...,\" by Mother Goose\"Monday's child is fair of face...,\" by Mother Goose \n Monday's child is fair of face, \n Tuesday's child is full of grace; \n Wednesday's child is full of woe, \n Thursday's child has far to go; \n Friday's child is loving and giving, \n Saturday's child works hard  for its living; \n But the child that is born on the  Sabbath day \n Is bonny and blithe, and good and gay. \n    Poem:", "parametric_answer": "tuesday", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

A population of around 342,000 makes Christchurch our second largest city. \n Christchurch is a 1 hour 20 minute flight from Auckland and a ¾ hour flight from Wellington. It takes 4¾ hours driving to get to Picton for the interisland ferry. \n The other main centres of the region, Ashburton (pop. 31,000) and Timaru (43,929), are 1¼ and 2¼ hours away respectively. \n From the air the Canterbury plains form a vast patchwork of neatly laid out farms. These plains are crossed by several large rivers descending from the snow clad Southern Alps to the west of the region. As they cross the plains, the rivers divide into braids. \n The coastline features open sandy beaches, although Banks Peninsula has many smaller, sheltered bays. \n IconEconomy and industry \n Canterbury has a thriving economy, with one of the lowest rates of unemployment in the OECD. The region’s Gross Domestic Product continues to increase, largely driven by the booming construction sector. \n But construction is not the only sector performing well, other sectors to experience strong growth in the year ending March 2014 include Professional, Scientific and Technical Services, Health Care and Social Assistance, Finance and Insurance, Retail Trade, Accommodation, and Cafes and Restaurants. \n Christchurch is also New Zealand’s second largest region for technology businesses and boasts some of Australasia’s most innovative and successful software, hardware and electronics companies. These include a combination of local firms such as Jade Software, Tait Communications and SLI Systems, plus globally head-quartered multi-nationals such as Hewlett Packard, Allied Telesis and Sungard. \n Canterbury is a world-renowned food growing region, producing amongst other things, meat products, seafood, dairy food and wine for domestic consumption and export. Non-food products are also important such as seeds and forage crops. The region is also a hub for agribusiness research and agritech innovations, undertaken by the private sector and by globally-recognised research institutes such as Lincoln University, Landcare Research, Plant and Food Research and AgResearch.  \n Tourism is also an important export income earner for Christchurch. The city has traditionally been seen as the gateway for tourism in the South Island. The city’s international airport is second only to Auckland in terms of international arrivals and departures. \n IconClimate \n Summer in Christchurch is mild with daily maximum temperatures of averaging around 22.5°C. Temperatures are often moderated by sea breezes, but a record of 41.6°C was reached in February 1973. On summer days there is sometimes a hot, dry nor’west wind, and a high arch of clouds in the sky – the nor’west arch. \n In winter it is common for the temperature to fall below 0°C at night rising to around 11°C during the day. There are on average 99 days of ground frost per year. Snow falls on average three times per year. \n Many migrants have already made Canterbury home.

CC BY: Rob Young \n July 1, 2013 \n 10 things you need to know today \n Today's best articles \n The week's best photojournalism \n Daily business briefing \n Some cities have names that mean something obvious, like Portland, Little Rock, Long Beach, and Salt Lake City. If you take a moment to think about them, these names are awfully boring and plain, especially when compared to city names that seem rather exotic: Shanghai, Rio de Janeiro, Reykjavík, Tokyo… \n But plenty of these romantic-sounding names mean something in the language spoken by people who live in these cities, and sometimes what they mean is a little less charming. Here are a few good examples of city names that just don't sound as fascinating when translated. \n 1. Muddy Confluence \n This city grew up at the place where two muddy rivers flow together. That place happens to be in Malaysia, so when they named it Muddy Confluence they did so in Malay: Kuala Lumpur. \n 2. On the Sea \n This city used to be on the sea (now it's a bit inland). Specifically, it was on the sea in China. In Mandarin Chinese, the way to say On the Sea is Shanghai. \n 3. Sheltered Bay \n Yes, this city has a very nice sheltered bay. Most people who live there now speak English, but some of them still speak Hawai'ian, and the name is in Hawai'ian too: Honolulu. \n 4. Smoky Bay \n Another bay. This one isn't really smoky, it's steamy from geothermal activity. But the name originally given to it stuck — in the local language, Icelandic: Reykjavík. \n 5. Northern Capital \n Can you imagine calling the capital of your country Northern Capital? Seems kinda basic, no? And why Northern? Well, the older capital was in the south and is now called Southern Capital, though it's not a capital anymore. Who has these plain capital city names? More than a billion people — in China: the northern one is Beijing (the old transliteration is Peking) and the southern one is Nanjing (the old transliteration is Nanking). \n 6. Eastern Capital \n China isn't the only country with a really plain name for its capital. In Japan, they have Eastern Capital — or, as they call it, Tokyo. The former capital of the country is even better: Kyoto. Does that mean Capital of the East? Nope — it just means Capital City. \n 7. Peace \n OK, this is not bad for a name. But it's pretty simple. And it's another capital. The country is Bolivia, and the language they speak is Spanish — which uses a definite article (\"the\") in a name like this: La Paz. Actually, the full name is Nuestra Señora de la Paz: Our Lady of Peace. \n 8. Pass \n Paz may sound like Pass, but this city's name actually means Pass. Or, since it's in Spanish, The Pass. And in west Texas, there are plenty of Spanish speakers who know that's what they mean when they say El Paso. \n 9.

{"question": "Which British university was the first to throw open all degrees to women (in 1878)?", "answers": ["london"], "context": "University of Glasgow :: Story :: Women in the UniversityUniversity of Glasgow :: Story :: Women in the University \n Women in the University \n Not yet registered? Register Here . \n Women in the University \n Today, nearly 60 per cent of students studying at the University are women.  The number of women joining the research and academic staff in the University continues to grow and, in recent years, the University has appointed its first female Dean, Vice-Principal, and Deputy Vice-Chancellor.  Yet women have only been permitted to study at Scottish universities since 1892, and Glasgow was the scene of many significant achievements in the campaign for women's access to higher education. \n Jessie Campbell \n The movement for the higher education of women began in earnest in Britain and the United States during the 1840s, but progress was slow in Scotland.  The movement had prominent supporters in the West of Scotland, including the University Principal, John Caird, and in April 1877 they founded the Glasgow Association for the Higher Education of Women.  The Association's primary aims were to offer women courses of study similar to those available to men at universities, and \"to promote generally the higher culture and education of women\" with the co-operation of the University of Glasgow. \n The founders of the Association included some of the most influential and wealthy women in the West of Scotland, many of whom sat on its General Committee.  Principal Caird was the first Chairman; the Princess Louise, daughter of Queen Victoria and the Marchioness of Lorne, was President, and Mrs Jessie Campbell of Tulliechewan and Mrs Jane Scott were Vice-Presidents. \n Janet Galloway \n The Association offered lectures by University professors in class rooms at the University and also (from 1878) at St Andrew's Halls.  The lectures were initially in Psychology, Logic, Moral Philosophy, French literature and Astronomy, with others such as Modern Literature and Natural Philosophy added later.  Tutorials were offered in the winter, in Latin, Mathematics and the Theory of Music.  Written examinations were set in all subjects, and essays were required for some, as the Association sought to provide courses of study which replicated those for a University Arts degree.  In the first year, more than 318 women attended classes. \n In June 1883 the Association was incorporated under the Companies Act as Queen Margaret College, the first and only college in Scotland to provide higher education for women.  It was named for Margaret (d 1093), the wife of King Malcolm III and a patron of arts and literature, who was canonized in 1250, and its aim was \"to perform for women work similar to that done by colleges and universities for men.\"  The first resident secretary and superintendent was Janet Galloway , who had been an Honorary Secretary to the Association from its inception. \n Queen Margaret College \n The College was housed in North Park House on the banks of the River Kelvin, a splendid mansion which was purchased and gifted by the Glasgow philanthropist Mrs Isabella Elder .  Lecturers were appointed, many of them from the ranks of the University's teaching staff, and classes were offered on a wide range of Arts subjects.  More courses were offered in later years; for example, science laboratories were equipped in 1888 for teaching subjects such as Chemistry and Physics. \n Isabella Elder \n In response to growing demand from women for access to medical education, a medical school was established within the College in 1890 with laboratories, a dissecting room and all the facilities that would be required for teaching.  Mrs Elder agreed to meet the initial running costs of the school and Glasgow Royal Infirmary set aside beds for the clinical instruction of female medical students.  The women were able to study for licences to practice medicine from the Triple Qualification Board of the Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons in Scotland and the Universities of London and Dublin. \n In February 1892 the Scottish Universities Commissioners published an Ordinance authorising the universities to make provision for the instruction and graduation of women.

Here are 9 surprising facts about the series. \n 1. John Sullivan would go on to become a sure-fire comedy hitmaker for the BBC, but in the 1970s he was working as a scene shifter for the BBC. \n He had to pester Dennis Wilson at look at the script he’d written for the show, which he wrote in reaction to what he considered the stale sitcoms on air at the time. \n 2. BBC Head of Comedy John Howard Davies said that the show was the first script he had ever read which was ready to start filming straight away. \n 3. Playing a left wing revolutionary wasn’t a huge jump for Lindsay, who has working-class northern roots and a staunch trade unionist father. \n 4. In a move that Wolfie Smith would have been proud of, Lindsay once declined the offer of dinner with Margaret Thatcher after she saw him perform as Henry II in the theatre \n “There was a knock and there was Mrs Thatcher, as she was then, asking why I’d turned her down,\" revealed Lindsay. \n “I said it was because of her politics and she said: ‘Well, that doesn’t affect your appetite, does it?’ I said it did, but I was terribly intimidated.” \n 5.

Meldrew is a foil for the bothersome aspects of children, cars, animals, power cuts and next-door neighbours (his particular example being Patrick Trench, played by Angus Deayton). The character was created specifically for Wilson, with whom Renwick had worked on the series Hot Metal, though Wilson initially turned the part down as at 53, he felt he was too young to play the 60-year-old Meldrew. Renwick considered Les Dawson for the part before Wilson changed his mind.  \n __TOC__ \n Character  \n In the first episode, the cantankerous Meldrew, aged 60, is forced into retirement as a security guard (which he describes as \"being replaced by a box\"). The series follows Meldrew as he tries to fill his new-found leisure with odd jobs and unusual idiosyncrasies, or to get a new job. However, he regularly finds himself mistreated, misunderstood or simply the victim of bad luck, which leads to his complaining heartily. \n The pensioner is most famous for his catchphrase, \"I don't believe it!!\", an expression of discontent which was actually used fairly infrequently. Quite often, he stops short at \"I don't ...\". According to Wilson, this is because series creator Renwick wanted to avoid overusing it.. Other frequently used expressions of exasperation are \"Unbe-lieeeve-able!\", \"What in the name of bloody hell?!\" and \"In the name of sanity!\" Victor is something of a hypochondriac, keeping a medical book with him to look up every ailment he believes has befallen him. (Margaret describes it as \"browsing through to see what he can die of next\".) \n The series was so successful that in the UK the term a Victor Meldrew has become a euphemism for a bitter and complaining elderly man. However, both Renwick and Wilson himself have disagreed that Victor is an example of this stereotype; Wilson himself once said in an interview that he was a \"normal man in a world full of idiots\", and he is shown to be more of a tragicomedy character, not bitter and grumpy by nature, but driven to it due to his habit of attracting trouble. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name \"Victor\" is ironic, since he almost always ends up as the loser.  \n Although he is seen as misanthropic by the many victims of his wrath and misfortune, Victor is often depicted as an honest, likeable and sympathetic character. Ultimately, many felt that the things that he railed against, e.g. yobbish behaviour, lack of consideration for others, shoddy service, and bureaucratic indifference, were things that he had every right to get angry about. In fact, if anything, most admired him for having the guts to stand up and be counted, as the bizarre misfortunes that befell Meldrew would be enough to exasperate anyone. In the episode \"Warm Champagne\", his long-suffering wife Margaret defends him. When Margaret contemplates having an affair with Ben, a man she meets on holiday, Ben puts Victor down and accuses him of being insensitive. Margaret replies that Victor is in fact the most sensitive person she's ever met. If he weren't so sensitive, he wouldn't be upset by the smallest of things, and that is the reason she loves him (and \"continually wants to ram his head through a television screen\"). In \"Descent into the Maelstrom\", Margaret is visited by a woman she used to care for as a child, but Victor discovered that she was in fact mentally unstable, sought by the police for kidnapping a toddler, and had stolen a pair of earrings Margaret treasured. Victor turned the woman over to the authorities and chose not to tell Margaret, preferring to let her think he had lost the earrings, knowing how much the truth would upset her.

There were some painful, emotional, hilarious and simply classic moments based in the Nags Head pub in Peckham and it’s those moments which I intend on re-living throughout this article. \n One of the all-time greatest moments based in the Nags Head Pub, has to be Rodney and Cassandra’s wedding reception held in the hall above the bar, this was arguably the greatest pub moment of all time, but what made it so special? \n For me and I’m sure many others, it’s got to be towards the end of that certain scene where Rodney and Cassandra are about to leave to go on their honeymoon after just getting married. You can see Del and Rodders both pause for a few seconds and are looking directly at one another from opposite ends of the room, as this is the start of Rodney’s new life. After a short pause we see Rodney turns his back and leaves the room, you have Del, standing in the centre of the hall with a beautiful song being played in background. Throughout this wonderful scene the audience (although silent) played a huge role in making this moment so memorable. \n Why? Because normally Only Fools’ doesn’t contain scenes which are classed as emotional because it’s just so funny, however this scene was the complete opposite, not funny, just so perfectly emotional. \n Did you know; at the time of filming, the audience weren’t laughing and Tony Dow (the director at the time) said to John Sullivan ; “the audience aren’t laughing?” the response from John was spot on; “Tony, they aren’t laughing, because their crying”… and out came the tissues. \n Lovely Jubbly in’it! \n At first, this was schedule to", "parametric_answer": "denzil", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

Vegetables have been heavily cultivated by humans, and the vegetables eaten in modern times differ greatly from their predecessors. Ancient man also ate plants that modern man would not usually consider vegetables, like ferns and cattails. \n Full Answer \n Slate reports that kale, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts and kohlrabi were all cultivated from the same prehistoric plant between 8,000 and 10,000 years ago. \"Wild carrots may predate human agriculture, but they’re unpalatable and look nothing like the cultivated variety.\" The orange carrot known in modern times did not exist until the 17th century. \n In contrast, many modern fruits have ancient counterparts. Olives, plums and pears were found in northern Israel from the Paleolithic era. Dates were found in the teeth of a 40,000-year-old Neanderthal. Grapes were found in northeastern Tennessee that appear to be 7 million years old. According to Slate, \"Apple trees blanketed Kazakhstan 30,000 years ago, oranges were common in China, and wild berries grew in Europe.\" The fruit available has evolved less drastically than vegetables, but has still been modified somewhat. \"Selection by humans has made them larger and sweeter, and may have caused other chemical changes.\"  Tollund ManTollund Man is a naturally mummified corpse of a man who lived during the 4th century BC, during the period characterised in Scandinavia as the Pre-Roman Iron Age.  He was found in 1950 on the Jutland Peninsula in Denmark, buried in a peat bog which preserved his body. Such a find is known as a bog body.  The man's physical features were so well-preserved that he was mistaken at the time of discovery for a recent murder victim. Twelve years before Tollund Man's discovery, another bog body, Elling Woman, had been discovered in the same bog.  Ancient bog bodies have been found in England and Ireland as well. \n Discovery \n On 6 May 1950,  brothers Viggo and Emil Højgaard from the small village of Tollund were cutting peat in the Bjældskovdal peat bog, 12 km west of Silkeborg, Denmark.  As they worked one of their wives, who was helping to load the peat on a carriage, noticed a corpse in the peat layer. It appeared so fresh that the workers believed they had discovered a recent murder victim. After much deliberation, the woman notified the police in Silkeborg. The find was reported to the police on Tuesday 8 May 1950. They were baffled by the condition of the body and, in an attempt to identify the time of death, they brought in archaeology professor P. V. Glob.  Upon initial examination, Glob suggested that the body was over 2,000 years old and most likely the victim of a ritual sacrifice. \n The Tollund Man lay 50 m away from firm ground, buried under approximately 2 m of peat, his body arranged in a foetal position. He wore a pointed skin cap made of sheepskin and wool, fastened securely under his chin by a hide thong. There was a smooth hide belt around his waist. Additionally, the corpse had a noose made of plaited animal hide drawn tight around the neck and trailing down his back. Other than these, the body was naked. His hair was cropped so short as to be almost entirely hidden by his cap. There was short stubble (1 mm length) on his chin and upper lip, suggesting that he had not shaved on the day of his death.  \n Scholars believe the man was a human sacrifice rather than executed criminal because of the arranged position of his body, and the fact that his eyes and mouth were closed.Hart, Edward, dir. \"Ghosts of Murdered Kings\".

Wampum was also given to seal a promise. \n The colonists used wampum as money. But then, they used everything as money, including coins from many different European nations, all at the same time.

{"question": "What is the most popular hobby", "answers": ["stamp collecting"], "context": "HobbyA hobby is a regular activity that is done for enjoyment, typically during one's leisure time. Hobbies can include collecting themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements. A list of hobbies is lengthy and always changing as interests and fashions change. By continually participating in a particular hobby, one can acquire substantial skill and knowledge in that area. Engagement in hobbies has increased since the late nineteenth century as workers have more leisure time and advancing production and technology have provided more support for leisure activities. As some hobbies have become less popular, like stamp collecting, others have been created following technological advances, like video games. \n Hobbyists are a part of a wider group of people engaged in leisure  pursuits where the boundaries of each group overlap to some extent. The Serious Leisure Perspective  groups hobbyists with amateurs and volunteers and identifies three broad groups of leisure activity with hobbies being found mainly in the Serious leisure category. \n a. Casual leisure is intrinsically rewarding, short-lived, pleasurable activity requiring little or no preparation \n b. Serious leisure is the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer that is substantial, rewarding and results in a sense of accomplishment. \n c. Project-based leisure is a short-term often a one-off project that is rewarding.  \n Etymology  \n In the 16th century, the term \"hobyn\" had the meaning of \"small horse or pony\". The term \"hobby horse\" was documented in a 1557 payment confirmation for a \"Hobbyhorse\" from Reading, England.  The item, originally called a \"Tourney Horse\", was made of a wooden or basketwork frame with an artificial tail and head. It was designed for a child to mimic riding a real horse. By 1816 the derivative, \"hobby\", was introduced into the vocabulary of a number of English people.  Over the course of subsequent centuries, the term came to be associated with recreation and leisure.  In the 17th century, the term was used in a pejorative sense by suggesting that a hobby was a childish pursuit, however in the 18th century with a more industrial society and more leisure time, hobbies took on greater respectability  A hobby is also called a pastime, derived from the use of hobbies to pass the time. A hobby became an activity that is practised regularly and usually with some worthwhile purpose.  Hobbies are usually, but not always, practised primarily for interest and enjoyment, rather than financial reward. \n History \n The origins of the word hobby suggest that initially it was the word given to pursuits that others thought somewhat childish or trivial. However as early as 1676 Sir Matthew Hale, in  Contemplations Moral and Divine, wrote \"Almost every person hath some hobby horse or other wherein he prides himself.\"  He was acknowledging that a \"hobby horse\" produces a legitimate sense of pride. By the mid 18th century there was a flourishing of hobbies as working people had more regular hours of work and greater leisure time. They more time to pursue interests that brought them satisfaction.  However, there was concern that these working people might not use their leisure time in worthwhile pursuits. \"The hope of weaning people away from bad habits by the provision of counter-attractions came to the fore in the 1830s, and has rarely waned since. Initially the bad habits were perceived to be of a sensual and physical nature, and the counter attractions, or perhaps more accurately alternatives, deliberately cultivated rationality and the intellect.\"  The flourishing book and magazine trade of the day encouraged worthwhile hobbies and pursuits. The burgeoning manufacturing trade made materials used in hobbies cheap and was responsive to the changing interests of hobbyists. \n The English have been identified as enthusiastic hobbyists, as George Orwell observed. \"[A]nother English characteristic which is so much a part of us that we barely notice it … is the addiction to hobbies and spare-time occupations, the privateness of English life. We are a nation of flower-lovers, but also a nation of stamp-collectors, pigeon-fanciers, amateur carpenters, coupon-", "parametric_answer": "watching tv", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

First, of course, is the hero's birth and career, and although these might have survived in a somewhat legendary form during the seventy years that have elapsed since his death, they could in themselves only have been expected to live among the Cumberland fells and dales where he hunted his pack 1 . \n The next link in the chain is the stirring song that carried his name everywhere, and the strains of which - from the forests and fertile cornlands of the Far West to the arid plains of India, and from remote Cumbrian valleys to the lonely Tasmanian hills where, after his life's fitful fever, its erratic author sleeps - are probably never silent. Even that song would have had but a sporadic existence had it not been for the fortuitous incident of its being sung on a long-forgotten festive occasion in Carlisle 2 ; for the late Sir Wilfrid Lawson in his \"Reminiscences,\" edited by the late Right Hon. George W. E. Russell, remarks: \n What seemed to me rather strange was that the old Cumberland Song, \"D'ye ken John Peel\" was not particularly widely known for many years after John Peel died in 1854, but suddenly burst into popular favour and became fashionable in London dancing rooms and in most places of joviality and festivity. \n   \n And further, a fillip was given to that send-off by the literary finish which the song received from the hand of one to whom the ballad and dialect lore of Cumberland must for ever be indebted. \n To these links has been added another in a striking portrait of John Peel, by Mr. Joseph Simpson, R.B.A., a reproduction of which appears as a frontispiece to this volume. \n \"Did John Feel ever exist, or is he a mythical huntgod, even as Tom Bowling is an enshrinement of the perfection of a British tar?\" That is a question which perennially crops up in newspapers, and which finds its answer in the registers of Caldbeck Parish Church, where he was baptised and married, and in whose sequestered graveyard he now rests. \n John Peel, then, was the son of William Peel, a small \"statesman\" or yeoman, and his wife, Lettice, whose maiden name was Scott. He was born at Greenrigg, a little hamlet in High Caldbeck township; the exact date of his birth being unknown. From the inscription on his tombstone it would seem to have been in 1776, and although the date of his baptism is given in the parish register as 24th September, 1777 that would not contradict the earlier date for his birth; because in those days, and later, it was not at all unusual for bairns to ga' to church i' their clogs to be christened, sometimes two or three of a family at the same time. \n In his marriage Peel was as impetuous as in his horsemanship; for having at the age of twenty fallen in love with Mary White, the eighteen-year-old daughter of a neighbouring yeoman at Uldale, he put up the banns in Caldbeck Church; and, when the would-be bride's mother interrupted their dream of bliss by exclaiming, \"I forbid the banns. They're far ower young,\" he borrowed his father's fleetest steed, \"Binsey,\" received Mary from her window at midnight, and bore her off in triumph to Gretna Green. This marriage received the Church's blessing at Caldbeck on 18th December, 1797, and is duly recorded in the parish register there. \n His wife inherited from her father a small property at Ruthwaite, near Ireby, and there Peel resided from 1823, until his death on 13th November, 1854. He was buried in Caldbeck Churchyard; and eleven of the thirteen children - six sons and seven daughters - who wore born to them followed him to his grave.

Each of these badges (Artist,   Athlete, Citizen, Cook, First Aid, Girl Scout Way, and Naturalist) is   available at five levels of Girl Scouting, from Brownie to Ambassador. \n Ceremonies \n Here are a few other popular traditions for Girl Scouts to enjoy. \n Ceremonies honoring Founder's Day, which is celebrated on  Juliette     Gordon Low 's birthday, are another valued Girl Scout tradition.   They highlight the important role Juliette played in the development   of the Girl Scout movement in the United States. Learn more     about  other     Girl Scout ceremonies . \n Girl Scout Sign: Girl Scouts make the Girl Scout sign—raising     three fingers of the right hand with the thumb holding down the     pinky—when they say the Girl Scout Promise. The three fingers     represent the three parts of the Promise. \n Motto: The Girl Scout motto is \"Be prepared.\" In     the 1947 Girl Scout Handbook, the motto was explained this     way: \"A Girl Scout is ready to help out wherever she is needed.     Willingness to serve is not enough; you must know how to do the job     well, even in an emergency.\" The same holds true today. \n Slogan: The Girl Scout slogan, which has been used since     1912, is \"Do a good turn daily.\" The slogan is a reminder     of the many ways girls can contribute positively to the lives of   others. \n Greeting: Girl Scouts can greet one another with the Girl     Scout handshake, used by Girl Scouts and Girl Guides all over the     world. The handshake is made by shaking hands with the left hand and     making the Girl Scout sign with the right. The left hand is nearest     to the heart and signifies friendship. \n Friendship Circle: Representing the unbroken chain of     friendship among Girl Scouts and Girl Guides around the world, the     Friendship Circle involves Girl Scouts standing in a circle,     crossing their right arms over their left, and clasping hands with     their friends on both sides. Everyone then makes a silent wish as     a friendship squeeze is passed from hand to hand around the   circle. \n SWAPS: Girl Scouts often make small tokens of friendship to     exchange with the Girl Scouts they meet while traveling. These     little gifts are called ”SWAPS,” which stands for “Special     Whatchamacallits Affectionately Pinned Somewhere.” \n Learn more about Girl Scout traditions and their history     in  The Girl's Guide to Girl   Scouting .

{"question": "Who were Bolton Wanderers opponents in the first Wembley F.A. Cup Final", "answers": ["west ham united"], "context": "Bolton Wanderers F.C.Bolton Wanderers Football Club is a professional association football club based in Bolton, Greater Manchester. For the 2016–17 Season, the team will play in League One, the third tier of the English football league system. \n The club was formed as Christ Church Football Club in 1874, and adopted its current name in 1877. Founder members of the Football League in 1888, Bolton have spent the highest number of seasons of any club in the top flight without winning the title (the 2011–12 season was their 73rd, non-consecutive year in the top flight).  The closest they have come to the title is third in the First Division on three occasions (1891–92, 1920–21 and 1924–25). As of 2015, the club has spent more seasons in the top division than any other club outside the current Premier League. \n Bolton were a successful cup side in the 1920s, winning the FA Cup three times. The club won the cup a fourth time in 1958. A leaner spell followed, reaching a nadir in 1987 when the club spent a season in the Fourth Division. The club regained top-flight status in 1995 after a 15-year absence. In a period of relative success, the club qualified for the UEFA Cup twice, reaching the last 32 in 2005–06 and the last 16 in 2007–08. \n The club played at Burnden Park for 102 years from 1895.  On 9 March 1946, The Burnden Park disaster occurred, which was a  human crush in which 33 Bolton fans lost their lives.   In 1997 it moved out of town to the Reebok Stadium, named after long-term club sponsor Reebok. The stadium was renamed the Macron Stadium in July 2014, to reflect the club's new deal with Italian sportswear company Macron. \n History \n Early history (1877–1929) \n The club was founded by the Reverend Joseph Farrall Wright, Perpetual curate of Christ Church Bolton  and Thomas Ogden, the schoolmaster at the adjacent church school in 1874 as Christ Church F.C.  It was initially run from the church of the same name on Deane Road, Bolton, on the site where the Innovation factory of the University of Bolton now stands. The club left the location following a dispute with the vicar, and changed its name to Bolton Wanderers in 1877. The name was chosen as the club initially had a lot of difficulty finding a permanent ground to play on, having used three venues in its first four years of existence.  \n Bolton were one of the 12 founder members of the Football League, which formed in 1888.  At the time Lancashire was one of the strongest footballing regions in the country, with 6 of the 12 founder clubs coming from within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire. Having remained in the Football League since its formation, Bolton have spent more time in the top flight (Premier League/old First Division) than out of it. \n  In 1894 Bolton reached the final of the FA Cup for the first time, but lost 4–1 to Notts County at Goodison Park.  A decade later they were runners-up a second time, losing 1–0 to local rivals Manchester City at Crystal Palace on 23 April 1904.  \n The period before and after the First World War was Bolton's most consistent period of top-flight success as measured by league finishes, with the club finishing outside the top 8 of the First Division on only two occasions between 1911–12 and 1927–28.  In this period Bolton equalled their record finish of third twice, in 1920–21 and 1924–25, on the latter occasion missing out on the title by just 3 points (in an era of 2 points for a win).  \n On 28 April 1923, Bolton won their first major trophy in their third final, beating West Ham United 2–0 in the first ever Wembley FA Cup final. The match, famously known as The White Horse Final was played in front of over 127,000 supporters. Bolton's centre-forward, David Jack scored the first ever goal at Wembley Stadium.

Both presenters have since moved on to other positions within BBC News and the BBC itself. Jeremy Paxman , who went on to present Newsnight in 1989, was relief newsreader from 10 September.

The bulletin design was in use from 1984–1993. \n In 1988, the Six O'Clock News studio was famously invaded during a live broadcast by a female group protesting against Britain's Section 28 (a law against the promotion of homosexuality in schools). Witchell famously grappled with the protesters and is said to have sat on one woman, provoking the memorable front-page headline in the Daily Mirror , Beeb man sits on lesbian.

Both Edwards and Bruce left the Six O'Clock News on 19 January 2003. \n On 20 January 2003, as George Alagiah and Sophie Raworth took over, the bulletin was relaunched along with the rest of BBC One's news bulletins. During Raworth's first maternity leave in 2004, Sian Williams stood in for her for over the six months. However, during Raworth's second maternity leave at the end of 2005, Natasha Kaplinsky stood in, originally as a temporary measure. As part of a presenter reshuffle in April 2006, Kaplinsky was confirmed as the new full-time presenter. Sophie Raworth was later named as the main presenter of the BBC News at One . Raworth is now a regular presenter on the News at Six and BBC News at Ten, covering for main presenters during their absences. \n Since April 2005, the programme has formed the first half-hour of the Six O'Clock Newshour on the BBC News Channel. The subsequent half-hour consists of business and sport updates presented from within the News channel studio by one of the News Channel presenters. As before, the bulletin still completes at 18:30 before splitting off to regional news programmes on BBC One . \n On 5 October 2007 it was announced that Natasha Kaplinsky was leaving the BBC to replace Kirsty Young on Five News , taking up her new role on 18 February 2008 presenting two half-hour evening bulletins. She left at the end of the Six O'Clock News on the same day.

{"question": "The country name for which bird is the 'rud' or ruddock", "answers": ["robin"], "context": "South Wiltshire Local Group - The Royal Society for the ...South Wiltshire Local Group - The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds \n South Wiltshire Local Group \n The Ruddock, RSPB Images \n New Website Feature! Birds in myth and folklore - The Robin \n The original Anglo-Saxon name for the robin was the ruddock, which alludes to its red breast. It then became the redbreast, a term used up until the last century. Its engaging demeanour led to the more familiar sobriquet of robin redbreast but in the fullness of time the term redbreast was dropped. \n In the 1500s it was also known as the robinet. The old Welsh name for the bird was bron goch which translates as 'almost red', and today it is known there as robin goch. The second part of its Latin name, Erithacus rubecula, comes from the word 'ruber' meaning ruddy. \n Its confiding nature and beautiful song has generated a wealth of folklore and it's been celebrated in verse down the ages. Robins are frequently seen on Christmas cards and this dates back to Victorian times when the first postmen were nicknamed robin redbreasts because of their red uniforms. The nickname vanished but not before the association led to robins appearing on Christmas cards and indeed Valentine cards. \n In the Celtic Yule Festival, the robin was regarded as the symbol of the New Year whilst the wren was associated with the old year. This pagan association may well be behind the old country custom of hunting the wren on Boxing Day. Whilst it was thought lucky if a robin entered your home in the New Year, at other times it was thought to foretell disaster including death, or destruction of your house by lightning or fire. \n It was also thought that bad luck would come to anyone who caught or killed a robin. As one old country rhyme says, 'if you go and catch a robin, mind you don't come back a-sobbin'. Another legend claims that the robin got his red breast when trying to pull the out the nails when Christ was on the cross. Robins are also thought to predict the weather, as another old country rhyme claims: If the robin sings in the bush, Then the weather will be coarse, But if the robin sings on the barn, Then the weather will be warm. \n So remember that when you watch your garden robins this winter! \n By Mark Barrett, our very own South Wilts \"Professor\" \n References:  Heraclitean Fire » Birding the dictionaryHeraclitean Fire » Birding the dictionary \n Birding the dictionary \n I was watching a dunnock in the garden earlier \n and it suddenly occured to me that there might be a parallel between the word ‘dunnock’ and ‘ruddock’ – the old name for a robin. \n And having got that far, I thought maybe ‘dunnock’ derived from ‘dun cock’ and ‘ruddock’ from ‘ruddy cock’. So I got out the dictionary. Turns out I was part right. \n dunnock (‘dʌnək). [app. f. dun a. + -ock dim. suffix; from the dusky brown colour of the plumage. Cf. dunlin.] \n In other words, ‘dunnock’ pretty much translates as that classic birder’s term, LBJ — Little Brown Job [btw, while I was looking for dunnock photos on Flickr, I discovered that the Dutch for dunnock is ‘heggemus’ — presumably ‘hedge mouse’. But let’s stick to one language at a time]. \n The reference to ‘dunlin’ intrigued me. \n And at dunlin I learnt that it’s f. dun a. + -ling. ‘ling’ is a  familiar diminutive suffix of course; ‘darling’ and ‘duckling’ are the most obvious examples. But there’s another small sandpiper called a sanderling, and I was curious how that fitted in. \n Well, pleasingly,  the OED’s best guess for the origin of sanderling is the Old English sand-yrðling; i.e. ‘sand-earthling’. Not as in ‘take me to your leader’; ‘earthling’ meant ‘ploughman’. Ploughman of the sand. \n Getting back", "parametric_answer": "coot", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

{"question": "In game of Trivial Pursuit: what category is coloured green", "answers": ["science and nature"], "context": "Trivial PursuitTrivial Pursuit is a board game in which winning is determined by a player's ability to answer general knowledge and popular culture questions. The game was created in December 1979 in Montreal, Quebec, by Canadian Chris Haney, a photo editor for Montreal's The Gazette, and Scott Abbott, a sports editor for The Canadian Press. After finding pieces of their Scrabble game missing, they decided to create their own game.  With the help of John Haney and Ed Werner, they completed development of the game, which was released in 1982.  \n In North America, the game's popularity peaked in 1984, a year in which over 20 million games were sold. The rights to the game were initially licensed to Selchow and Righter in 1982, then to Parker Brothers (now part of Hasbro) in 1988, after initially being turned down by the Virgin Group; in 2008 Hasbro bought the full rights, for US$80 million.  , nearly 88 million games had been sold in 26 countries and 17 languages. Northern Plastics of Elroy, Wisconsin produced 30,000,000 games between 1983 and 1985. In December 1993, Trivial Pursuit was named to the \"Games Hall of Fame\" by Games magazine. An online version of Trivial Pursuit was launched in September 2003. \n Dozens of question sets have been released for the game. The question cards are organized into themes; for instance, in the standard Genus question set, questions in green deal with science and nature. Some question sets have been designed for younger players, and others for a specific time period or as promotional tie-ins (such as Star Wars, Saturday Night Live, and The Lord of the Rings movies). \n Gameplay \n The object of the game is to move around the board by correctly answering trivia questions. Questions are split into six categories, with each one having its own color to readily identify itself; in the classic version of Trivial Pursuit, these are Geography (blue), Entertainment (pink), History (yellow), Arts & Literature (originally brown, later purple), Science & Nature (green), and Sports & Leisure (orange). The game includes a board, playing pieces, question cards, a box, small plastic wedges to fit into the playing pieces, and a die. \n Playing pieces used in Trivial Pursuit are round and divided into six sections, similar to a pie. A small plastic wedge, sometimes called cheese,  can be placed into each of these sections to mark each player's progress. \n During the game, players move their playing pieces around a track which is shaped like a wheel with six spokes. This track is divided into spaces of different colors, and the center of the board is a hexagonal \"hub\" space. At the end of each spoke is a \"category headquarters\" space. When a player's counter lands on a square, the player answers a question according to the color of the square, which corresponds to one of the six categories. If the player answers the question correctly, their turn continues; if the player's piece was on one of the category headquarters spaces, he/she collect a wedge of the same color, which fits into the playing piece. Some spaces say \"roll again,\" giving an extra roll of the die to the player. The hub is a \"wild\" space; a player landing here may answer a question in the category of his/her choice. Any number of playing pieces may occupy the same space at the same time. A variant rule ends a player's turn on collecting a wedge, preventing a single knowledgeable player from running the board. \n Once a player has collected one wedge of each color and filled up his/her playing piece, he or she must return to the hub and answer a question in a category selected by the other players. If this question is answered correctly, that player wins the game. Otherwise, the player must leave the center of the board and try again on the next turn. \n Editions \n Over the years, numerous editions of Trivial Pursuit have been produced, usually", "parametric_answer": "science", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

He was the first member of his profession to be elevated to a life peerage. \n Laurence Olivier in the title role of the film adaptation of Hamlet (1948). \n © Archive Photos \n The son of an Anglican minister, Olivier attended All Saints Choir School, where at age nine he made his theatrical debut as Brutus in an abridgement of Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar. Five years later he played the female lead in The Taming of the Shrew at Oxford’s St. Edward’s School, repeating this performance at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival. These early stage appearances did not go unnoticed by the theatrical notables of the era, who encouraged Olivier to consider acting as a profession. At first he dismissed the notion, hoping to follow the example of his older brother by managing an Indian rubber plantation; but his father, who had heretofore been ambivalent on the subject of acting, all but demanded that young Laurence embark upon a stage career. \n Olivier enrolled at the Central School of Dramatic Art in 1924, then began his professional career with the Birmingham Repertory Theatre Company (1926–28). Three years later he made his first significant West End appearance, playing the title role in a staging of P.C. Wren’s Beau Geste. Also in 1929, he made his Broadway debut in Murder on the Second Floor. Having acted in British films from 1930, he was briefly signed by Hollywood’s RKO Radio Pictures in 1931, but he failed to make much of an impression at this early date. What could have been his first Hollywood break in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer’s Queen Christina (1933) was scuttled when star Greta Garbo vetoed Olivier as her leading man in favour of her former lover John Gilbert . \n Laurence Olivier with his first wife, Jill Esmond, arriving in New York City, 1933. \n Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. \n During this period Olivier broadened his acting range by tackling difficult classical roles; he also chose to accept character parts that allowed him to hide what he considered his shortcomings behind heavy makeup and false beards. As he gained confidence in himself and his craft, audiences responded positively to him. The theatre critics also liked his work, though their comments were guarded and often compared Olivier unfavourably to such contemporaries as John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson . He scored a significant triumph as star of an unabridged 1937 staging of Hamlet. He returned to Hollywood to play the tormented Heathcliff in Samuel Goldwyn ’s production of Wuthering Heights (1939).

That makes it 3 times the height of Mt. Everest. Unlike Everest, Olympus Mons has a very gentle slope. It is up to 550 km at its base. The edge of the volcano’s base is marked by a basal cliff that is 6 km high in some places, but has been eradicated by the overflow of lava in the Martian past. \n Olympus Mons is the result of many thousands of  basaltic lava flows. The extraordinary size of the volcano has been attributed to the lack of tectonic plate movement on the planet. The lack of movement allows the Martian crust to remain fixed in place over a magma hotspot allowing repeated, large lava flows. Many of these flows have levees along their edges. The cooler, outer margins of the flow solidify, forming the levees and leaving a central trough of molten, flowing lava. In images of the volcano you can see partially collapsed lava tubes seen as chains of pit craters. Broad lava fans formed by lava emerging from intact, subsurface tubes are easily visible as well. Some areas along the volcano’s base show lava flows spilling out into the surrounding plains, forming broad aprons, which are burying the basal escarpment. Crater counts taken by the high resolution images returned by the Mars Express spacecraft in 2004 seem to show that flows on the northwestern flank range in age from 2 million years old to 115 million years old. Since these flows are geologically young, it may indicate that the volcano is still active. \n The Olympus Mons caldera complex is made up of at least six overlapping calderas and segments of caldera. Each caldera formed when the roof collapsed following depletion and retreat of the subsurface magma chamber, so each caldera represents a separate eruption. A ‘lake of lava’ seems to have formed the the largest and oldest caldera segment. Using geometric relationships based on caldera dimensions, scientists estimate that the magma chamber associated with this caldera lies about 32 km below the floor of the caldera. Crater size/frequency distributions indicate the calderas range in age from 350 million years ago to about 150 million years ago and may have all formed within 100 million years of each other. \n As the largest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons has been extensively studied. Those studies have been helped by the closeness of Mars. Those studies will continue into the future as will the exploration of the entire planet. \n We’ve had many stories about Olympus Mons on Universe Today. Here’s an article about landslides on the side of Olympus Mons , and anther about how Olympus Mons might have been active recently . \n Here’s a website all about Olympus Mons, and more information from Exploring Mars. \n We have recorded a whole series of podcasts about the Solar System at Astronomy Cast .

A weekly half hour show introduced by Valentine Dyall,  Old Harrovian actor who had made his radio debut in 1936, as The Man In Black, a sinister character who has been recently described by Edward de Souza as \"a sort of darker Somerset Maughham, a creepy raconteur who picks up news of the spooky bits of life\". He introduced the story, made comments afterwards and sometimes provided short narrative links. \n Many of the plays were originally written for American radio by John Dickson Carr, but the series also dramatised stories by such authors as Edgar Allan Poe, Robert Louis Stevenson and W. W. Jacobs. \n Appointment With Fear ran for a total of ten series between 1943 and 1955, with Valentine Dyall introducing nine of them. He was unavailable for the second series, and was replaced by his Father, Franklin Dyall. \n In 1949 The Man In Black was awarded a series of his own, called The Man In Black, with a very similar format to Appointment With Fear. \n The man came out of retirement in 1988 for a series of twelve shows under the title Fear on Four. Valentine Dyall had died in 1985, aged 77, so his role was taken over by Edward de Souza. The programme returned for a second series in January 1989, a third series in December 1990 and a fourth series in December 1992. \n Unfortunately very few shows of Appointment With Fear have survived. Only four shows are known to exist, namely 1/2, 3/1, 3/6 and 6/4. No shows from The Man In Black series have survived.

Appointment With Fear ran for a total of ten series. Valentine hosted nine of them except the second one (perhaps due to the war?). He was replaced during that series by his father, Franklin Dyall * . \n Appointment With Fear ran     sporadically   from 1943 to 1949 (plus a revival in 1955). Sometime in 1949, the series was renamed The Man In Black, and had a very similar format to Appointment With Fear. ( Britishdrama.org ) \n Dyall starred in various movies in the 1940s and 1960s. He also played the Black Guardian in TV's Dr. Who in the early 1980s. He  continued to work in radio, and played in many Halloween broadcasts of the '70s and '80s, sometimes nostalgically recreating \"The Man in Black.\" In 1988, a series of twelve radio shows under the title Fear on Four recreated Dyall's character, but it was voiced by Edward de Souza.

{"question": "Which musical instrument was patented in Berlin by Freidrich Buschmann in 1822", "answers": ["accordions", "accordion", "akkordeon"], "context": "Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann - Accordion-WikiChristian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann - Accordion-Wiki \n Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann \n Jump to: navigation , search \n Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann (17 June 1805 –1 October 1864) was a German musical instrument maker, often credited with inventing the harmonica and sometimes the accordion . \n Contents \n Biography \n Thuringia \n Buschmann was born in Friedrichroda, Thuringia. His father, Johann Buschmann, was a pipe organ builder, who in 1816 developed the terpodion , a friction instrument played either with wooden hammers or sometimes with a piano-like keyboard, based on the same principle as the glass harmonica . From 1819 Johann took Friedrich with him on his frequent journeys. \n Berlin \n In the first half of 1821 Johann Buschmann travelled to London, accompanied by his son Friedrich, and agreed a £1,000 contract with a Mr. Löschmann besides taking other orders for terpodions. On their return the Buschmanns set up a workshop in Berlin, where Friedrich, aged 16, was already skilled and experienced enough at musical instrument construction to begin building terpodions on the basis of written instructions from his father. \n Altogether, 25 terpodions were built, most of them by Friedrich. His brother Eduard worked mainly on the wooden cases and inlays, and was in charge of the appearance of the instruments, though the brothers lived and worked in different German cities. Nearly all the terpodions ever built are still in existence in different European museums. \n Johann and Eduard meanwhile continued their advertising journeys throughout Europe. Besides their performances, they had to service the instruments they had already sold, as they did not function very reliably over a longer period. This may well have been a principal reason why Friedrich was looking for other methods of reliable sound generation for tuning purposes. It is certain that they must have become aware of all kinds of modern developments in this area as they travelled through different countries, which contributed to Friedrich's further refinement of the physharmonica . \n In Berlin in 1828 Friedrich built an instrument, originally intended only for use as a tuning aid, which at first consisted of 21 different metal free reeds fastened to a wooden block in such a way that it was possible to blow the reeds individually. He then experimented further by fastening the reeds inside a small box \"4 inches square and equally high\"  Letter to his uncle dated 28 December 1828  (in other words a cubic box with 4\" sides), each of which could be made to vibrate by blowing through 21 individual \"tone chambers\" (Tonlochkanzellen). This instrument he named an aeoline . \n The earliest experiments with the aeoline may have taken place in 1824, when it has been claimed that Buschmann built a tuning aid named an aura, about 4 inches long and equipped with 15 reed tongues. (The name Aura was also then in use in German to mean a Jew's harp ). \n In Buschmann's letters to his uncle, brother, and father it appears that he built a bigger version of an aeoline in 1829, with bellows and piano keyboard, which, being about the size of a small writing desk, was still much smaller than any comparable fixed key instrument they had built previously. \n The Buschmanns certainly knew of an instrument built at about this time by Johann Caspar Schlimbach , an instrument maker trained in Vienna, and his cousin Bernhard Eschenbach in Königshofen in Bavaria: this was a pianoforte with an aeoline register. Schlimbach made no attempt to protect his invention, but freely showed the instrument to everyone who wanted to see it, with the inevitable result that a number of people patented very similar instruments in Vienna. Indeed, Buschmann's father Johann wrote in a letter of 30 October 1829 that he was thinking of taking out a patent for the new instrument in Bavaria. \n Hamburg \n In 1833 Buschmann married and moved to Hamburg, where he opened a new workshop of his own. There he made mostly physharmonicas , bellows-operated wind instruments, each of which also had a large manual keyboard. For a physharmonica with built-in terpodion he won the great gold medal at the Hamburg Arts and Trades Exhibition of 1838. He died in Hamburg in 1864.", "parametric_answer": "harmonica", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

{"question": "What is the more common name for atmospheric vapour frozen in a crystalline form", "answers": ["snow"], "context": "climate - Types of precipitation | meteorology ...climate - Types of precipitation | meteorology | Britannica.com \n Types of precipitation \n Köppen climate classification \n Drizzle \n Liquid precipitation in the form of very small drops, with diameters between 0.2 and 0.5 mm (0.008 and 0.02 inch) and terminal velocities between 70 and 200 cm per second (28 and 79 inches per second), is defined as drizzle. It forms by the coalescence of even smaller droplets in low-layer clouds containing weak updrafts of only a few centimetres per second. High relative humidity below the cloud base is required to prevent the drops from evaporating before reaching the ground; drizzle is classified as slight, moderate, or thick. Slight drizzle produces negligible runoff from the roofs of buildings, and thick drizzle accumulates at a rate in excess of 1 mm per hour (0.04 inch per hour). \n Rain and freezing rain \n Liquid waterdrops with diameters greater than those of drizzle constitute rain. Raindrops rarely exceed 6 mm (0.2 inch) in diameter because they become unstable when larger than this and break up during their fall. The terminal velocities of raindrops at ground level range from 2 metres per second (7 feet per second) for the smallest to about 10 metres per second (30 feet per second) for the largest. The smaller raindrops are kept nearly spherical by surface-tension forces, but, as the diameter surpasses about 2 mm (0.08 inch), they become increasingly flattened by aerodynamic forces. When the diameter reaches 6 mm, the undersurface of the drop becomes concave because of the airstream, and the surface of the drop is sheared off to form a rapidly expanding “bubble” or “bag” attached to an annular ring containing the bulk of the water. Eventually the bag bursts into a spray of fine droplets, and the ring breaks up into a circlet of millimetre-sized drops. \n A rain shaft piercing a tropical sunset as seen from Man-o’-War Bay, Tobago, Caribbean Sea. \n NOAA \n mineral \n Rain of a given intensity is composed of a spectrum of drop sizes, the average and median drop diameters being larger in rains of greater intensity. The largest drops, which have a diameter greater than 5 mm (0.2 inch), appear only in the heavy rains of intense storms. \n When raindrops fall through a cold layer of air (colder than 0 °C, or 32 °F) and become supercooled, freezing rain occurs. The drops may freeze on impact with the ground to form a very slippery and dangerous “glazed” ice that is difficult to see because it is almost transparent. \n Snow and sleet \n Snow in the atmosphere can be subdivided into ice crystals and snowflakes. Ice crystals generally form on ice nuclei at temperatures appreciably below the freezing point. Below −40 °C (−40 °F) water vapour can solidify without the presence of a nucleus. Snowflakes are aggregates of ice crystals that appear in an infinite variety of shapes, mainly at temperatures near the freezing point of water. \n A strong winter wind blows snow and bends trees. \n Pal Hermansen—Stone/Getty Images \n Colorado’s fine, light snow attracts millions of skiers every year. \n Ron Dahlquist—Stone/Getty Images \n In British terminology, sleet is the term used to describe precipitation of snow and rain together or of snow melting as it falls. In the United States, it is used to denote partly frozen ice pellets. \n Snow crystals generally have a hexagonal pattern, often with beautifully intricate shapes. Three- and 12-branched forms occur occasionally. The hexagonal form of the atmospheric ice crystals, their varying size and shape notwithstanding, is an outward manifestation of an internal arrangement in which the oxygen atoms form an open lattice (network) with hexagonally symmetrical structure. According to a recent internationally accepted classification, there are seven types of snow crystals: plates, stellars, columns, needles, spatial dendrites, capped columns, and irregular crystals. The size and shape of the snow crystals depend mainly on the temperature of their formation and on the amount of water vapour that is available for deposition.

Since the band's formation, they have consisted of Bono (real name Paul Hewson) (vocals, guitar, harmonica), The Edge (real name David Evans) (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass) and Larry Mullen, Jr. (drums, percussion). The band is the biggest selling alternative rock act of all time, having sold 140 million albums worldwide as of 2008. They have won 22 Grammys and were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. As of 2009, they have released 12 albums and 58 singles. \n Foundation: The band originally formed in 1976 when Larry Mullen posted a bulletin in his school asking for musicians to form a rock band. The band then consisted of the four current members plus three additional guitarists, including The Edge's brother Dick Evans (later a member of Virgin Prunes), Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin. According to legend, Bono originally auditioned as a guitarist but couldn't play. He auditioned as lead vocals, but really couldn't sing. He was, however, incredibly enthusiastic about the band, extremely charismatic, a great writer, and was strangely able to reach the audience when the band played, something he is known for still today. Bono will reach out into the crowd and dance or mess with someone in the crowd at every concert. He was kept as a member. The extra guitarists would soon leave the band and the group would go through the names ?Feedback ? and ?The Hype? before finally settling on U2. \n The 70s & 80s: 1978 was a jumping point year for the band, finally finding their sound / voice. U2 won a talent contest in 1978: ?500 and funds to make a record. Paul McGuinness became the band's manager and U2 released an EP called Three and the single Another Day, the following year. U2 went on to release their first album, Boy and then more critically acclaimed albums incl.: October, War, Under A Blood Red Sky, and The Unforgettable Fire (featuring the song PlayMLK dedicated to Martin Luther King Jr). Seen by many as a political band with more charisma than others, they were called ?a different kind? of band. After a short break U2 returned with The Joshua Tree & the USA music inspired Rattle And Hum (also a movie of the same name, based on the tour). \n The 90s: Promising ?to dream it all up again?, they added industrial and dance styles to their music. Trying to drop a goody two shoes image, they went to Berlin (Germany), supposedly to develop new self-expressions. From there they started to make fun of themselves and had a good time of it in albums like Achtung Baby (meaning ?watch out, baby?, artwork feat. make-up artist Nassim Khalifa) & Zooropa. Bono took on many stage personae such as ?The Fly?, ?Mirrorball Man? and ?Mr. MacPhisto? for the gigantic ZOO TV Tour. Later they continued to make fun of Pop culture and all its extremes with the album Pop and consequent PopMart tour which was announced to be launched at a Kmart store and included a giant golden arch across the stage. \n The 00s: At the end of the 90's into 00's U2 became less Image and more reality. With the death of Bono's good friend Michael Hutchence the lead singer of INXS, Bono wrote more songs from the heart surrounding ideas like life and death, children, hope, and the real world past all the pop culture and TV. Some say they've returned to a more band-centric sound with albums like All That You Can&rsquo;t Leave Behind which features a song, Kite, dedicated to Bono's father who passed away shortly after the album's conception and 2004's How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. \n The Name: There are", "parametric_answer": "arctic monkeys", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

The Overloaded Ark by Gerald Durrell | LibraryThingThe Overloaded Ark by Gerald Durrell | LibraryThing \n   \n thesmellofbooks | Jul 13, 2014 | \n Naturalist and author Gerald Durrell writes in an open, friendly manner while still managing to impart a lot of information and his first book, The Overloaded Ark, is a fine example of the style and humor that were to become his trademarks in all his later works. This is the story of his first animal collecting expedition as he travels to British Cameroon in 1947 with ornithologist John Yealland. Their primary goal was in the collecting of birds, reptiles and small mammals that were shipped back to various zoos in Britain. \n Although well able to see the funny side of his interactions with both the natives as well as the animals that he came into contact with, I couldn’t help but miss the laugh-out-loud humor that is to be found in his Corfu Trilogy. The difference is his exuberance and delight in poking fun at his family members that was such a big part of the trilogy. \n The Overloaded Ark is a delightful, yet somewhat dated read. What does remain fresh is Durrell’s obvious love of nature and his winsome manner in passing these stories on to his readers. ( \n ) \n 1 \n DeltaQueen50 | Apr 3, 2014 | \n Durrell's voice is winsome, I think, and a little wry, which to my ear dates more slowly than some other, more proper and ponderous nature writers. I've seen other reviewers complaining about the use of pidgin and the colonial attitude evinced by the author, but it strikes me as perfectly accurate to the early 1950s. There are also parts about the trapping, keeping, and selling animals I find unsavoury but true to the times. On the whole, though, his sheer love of wildlife wins the day for me, and Durrell expostulating with dilatory young boys holding dead birds (which they insist are perfectly healthy) is laugh-out-loud funny even after all this time.

They are; therefore related to the qualities of enthusiasm and zeal, love, passion, courage, speed, enterprise, individuality and spirituality. Note that this triplicity has its beginning in the cardinai sign Aries which is the flrst sign, which rules the east or sunrlse or the beginning of self. The note that is struck in the beginning of a triplicity is the ruling note of that group of signs, hence the ruling note of the fire Triplicity is SELF. \n Now when we speak of self, we may mean a vain egotistical kind o-f a person, but we ean also mean something much greater and sometimes very flne. We can meet a person who has developed his own innate powers to such an extent that he stands above all other people as being highly individualised. He is not conceited, not anxious to show off certain powers for example Prof Milliken, the great scientist who has discovered the Milliken Rays is not a vain man but he worked so steadily and so well in his science that he is sure enough of his own powers to know when he has something to present to the world. He is an Arian. \n If a chart is found to have the majority of planets in fire signs, we shall find that with the finest types of people there will be shown: creative mind energy, invention, pioneer work, particularly if the sign Aries is emphasised. Radiative kindness, individualised effort, faith, particularly when the sign Leo is emphasised. Aspiration, the gift of intuition, the love of justice and religion, particularly when the sign Sagittarius is emphasised. \n If, however, we are dealing with a very ordinary type of person, the planets will work out is making a selfish or egotistic type in the matters relating to the natural houses of the fire signs. Thus many planets in Aries will tend to make the person think almost entirely of himself, his appearance et cetera. His conversation is full of words “I”, and “me”. Many planets in Leo will tend to make the person think vaingloriously concerning his children. His conversation is full of the words ‘my children’ or he may spend his time talking about himself in relation to his love affairs or his speculations for these are also the 5th house affairs. \n Many planets and Sagittarius tend to make the person think of himself in relation to 9th house affairs thus his conversation Is largely concerning “my travels”, “my in-laws”,”my church, political opinions, philosophy, pleasures and games” it is evident than that the fire people can be first-class laws if they do not try to get out of the entirely personal life into something on which they can spend their enthusiasm. \n Speaking of the signs in a larger cosmic sense, Aries is irresponsible naturally. His sense of responsibility is developed in the fixed sign of Leo, which rules children: thus he learns responsibility through children. Then in Sagittarius he learns a larger responsibility which has to do with people outside of his own family. So in Sagittarius he learns justice, law and religion and feels a responsibility toward living up to the noblest ideals that come to him and also a responsibility in presenting these ideas to humanity.

{"question": "Ford Prefect came from a star in which constellation?", "answers": ["orion"], "context": "h2g2 - Betelgeuse - the Star - Edited Entryh2g2 - Betelgeuse - the Star - Edited Entry \n - The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams \n Betelgeuse is probably the most well-known star in the sky... with the possible exception of Alpha Centauri , Sirius and the Pole Star. \n It lies in the constellation of Orion , at a distance of around 470 light years, and is 20 times as massive as the Sun. Its name comes from the Arabic, ibt al jauzah, meaning 'armpit of the central one' - a reference to Orion himself. We can only speculate about the unflattering names lifeforms from Betelgeuse might have about our star. \n The constellation of Orion is one of the grandest in the northern hemisphere. Orion, the hunter, is depicted with a sword in his belt, raising a club and holding a shield toward Taurus the bull, which is above and to the west. One story tells of the great Orion stung to death by a scorpion. He was then cast to the sky, so that he sets as the constellation Scorpius rises. The most impressive sight in the constellation is that of the Great Orion nebula, M42. This can be seen with the naked eye, and considerable detail can be picked out using a good pair of binoculars . \n The constellation is also noteworthy for the Orionid meteor shower , whose radiant is on the Geminid border. These meteors shower around October 21. \n Although slightly fainter than Rigel (Orion's left foot), Betelgeuse is given the reference alpha orionis, having a stellar magnitude of around 0.4. It is, however, an irregular variable, which means that the fluctuations in its brightness do not follow a regular pattern. Its brightness can drop to below magnitude 1.3 over a period lasting 5.8 years. During this fluctuation, the star's diameter can vary between 300 and 400 times that of the Sun . \n Betelgeuse has a surface temperature of 3000K 1 and a spectral classification of M2 ( red ). In 1975, astronomers were able to use image-processing to construct a map of brightness (and therefore temperature) variations on Betelgeuse's surface - the first time any such study had been performed on any star. \n For the amateur astronomers, Betelgeuse lies at Declination +07d 24m 26s, RA 05h 55m 10.2s (for epoch 2000). \n Literary References \n Incidentally, the characters Ford Prefect and Zaphod Beeblebrox from The Hitch Hikers' Guide to the Galaxy originally hailed from the vicinity of Betelgeuse. \n 'You know,' said Arthur, 'it's at times like this, when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young...'  StarA star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. \n For at least a portion of its life, a star shines due to thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then radiates into outer space. Almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by stellar nucleosynthesis during the star's lifetime, and for some stars by supernova nucleosynthesis when it explodes. Near the end of its life, a star can also contain degenerate matter. Astronomers can determine the mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), and many other properties of a star by observing its motion through space, its luminosity, and", "parametric_answer": "betelgeuse", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

Where are they from, what are their compositions and some special features about them. \n 1. TEA \n Tea is a drink made by infusing leaves of the tea plant in hot water. The name ‘tea’ is also used to refer to the leaves themselves; and it is also the name of a mid- to late-afternoon meal in the British Isles and associated countries, at which tea (the drink) is served along with various foods. \n Tea has been an item of trade and tribute for at least three thousand years. It was first cultivated and brewed in China, and many of the best varieties still come from China. Some of the finest oolongs in the world are grown in Taiwan. Japan also produces a considerable amount of green tea, most of which is consumed domestically. \n After the British took up tea drinking, they began cultivating the plants native to India in order to have more control over the trade. India, Sri Lanka, and other South Asian countries produce a large portion of the world harvest. \n Never miss a post about healthy drinks, like our page \n Drink Healthy Drinks on Facebook. \n Standage says tea played a leading role in the expansion of imperial and industrial might in Great Britain many centuries later. During the 19th century, the East India Company enjoyed a monopoly on tea exports from China. \n As the Industrial Revolution of 18th and 19th centuries gained steam, tea provided some of the fuel. Factory workers stayed alert during long, monotonous shifts thanks to welcome tea breaks. \n The beverage also had unintended health benefits for rapidly growing urban areas. \n 2. WATER \n Water (H2O) is often perceived to be ordinary as it is transparent, odorless, tasteless and ubiquitous. It is the simplest compound of the two most common reactive elements, consisting of just two hydrogen atoms attached to a single oxygen atom. Indeed, very few molecules are smaller or lighter. \n From a biological standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of life that set it apart from other substances. It carries out this role by allowing organic compounds to react in ways that ultimately allow replication. All known forms of life depend on water. Without water, your body would stop working properly. Water makes up more than half of your body weight and a person can’t survive for more than a few days without it. Why? Your body has lots of important jobs and it needs water to do many of them. For instance, your blood, which contains a lot of water, carries oxygen to all the cells of your body. Without oxygen, those tiny cells would die and your body would stop working. In addition to being an important part of the fluids in your body, each cell depends on water to function normally. \n 3. COFFEE \n Coffee is a well-known beverage prepared from coffee beans, of the coffee plant. \n The story of how coffee growing and drinking spread around the world is one of the greatest and most romantic in history and starts in the Arabian Peninsula, where roasted beans were first brewed around A.D. 1000. Sometime around the 15th century coffee spread throughout the Arab world. \n When coffee arrived in Europe it was similarly hailed as an “anti-alcohol” that was quite welcome during the Age of Reason in the 18th century. \n Coffee raises capacity for work, gives strengths and energy and topes up. But there is a negative coffee’s influence in the human’s health because of its caffeine. \n Coffee also fuelled commerce and", "parametric_answer": "water", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

You can read the full story of why I’m doing this in my Introduction post . The previous post was a review of ‘The Mysterious Affair at Styles’ . \n I’ve said a few times that this project is going to be rather completist – I can’t watch ‘Curtain’ until I’ve rewatched all the other episodes and reread all the stories and novels. But as I approached ‘How Does Your Garden Grow?’, it occurred to me that, to be truly completist, I might have to dip into some of Agatha Christie’s other writing as well. You see, there are some characters in the Poirot stories who appear in non-Poirot stories as well. To do justice to the project, shouldn’t I be looking at the full careers of these characters? \n As far as I remember, there are five significant characters who appear in both Poirot and non-Poirot stories: Miss Lemon, Ariadne Oliver, Mr Satterthwaite, Colonel Race and Superintendent Battle. (And there’s also Mr Robinson and Colonel Pikeaway from Cat Among the Pigeons – but I must confess I’d completely forgotten about these characters until I started writing this post, so I’ll have to decide what to do about them later.) My plan is to write about the ‘further adventures’ of each of these characters just before I reach the first Poirot story/novel in which they appear. In some cases (like Miss Lemon), that means writing about a character who has already appeared in the TV series; in other cases (like Superintendent Battle), it means writing about a character who doesn’t appear in the TV series at all. Interestingly, all five characters made their debuts in non-Poirot stories (either standalone novels or less well-known detective series) before entering the world of the famous Belgian sleuth, so their earlier appearances (possibly) act as backstory to their roles in the Poirot stories. \n So… the first character with a backstory is Poirot’s efficient secretary Miss Lemon. \n Miss Lemon (and it’s just ‘Miss’ Lemon for now – she won’t get a first name until 1955 and Hickory Dickory Dock) made her first appearance as Poirot’s secretary in ‘How Does Your Garden Grow?’, which was first published in 1935. I’m going to talk more about that story in my next post, so for now I want to look at a couple of stories featuring Miss Lemon from 1932. \n Parker Pyne Investigates was first published by William Collins in 1934. (For info, I’m using the 1968 Pan Books edition, which I apparently bought for 29p in an Oxfam shop. As I’m sure I’ll mention in some future posts, I worked full-time in an Oxfam shop after finishing my A-Levels, and I read a lot of Christie during this time. Most of the older paperback editions I own have Oxfam prices pencilled on the first page, so I assume most of them were bought at that time.) \n Parker Pyne appears in fourteen short stories by Agatha Christie – the twelve that are collected in Parker Pyne Investigates, ‘Problem at Pollensa Bay’ (published in 1935) and ‘The Regatta Mystery’ (more on that one in a later post). As a detective, he is quite a different kettle of fish to Hercule Poirot. In fact, in the first six stories in which he appears, he is hardly a ‘detective’ at all. \n Parker Pyne advertises his services with a cryptic – but enticing – announcement in newspapers: \n ‘Are you happy? If not, consult Mr Parker Pyne, 17 Richmond Street.’ \n The cases he takes on in the first six stories are, then, cases of (usually domestic) unhappiness, as is clear from the titles: ‘The Case of the Middle-Aged Wife", "parametric_answer": "nero wolfe", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

Walk up to the bar and say “Bartender, I’ll have a Sex on the Beach, please.” Side-splitting and knee-slapping humor, indeed. \n What’s in a name? well, when it comes to our favorite drinks, a lot. Many drinks are named for the place they were invented, like the “Manhattan”, “Long Island Ice Tea”, and the “Daquiri” (Daquiri, Cuba). Some are named for their ingredients, which is pretty boring, but descriptive. Witness “7 & 7”, “Jack and Coke”, “Lemon Drop”. \n Then there are those cocktails with more interesting origins. Here are five. \n Screwdriver \n One of the most popular drinks in the world, the Screwdriver can serve as a base for many other popular drinks. The origins of the cocktail are clandestine. In the 1950s, workers on oil rigs in the Persian Gulf would work incredibly long and dangerous hours. So, of course they relieved the tedium with alcohol. Apparently, a few of them, some sources say a mix of Turks, Serbs, Albanians, American engineers, and maybe a Greek or two, poured orange juice and vodka into cans while working on the rigs. The name came from the workers using a screwdriver to stir their secret alcoholic elixir. \n Outside the US, it is often referred to as “vodka and orange”, but no matter where you order it, the two base ingredients are the same. Variations include: the “Poor Man’s Screwdriver” (substitute Sunny D for orange juice); the “Tang Banger” (use TANG); the “Brass Monkey” (a traditional Screwdriver with dark rum added); and the popular “Harvey Wallbanger” (splash some Galliano on top). \n 2 ounces vodka \n 5 ounces fresh orange juice \n Slice of orange \n Fuzzy Navel \n We have to turn our attention to an unlikely place to learn the origins of this drink. At the Wagon Tongue Bar in Omaha, Nebraska, the Fuzzy Navel was born in the 1980s. The 80’s were a time of renewed interest in highballs, cocktails, and mixed drinks. A liquor distributor named Jack Sherman came up with the concoction, made by combining peach schnapps and orange juice. “Fuzzy” refers to the peach, and “navel” to the orange. A  New York Times food and drink critic described the ensuing craze as “a kind of cult, rallying points for young drinkers in search of fun and not too picky about taste”. \n By adding vodka to the fuzzy navel you turn the Fuzzy Navel into a “Hairy Navel”, the “hair” referring to the increased strength of alcohol in the drink. \n 1 1/2 ounces peach schnapps \n orange juice to fill \n Pour the peach schnapps into a highball glass filled with ice cubes, top with orange juice, stir well. \n Tom Collins \n Talk about an interesting tale, the story of how Tom Collins came about is bizarre and traces back to a much different time in American society. \n In Pennsylvania in the 19th century, Tom Collins was the name given to a fictional bogeyman who gossiped about locals. Patrons in pubs and restaurants would sprinkle their conversation with “Have you seen Tom Collins?” And, eventually, to be “known by Tom Collins” was to imply that someone was talking about that person. Newspapers ran hoax stories claiming to be about the real Tom Collins, who invariably was in trouble of some sort. It became so popular that “Tom Collins folk songs” were written and performed on stages all over the east coast. By the mid-1870s Tom Collins had a secure place in American folk lore. \n The", "parametric_answer": "root beer", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}
{"question": "Who is currently the Supreme Governor of the Church of England?", "answers": ["elizabeth ii", "queen elizabeth ii"], "context": "Church of EnglandThe Church of England is the established Christian church in England and the mother church of the worldwide Anglican Communion. The church has both liberal and conservative clergy and members.  \n The church dates its establishment to the 6th-century Gregorian mission in Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury.   The English church renounced papal authority when Henry VIII sought to secure an annulment from Catherine of Aragon in the 1530s. The English Reformation accelerated under Edward VI's regents before a brief restoration of Catholicism under Queen Mary I and King Philip. The Act of Supremacy 1558 renewed the breach and the Elizabethan Settlement charted a course whereby the English church was to be both Catholic and Reformed: \n * Catholic in that it views itself as a part of the universal church of Jesus Christ in unbroken continuity with the early apostolic church. This is expressed in its emphasis on the teachings of the early Church Fathers, as formalised in the Apostles', Nicene, and Athanasian creeds.   \n * Reformed in that it has been shaped by some of the doctrinal principles of the 16th-century Protestant Reformation, in particular in the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion and the Book of Common Prayer. \n In the earlier phase of the English Reformation there were Catholic martyrs but some radical Protestants were martyred as well. The later phases saw the Penal Laws punish both Catholic and nonconforming Protestants. In the 17th century, political and religious disputes raised the Puritan and Presbyterian faction to control of the church, but this ended with the Restoration. Papal recognition of George III in 1766 led to greater religious tolerance. \n Since the English Reformation, the Church of England has used a liturgy in English. The church contains several doctrinal strands, the main three known as Anglo-Catholic, Evangelical and Broad Church. Tensions between theological conservatives and progressives find expression in debates over the ordination of women and homosexuality. \n The governing structure of the church is based on dioceses, each presided over by a bishop. Within each diocese are local parishes. The Archbishop of Canterbury is the Primate of All England, leading the Church of England and acting as a focus of unity for the wider Anglican Communion. The Supreme Governor of the Church of England is the British monarch, currently Elizabeth II, whose role is largely ceremonial. The General Synod of the Church of England is the legislative body for the church and comprises bishops, other clergy and laity. Its measures must be approved by both Houses of Parliament. \n History \n Early Christianity in England \n According to tradition, Christianity arrived in Britain in the 1st or 2nd century, during which time southern Britain became part of the Roman Empire. The earliest historical evidence of Christianity among the native Britons is found in the writings of such early Christian Fathers as Tertullian and Origen in the first years of the 3rd century. Three Romano-British bishops, including Restitutus, are known to have been present at the Council of Arles in 314.  Others attended the Council of Sardica in 347 and that of Ariminum in 360, and a number of references to the church in Roman Britain are found in the writings of 4th century Christian fathers. Britain was the home of Pelagius, who opposed Augustine of Hippo's doctrine of original sin.  \n While Christianity was long established as the religion of the Britons at the time of the Anglo-Saxon invasion, Christian Britons made little progress in converting the newcomers from their native paganism. Consequently, in 597, Pope Gregory I sent the prior of the Abbey of St Andrew's (later canonised as Augustine of Canterbury) from Rome to evangelise the Angles. This event is known as the Gregorian mission and is the date the Church of England generally marks as the beginning of its formal history. With the help of Christians already residing in Kent, Augustine established his church at Canterbury, the capital of the Kingdom of Kent, and became the first in the series of Archbishops of Canterbury in 598. A later archbishop, the Greek Theodore of Tarsus, also contributed to the organisation of Christianity in England. \n While some Celtic Christian practices were changed at the Synod of Whitby, the Christian Church in the British Isles was", "parametric_answer": "queen", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

The territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2)  and with over 320 million people, the United States is the world's third largest country by total area (and fourth largest by land area) and the third most populous. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of  large-scale immigration from many other countries.  The geography and climate are also extremely diverse, and the country is home to a wide variety of wildlife.  \n Paleo-Indians migrated from Asia to the North American mainland at least 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the United States by Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire.Greene, Jack P.; Pole, J.R., eds. (2008). A Companion to the American Revolution. pp. 352–361. The current constitution was adopted in 1788, after the Articles of Confederation, adopted in 1781, were felt to have provided inadequate federal powers. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties. \n The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, displacing American Indian tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848.  During the second half of the 19th century, the American Civil War led to the end of legal slavery in the country.   By the end of that century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean,  and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar.

The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the U.S. as the world's sole superpower. \n The United States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal and real GDP. It ranks highly in several measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage,  human development, per capita GDP, and productivity per person.  While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services, the manufacturing sector remains the second largest in the world.

{"question": "The majority of the land area of Africa lies in which hemisphere?", "answers": ["northern"], "context": "Geography of the Southern Hemisphere and FactsGeography of the Southern Hemisphere and Facts \n Share \n By Amanda Briney \n The Southern Hemisphere is the southern portion or half of the Earth ( map ). It begins at the equator at 0° and continues south into higher latitudes until it reaches 90°S or the South Pole in the middle of Antarctica. The word hemisphere itself specifically means half of a sphere, and because the earth is spherical (although it is considered an oblate sphere ) a hemisphere is half. \n Geography and Climate of the Southern Hemisphere \n In comparison to the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere has fewer land masses and more water. The South Pacific, South Atlantic, Indian Oceans and various seas such as the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand and the Weddell Sea near Antarctica make up around 80.9% of the Southern Hemisphere. Land comprises only 19.1%. In the Northern Hemisphere, the majority of area is composed of land masses instead of water. \n The continents making up the Southern Hemisphere include all of Antarctica, around 1/3 of Africa, most of South America and nearly all of Australia. \n continue reading below our video \n Overview of the Four Seasons \n Because of the large presence of water in the Southern Hemisphere, climate in the Earth's southern half is more mild overall than the Northern Hemisphere. In general, water heats and cools more slowly than land so water near any land area usually has a moderating effect on the land's climate. Since water surrounds land in much of the Southern Hemisphere, more of it is moderated than in the Northern Hemisphere. \n The Southern Hemisphere, like the Northern Hemisphere is also divided into several different regions based on climate. The most prevalent is the southern temperate zone , which runs from the Tropic of Capricorn to the beginning of the Arctic Circle at 66.5°S. This area features a temperate climate which generally has large amounts of precipitation, cold winters and warm summers. Some countries included in the southern temperate zone include most of Chile , all of New Zealand and Uruguay. The area directly north of the southern temperate zone and lying between the equator and the Tropic of Capricorn is known as the tropics- an area which has warm temperatures and precipitation year round. \n South of the southern temperate zone is the Antarctic Circle and the Antarctic continent. Antarctica, unlike the rest of the Southern Hemisphere is not moderated by the large presence of water because it is a very large land mass. In addition, it is considerably colder than the Arctic in the Northern Hemisphere for the same reason. \n Summer in the Southern Hemisphere lasts from around December 21 to the vernal equinox around March 20 . Winter lasts from around June 21 to the autumnal equinox around September 21. These dates are due to the Earth's axial tilt and from the period of December 21 to March 20, the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, while during the June 21 to September 21 interval, it is tilted away from the sun. \n The Coriolis Effect and the Southern Hemisphere \n An important component of physical geography in the Southern Hemisphere is the Coriolis Effect and the specific direction that objects are deflected in Earth's southern half. In the southern hemisphere any object moving over the Earth's surface deflects to the left. Because of this, any large patterns in air or water turn counterclockwise south of the equator. For example, there are many large oceanic gyres in the North Atlantic and North Pacific- all of which turn counterclockwise. In the Northern Hemisphere these directions are reversed because objects are deflected to the right. \n In addition, the left deflection of objects impacts the flows of air over the Earth. A high pressure system for example is an area where the atmospheric pressure is greater than that of the surrounding area. In the Southern Hemisphere, these move counterclockwise because of the Coriolis Effect. By contrast, low pressure systems or areas where atmospheric pressure is less than that of the surrounding area move clockwise because of the Coriolis Effect in the Southern Hemisphere. \n Population and the Southern Hemisphere \n Because the Southern Hemisphere has less land area than the Northern Hemisphere it should be noted that population is less in Earth's southern half than", "parametric_answer": "southern", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

However this is the first attempt I have ever made, & yet I perceive that I shall soon & easily acquire a fine facility in its use. . . .The machine has several virtues. I believe it will print faster than I can write. One may lean back in his chair & work it. It piles an awful stack of words on one page. It don't muss things or scatter ink blots around. Of course it saves paper.\" \n Twain, who made a point of assailing most machinery in his short stories, is reputed to be the world's first author to use a typewriter. His manuscript for Life on the Mississippi arrived at the publisher's neatly set down in typewritten form. \n Queen Anne awards first patent \n Perfected in the nineteenth century, the notion of making a machine to produce letters automatically began during the reign of Queen Anne, the eighteenth-century British monarch. In 1714, she awarded a patent to Henry Mill, an engineer, for: \n \"An artifical machine or method for the impressing or transcribing of letters singly or progressively one after another, as in writing, whereby all writings whatsoever may be engrossed in paper or parchment so that the said machine or method may be of great use in settlements and publick recors, the impression being deeper and more lasting than any other writing, and not to be erased or counterfeited without manifest discovery.\" \n But if Mr. Mill's invention ever gained \"great use in settlements,\" no record exists. He left no model, no drawings, no information about himself. Queen Anne's patent remains the only mention of his typewriting device. \n Men continued to work on the development of the typewriter, but without the official recognition accorded to Mr. Mill. \n Early American efforts \n Not until 1829, when an American named William Austin Burt received a patent for a \"typographer\" is there any further record of a typewriting invention. Burt's \"Typographer\" looked very much like a butcher's block and, unfortunately, performed with about the same delicacy. A patent office fire in 1836 destroyed the only model of Mr. Burt's machine; subsequently, however, a copy of his device was built and exhibited at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago. \n Two of the most common features of today's typewriters were developed in the nineteenth century. Burt was the first to use type bars, while the metal levers which bear the letters and numerals, and the moveable carriage were devised independently by another inventor, Charles Thurber. The movable carriage first appeared on Mr. Thurber's machine in 1843. \n Numerous other men tried to perfect a typing machine during the next few decades of the nineteenth century, but each effort had more than its share of flaws. The most prevalent drawback was speed; for all of their mechanical wizardry, the early typewriters performed more slowly than a man with a pen. \n In all, more than 50 men attempted to develop a typewriting device before the first practical typewriter was put together. \n The first practical typewriter \n A printer from Milwaukee deserves the credit for inventing the forerunner of the typewriter we know today. Christopher Latham Sholes, working with Carlos Glidden and Samuel Soule, began by trying to develop a machine which would print numbers consecutively on the pages of a book. In 1867, Glidden asked why Sholes's machine had to print only numerals, why it could not be made to reproduce the letters of the alphabet. Later that same year, Sholes built the first prototype of his typewriter, admittedly limited in its utility, for it could print only the letter \"w.\" But it worked", "parametric_answer": "r", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

It was the second and final of his two No. 1 hits in the UK Singles Chart; the first being \"Side Saddle\". \n Russ Conway DSM (2 Sep 1925 – 16 Nov 2000) was a British popular music pianist. Conway had 20 piano instrumentals in the UK Singles Chart between 1957 and 1963, including two number one hits. \n Conway was born Trevor Herbert Stanford in Bristol England. He won a scholarship to Bristol Cathedral Choir School and was largely self-taught on piano as he whiled away hours as a youngster during a three-year term in borstal. His father then let him join the Merchant Navy. \n Conscripted into the Royal Navy in 1942, he served in the Merchant Navy from 1942 to 1948, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal as signalman in a minesweeping flotilla \"for distinguished service, efficiency and zeal\" in clearance of mines in the Aegean and operations during the relief of Greece 1944–45. During his Navy service, he lost the tip of the third finger of his right hand while using a bread slicer. He was discharged on health grounds because of a stomach ulcer. \n Conway was talent-spotted while playing in a London club, signed to EMI's Columbia label and spent the mid-1950s providing backing for artists on their roster, including Gracie Fields and Joan Regan. He recorded his first solo single \"Party Pops\" in 1957, a \"medley of standard songs\" which included \"Roll the Carpet Up\" and \"The Westminster Waltz\". \n Between 1957 and 1963, Conway had 20 UK chart hits, achieving a cumulative total of 83 weeks on the UK Singles Chart in 1959 alone. This included two self-penned number one instrumentals, \"Side Saddle\" and \"Roulette\", the latter deposing Elvis Presley's \"A Fool Such As I\". He was a fixture on light entertainment TV shows and radio for many years afterwards, appearing at the London Palladium on a number of occasions and becoming a regular on the Billy Cotton Band Show for several seasons. He also made recordings as a vocalist. \n He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1959, when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews during a recording session at the BBC's Studio 1 at 201 Piccadilly, London. \n His career was blighted by ill health, including a nervous breakdown and subsequently a stroke, which prevented him from performing between 1968 and 1971. He also at times drank heavily and smoked up to 80 cigarettes a day. He was prescribed anti-depressants and had periods of severe self-doubt. But he kept up playing. Having been diagnosed with stomach cancer in the late 1980s, in 1990 he founded the Russ Conway Cancer Fund with his friend, writer and broadcaster Richard Hope-Hawkins, and they staged charity gala shows in major theatres that raised thousands of pounds for cancer charities. \n He appeared as himself in French and Saunders' 1994 Christmas special, playing \"Side Saddle\" - or, in an alternative edit, the Gerry and the Pacemakers hit \"I Like It\" - in their spoof of The Piano. \n Conway, who never married, died on 16 Nov 2000, just two weeks after his last public performance. Richard Hope-Hawkins delivered the main eulogy at the funeral held at the historic St Mary's Church, Redcliffe, Bristol. Elton John sent a wreath. In 2001 Hope-Hawkins devised, staged and directed a tribute to Conway at the Colston Hall, Bristol, with an all-star cast.

He was tried and executed in York, assuring his place in English history and being forever linked with the city. \n The Only Way is Essex \n Richard ‘Dick’ Turpin was born in 1705 in Hempstead, Essex. His father John was an innkeeper and a butcher; Turpin became an apprentice butcher. He married at twenty and five years later, then with his own butcher’s shop, he aided the prolific deer-poaching Gregory Gang, disposing of carcasses. \n Landlord in Gangland London \n By 1734 Turpin had become landlord of a pub at Clay Hill. His association with the gang was such that he joined them in brutal attacks and robberies in the outer London area. In 1735 after three gang members were arrested the youngest betrayed his fellows, Turpin being named by The London Gazette. Foolishly Turpin and the gang immediately committed further shocking assaults in the Essex area with three more gang members arrested and executed at Tyburn on 10 March. Turpin was named on the indictments for burglary. \n Dick Turpin’s Grave lies in St. George’s Graveyard in a mainly residential part of York \n Wanted Man \n Turning to highway robbery from April 1735, he plagued Epping Forest, Southwark and other London areas. On 10 July, identified and named as ‘Turpin the butcher’, along with Thomas Rowden with a bounty of £100 on their heads, the duo’s crimes continued throughout 1735. \n Next referred to in February 1737 Turpin reportedly spent the night at Puckeridge with his wife, her maid and another man. Turpin’s letter arranging the meeting (for horse stealing) was intercepted by the authorities. Turpin escaped while the others were arrested and imprisoned. \n Undeterred Highwayman \n The following month Turpin took up with highwaymen Matthew King and Stephen Potter, committing a series of robberies, culminating in an incident at Whitechapel when either King or Turpin stole a horse near Waltham Forest. Joseph Major, along with Richard Bayes, identified his animal, found tethered at The Red Lion, Whitechapel, and waited, along with the local constable, for the ‘owner’. King’s brother eventually arrived leading them to his brother Matthew who received serious, but possibly accidental, gunshot wounds, dying the following month. \n Reports varied, stating Turpin or Bayes had shot King. Turpin fled into Epping Forest and on being spotted by Thomas Morris, who was armed, shot and killed him on 4 May with a carbine. ‘The Gentleman’s Magazine’ named Turpin as the suspect – a £200 reward was offered. \n Turpin a.k.a John Palmer comes to Yorkshire \n In June 1737, Turpin, under the alias John Palmer, lodged in Brough , East Yorkshire, posing as a horse trader. He regularly crossed the Humber committing crimes, stealing a horse from Pinchbeck, Lincolnshire, and riding it to his father’s at Hempstead. Leaving the horse behind, implicating his father who was subsequently committed to gaol, Turpin returned to Brough having stolen three more horses from a Thomas Creasy. Creasy finally tracked down and recovered his horses in autumn 1738, thefts for which Turpin was eventually tried. \n His gravestone is the only one in the yard upstanding from the ground (top left) \n Locked up in York Castle \n After a minor incident in October 1738 Turpin threatened to shoot someone; three JPs attended and committed Turpin to the House of Correction at Beverley . The JPs’ suspicions of ‘Palmer’s’ lifestyle proved right when JPs from Long Sutton, Lincolnshire, confirmed Palmer was known there as a sheep-thief and suspected horse-thief who had evaded custody. Turpin was consequently transferred to York Castle on 16 October 1738, for the Assizes. \n Turpin’s final undoing came when his intercepted letter to his brother-in-law revealed his handwriting to James Smith who had taught Turpin to write.

She later became known for the horror classic Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? and was the subject of the memoir Mommie Dearest. She died on May 10, 1977, in New York City. \n Early Life \n Film actress Joan Crawford was born Lucille Fay LeSueur in San Antonio, Texas, on March 23, 1905 (though some sources have reported her birth date as 1908). Her parents separated before she was born, and her mother later married theater owner Harry Cassin. Crawford would come to be known as Billie Cassin growing up, and periodically throughout of her entertainment career. \n After her mother and stepfather split, Crawford attended two private schools, where she worked on the premises to pay for tuition while also being treated harshly, receiving corporal punishment for perceived misdeeds. Because of her workload, she was unable to attend classes and her scholastic record was faked. \n Big Break in 'Our Dancing Daughters' \n After a short time at Stephens College, Crawford left to pursue a  dancing career, a pastime to which she'd dedicated herself. She  eventually danced in the Broadway show Innocent Eyes, and in 1925  started to work onscreen for MGM. She starred in a number of silent  films during this period and was given the name \"Joan Crawford\" from a  magazine contest sponsored by the studio. The actress hit it big with  the smash Our Dancing Daughters (1928), in which she played a rich, lovelorn girl who moves to Charleston. \n A prolific and long-lasting film career was to follow, with Crawford  ultimately going on to star in more than five dozen films. She took on  talking roles with projects like Hollywood Revue (1929) and Grand Hotel (1932), and her dancing skills were prominently displayed with Fred Astaire in the 1933 hit Dancing Lady. Clark Gable was also featured, and was a recurring co-star in works like Possessed (1931) and Strange Cargo (1940). \n Oscar for 'Mildred Pierce' \n Crawford was a major, top-earning star of the 1930s, though by the end of the decade, her pictures were meeting with limited success. She rallied again with A Woman's Face (1941) before leaving MGM and signing with Warner Brothers, eventually garnering the lead role in 1945's Mildred Pierce, about a mother who rises from humble beginnings to become a successful restaurateur. The film received several Academy Award nominations, and Crawford won for best actress. \n Crawford would receive two more Oscar nominations over the years, one for her role as a schizophrenic nurse in another film by the name Possessed (1947),", "parametric_answer": "judy garland", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

Others despised him passionately, along with his raunchy magazine and bunnyeared, bushy-tailed coterie. Whatever everyone thought of him, one thing was never in dispute - for millions of male adolescents during the age of Rock ‘n’ Roll, Hugh Hefner was a cult figure. \n   \n At its peak, a quarter of all American college-age men bought Playboy Magazine every month. It was a must-have part of their lives. They were glued to its pages - even those without the naughty pictures. The magazine kept a whole generation abreast of the basics of the female anatomy; it kept them sane in the jungles of Vietnam, and heralded the sexual revolution of the flower-power era. \n   \n Like it or not, Hefner seemed to have the Midas touch. In 1972, he became the best-selling publisher in the United States when Playboy’s November issue sold 7.2 million copies.

Painted black with a white Playboy logo and the number N950PB on its tail, its rear folding staircase provided direct access to Hefner’s airborne bedroom.

But the creation of rock 'n' roll and Elvis as king had its origins long before he walked into Sun Studio in Memphis to create the magic.  \n The Elvis Presley Birthplace in Tupelo, Mississippi is where it all literally began, and much of the roots of Elvis Presley's exposure to gospel, blues and performance all came together in East Tupelo. \n The northeastern Mississippi city isn't far from Memphis; in fact, many international visitors to Memphis combine visits to Memphis with Tupelo and some of the blues sites across the northern part of the state. It takes about an hour and a half to drive from Graceland in Memphis to Tupelo, so it's easily done as a day trip. \n The Elvis birthplace in Tupelo provides a more intimate look at Elvis Aaron Presley, who was born in a tiny house in East Tupelo on Jan. 8, 1935. Elvis, along with his parents Vernon and Gladys, moved to Memphis in 1948 when he was 13. \n continue reading below our video \n Best Road Trip Apps \n The family lived in different locations in Tupelo, but the birthplace is the actual home where Elvis was born, just a few minutes after his twin brother, Jessie, was stillborn. \n The city bought the house and surrounding property in 1957 when Elvis made his first return back in Tupelo to perform. He donated the proceeds from the concert to purchase the birthplace so that the property could be turned into a public park for the children of East Tupelo who didn't have such facilities. \n Touring the property can take as little as a few minutes or a couple of hours, depending on what is of interest. The Elvis Presley Birthplace Park consists of the birthplace, museum, chapel, gift shop, \"Elvis at 13\" statue, Fountain of Life, Walk of Life, \"Memphis Bound\" car feature, Story Wall and the Assembly of God Church. \n After purchasing tickets, visitors tour the grounds on their own and can choose which attraction to visit first. The recommended path is to walk west to the Walk of Life, a scored concrete circle surrounding the birthplace house with a dated granite block denoting every year of Elvis' life. The first 13 years are commemorated with important facts of each year of his time in Tupelo. \n Next to the Mississippi historic site marker for the birthplace is the modest two-room house that was built by Elvis' father, Vernon, with help from his father, Jessie, and brother, Vester. The home is open for tours, and a guide is in the house describing the features of the home and stories of Elvis and his family in Tupelo. \n After exiting the home, find the 1948 granite block that points to the Elvis at 13 statue, a life-size replica of what Elvis would have looked like at that age. The sculptor worked from photographs in the property's museum to determine Elvis' facial features, hairline and general body size. The statue was unveiled in August 2002. \n Walk past Mississippi music markers denoting Elvis' contributions to and influences by country and blues music, and find the family's childhood church. The actual building where Elvis was exposed to Southern gospel music was moved to the property from its original location nearby and completely restored. A video plays in the church, giving a feel for what church services were like for Elvis. \n Other nearby sites include the Elvis Presley Memorial Chapel, which was a dream of Elvis' and was dedicated in 1979. A story wall features stories from some of Elvis' childhood friends. \n Walking past the Fountain of Life, enter the Elvis Presley Museum, which was originally opened in 1992 and renovated in 2006.

Â They were so popular that during the 1980’s they were a mainstay of childrens television, with both their own tv shows and guest appearances on shows such as Crackerjack . \n They were portrayed on stage as Wee Jimmy Krankie and his father, although in reality they were Scottish husband and wife Ian and Janette Tough. Â Ian was the straight man to Janette’s cheeky schoolboy character, the whole act working so well because Janette was not very tall and so appeared childlike because of this. \n The double act’s main catchphrase was Fan-Dabi-Dozi, which Jimmy Krankie would utter often during the course of their routines, much to the appreciation of the audience who would normally join in. Â They did experiment with other catchphrases (see the video below where they use Hubba-Dubba-Doobie) but ultimately Fan-Dabi-Dozi was what most people will remember most. \n They were initially regular guests on Crackerjack, usually working in rotation with acts such as Basil Brush or The Great Suprendo, but in 1982 they got their own show The Krankies Klub.Â Â This was followed by The Krankies Electronik Komik in 1985 and Krankies TV in the early 1990’s. Â Unfortunately by this time children’s television was becoming a diet of cartoons and shows made in other countries, and there was no room for the more variety hall style humour of The Krankies. Â In 1991 the duo entered semi-retirement, just appearing in pantomime at Christmas. \n In more recent years they have started appearing on Cruise Ships where they appear as both The Krankies and several other characters. Â They are also planning a tour with other famous names from the eighties such as Frank Carson and Jimmy Cricket. \n It seems as though the character of Wee Jimmy Krankie has earned a place in many peoples hearts though, as in 2003 he (she?) was voted “Most Scottish Person In The World” by readers of The Glasgow Herald, and David Tennant suggested Jimmy would make an excellent Timelord to replace him on Doctor Who. Â I have to assume he was joking. \n Take a look at the video below showing The Krankies in action on Crackerjack. Â It’s a surprisingly clever sketch for a kids show. Â Comedy gold!  The KrankiesThe Krankies are a Scottish comedy duo who enjoyed success as a cabaret act in the 1970s and on television in the 1980s, featuring in their own television shows and releasing their own music single. They have regularly appeared in pantomime. The duo comprises wife Janette Tough and her husband Ian. As the Krankies they portray schoolboy Wee Jimmy Krankie (Janette), and paternal figure Ian Krankie (Ian), though in their comedy act they also portray other characters. Beginning in the 1990s, they regularly appeared as The Krankies in episodes of the BBC comedy series French and Saunders. \n Biographies \n Janette was born on 16 May 1947 in Queenzieburn, North Lanarkshire, Scotland, and Ian on 26 March 1947 in Glasgow, Scotland. The two met in 1966, and were married in 1969. \n Career \n They began their career as a comedy duo performing various characters, working the comedy circuit. In 1978 they got their \"big break\" when they were given a place at the Royal Variety Performance. \n Television \n During the 1980s they were given roles in several television shows, including the BBC's stalwart children's entertainment series Crackerjack. \n * Crackerjack (1980–1982) \n *The Krankies Klub  (1983–1984) \n *The Joke Machine (1985) \n *The Krankies Elektronik Komik  (1985–1987) \n *K.T.V  for Border Television (1989–1992) \n Music \n In early 1981 they released a couple of singles. \n * \"Fan - Dabi - Dozi\", their catchphrase, peaked at number 46 in the UK Singles Chart in February 1981.", "parametric_answer": "morecambe and wise", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

Well, not boring for me. \n From what I read, it’s not just a simple matter of sticking a record under a fancy microscope, as there is a lot of preparation (such as gold-sputtering the surface) and post-processing to be done.

Since the beginning of the phonograph , most records had played for about two or three minutes. Sometimes record companies issued longer recordings on large, 12-inch discs . But when the RCA Company began work on an improved disc in the mid-1940s, they stuck to the idea that a record should not have to hold more than one song. In order to make the disc smaller than the 10-inch, 78-rpm discs used since the 1890s, they reduced the speed to 45-rpm and used a much finer groove. This meant that they could pack in more grooves in a smaller space. They used a new plastic material, called vinylite, which resulted in the playing stylus picking up less noise and hiss. World War II interrupted this work, but the new 45-rpm disc and its player were introduced with great fanfare in late 1947. \n At about the same time, CBS Record Company (the successor to Columbia Phonograph Company established in the early days of the phonograph) introduced its 12-inch, 33 1/3-rpm, long playing record. The development of the LP dates back to 1945, and was the work of CBS research director Peter Goldmark and other engineers at CBS. It was also made of vinyl plastic, and had very fine grooves, but it was a different size and speed than the 45-rpm and could not be played on the same phonograph without modifications. The LP was not intended to hold short songs like the 45-rpm, but was for classical music, which often ran for 20 minutes or more without a break. \n Collection of Sun Records 45s \n Within a few years, however, most record companies had adopted both the LP and the 45-rpm formats, using the 45-rpm for singles and the LP for classical albums.

For the original song or the character, see Frosty the Snowman (song) or Frosty . \n Frosty the Snowman is an animated Christmas special that first aired on CBS on December 7, 1969. This special, written by Romeo Muller and produced and directed by Arthur Rankin and Jules Bass , is based on the holiday song of the same name , originally written by Jack Rollins and Steve Nelson and first performed by Gene Autry in the 1940s. This serves as Rankin/Bass 's second most prominent special to be aired on broadcast channels, behind Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer . \n Contents \n Synopsis \n SPOILER: Plot details or story follow. \n Professor Hinkle and the children are surprised to see that the hat has brought Frosty to life. \n One December afternoon, a school girl named Karen and her friends create a snowman after school. After several suggestions of what to call their snowman (including \"Oatmeal\" and \" Christopher Columbus \"), Karen decides to name him \"Frosty.\" They later acquire a top hat discarded by inept magician Professor Hinkle . When Karen places it on top of Frosty's head, the snowman comes to life (and always says \"Happy Birthday!\" in response). When Hinkle learns of the magic power his hat actually possesses, he takes it back and departs, pretending that he did not see Frosty come to life. However, the professor's pet rabbit, Hocus Pocus , returns the hat to Frosty. \n Frosty and the kids march to the train station. \n Frosty soon senses the temperature is rising and worries about melting. The children suggest putting him on the next train to the North Pole, where he will never melt, and they all parade into the city on the way to the train station, where Frosty has his confrontation with the traffic cop mentioned in the song's lyrics. When Karen explains that Frosty came to life and doesn't know what a traffic light or a lamp post is, the traffic cop lets Frosty go. At the train station, Frosty stows away aboard a refrigerated train car, since neither he nor the children have any money for a train ticket. As the train is about to leave the station, Karen and Hocus decide to join Frosty for the ride to keep him company. With that, Frosty, Karen, and Hocus wave goodbye to the other kids as the train takes off. Unbeknownst to them, Hinkle has also hitched a ride on the same train, intending to get his hat back. \n As the train continues up north, Frosty notices Karen is freezing, despite all her winter clothing, so they jump off the train, leaving Hinkle behind once again. Hinkle, seeing them escape, jumps off the train too, but falls down a mountain and crashes into a tree where a pile of snow falls on him and a squirrel laughs at him. At Frosty's request, Hocus convinces some forest animals that are preparing for Christmas to build a campfire for Karen. Fearing that Karen still cannot survive for long in the cold weather, Frosty asks Hocus who might be able to help them. Hocus suggests (by pantomiming) the President of the United States and the United States Marines, before suggesting Santa Claus. Frosty agrees, and promptly takes credit for the idea himself (much to Hocus' dismay). Hocus hops off to get Santa, but Hinkle then confronts Frosty and Karen once more and blows out Karen's campfire. Frosty and Karen are again forced to flee, this time with Karen riding on Frosty's back as he slides head-first down a hill. At the bottom of the slope, Karen and Frosty discover a greenhouse filled with Christmas poinsettias. Despite Karen's objections, Frosty steps inside the warm greenhouse with her, suggesting that he could afford to lose a little weight while she warms up. Unfortunately, Hinkle catches up to them immediately after and locks them in the greenhouse. \n Santa, having just revived Frosty, confronts Hinkle.", "parametric_answer": "professor hinkle", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

Shooting the Moon is a special strategy in which a player tries to take all 13 Hearts and the Queen of Spades. If you manage to Shoot the Moon you can either add 26 points to everyone’s score or subtract 26 from your own. \n Current “Shoot the Moon” Badges are: \n King of Hearts Badge (Weekly, May 16, 2012) \n Studmuffin Badge (Mix-n-Match, October 2007) \n Blue Moon Badge (Weekly, July 6, 2005) \n Lunar VIP Badge (Starter Album) \n These instructions are courtesy of Storm , who has been so helpful to so many of you in comments and the Q&A.  He’s volunteered his strategy for shooting the moon in Hearts in hopes it’ll help many more of you with your Hearts badges for months and years to come. \n Note: you can also follow these instructions by double-browsing instead of playing with a friend. \n How to Shoot the Moon in Pogo Hearts \n Here is a strategy guide in helping to “Shoot the Moon” in Hearts. This method is played with a friend sat opposite you.  These instructions are not a guarantee but this strategy will help you shoot the moon, if you and your friend are lucky enough to be dealt hands that can support you taking all of the hearts and the Queen of Spades. \n Make sure to have your table set to the options below. Also have it set to private so you are not disturbed. \n Basic table set-up: \n Advanced options: \n To begin with you will need to pass 3 cards to the person sat opposite you.  Ideally you should work together and have them pass the highest hearts they have – this can include the Queen of Spades. \n For this method to work, you will need to have or be passed the Ace of Hearts, plus either the King or Queen of Hearts. Also having 1 or 2 of the Ace, King or Queen of Spades would be an advantage. \n Try to have between 5 – 7 heart cards after the initial pass. If you have anything lower than that, exit and restart. This will ensure you have the maximum possibility of shooting the moon. \n Your cards should mainly be highly ranked cards, this will make it easier to keep control of the game. \n The player who has the 2 of clubs plays first – play continues clockwise. Try and trump the highest card to take control of the next hand. Play the higher ranked clubs and diamonds to gain control. \n Next pass the player opposite you the lower ranked cards – ones in the Clubs and Diamond suits as these will not help you take control of the hands. \n If you have the Queen of Spades, play this next. (The robots will not play the King of Spades as the idea of the game is to take the lowest amount of points). This will give you 13 points. \n If you don’t have the Queen of Spades, play either the King or Ace of Spades – either robot will play the Queen of Spades, so you will end up taking the 13 points. \n Avoid playing the lower hearts once the Queen of Spades is played (broken), as the robots will try to take the tricks to avoid you shooting the moon. \n Start with the Ace of Hearts, but make sure the King of Hearts is played – if you don’t already have it. Ideally you need to “flush” out the higher hearts from the robots. \n Then play the Queen of Hearts, Jack etc. It should ideally only take 4 or 5 hands to have taken all of the hearts. Once all hearts have been played you will have 26 points. \n Keep count! There are only 13 heart cards to take – this will ensure you shoot the moon.", "parametric_answer": "bridge", "parametric_answer_freq": 5}

{"question": "Rickets is caused by a lack of what essential element?", "answers": ["calcium"], "context": "Rickets: Causes, Symptoms and Treatments - Health NewsRickets: Causes, Symptoms and Treatments - Medical News Today \n Rickets: Causes, Symptoms and Treatments \n Written by Stephanie Brunner B.A. \n 4 16 \n Rickets is a childhood bone disorder in which bones soften and become prone to fractures and deformity. Although rare in industrialized nations, it is still fairly common in some developing countries. \n The main cause of rickets is a lack of vitamin D . Not having enough calcium in one's diet may also be a cause of rickets, as may vomiting and diarrhea .  Some childhood kidney and liver diseases can cause rickets, as may a digestive disorder complication that affects calcium and phosphorous absorption. \n Rickets affects mainly children, although the disorder may also affect adults (osteomalacia). In most cases, the child suffers from severe and long-term malnutrition , usually during early childhood. \n The term rickets comes from the Old English word \"wrickken\", meaning to twist or bend. Rickets was common in the UK and USA during the 19th century. \n For proper absorption of calcium and phosphorous from the gut, we need vitamin D. If vitamin D levels in a child are low, he/she may have inadequate calcium and phosphorous bone levels. A study published in JAMA in 2013 suggested that babies should be given a daily dose of vitamin D of 400 IU (international units) to help them stay healthy . \n Providing a child with extra vitamin D and some minerals usually resolves the rickets problem. \n Symptoms of rickets \n A symptom is something the patient feels and reports, while a sign is something other people, such as the doctor detect. For example, pain may be a symptom while a rash may be a sign. \n Symptoms of rickets may include: \n Baby is floppy \n Causes of rickets \n Some of the conditions that can be caused by vitamin D deficiency. \n Lack of vitamin D - the main cause of rickets. Our bodies need vitamin D in order to absorb calcium from the intestines. Ultraviolet light (from sunlight)  helps our skin cells convert vitamin D from an inactive into an active state. \n If we do not have enough vitamin D, calcium that we get from the food we eat is not absorbed properly, causing hypocalcemia (lower-than-normal blood calcium) to develop. Hypocalcemia results in deformities of bones and teeth, as well as neuromuscular problems. \n The following foods are known to be rich on vitamin D: eggs, fish oils , margarine, some fortified milks and juices, some oily fishes, and some soymilk products that have vitamin D added. \n Genetic defect - hypophosphatemic rickets is a rare genetic fault that undermines the way the kidneys process phosphates. Phosphate blood levels are too low, leading to weak and soft bones. \n Some diseases - some renal (kidney), hepatic (liver) and intestinal diseases can interfere with the way the body absorbs and metabolizes minerals and vitamins, resulting in rickets. \n Risk factors for rickets \n Vitamin D is described as the sunshine vitamin. A study published in the journal Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapeutics in 2012 suggested that 50% of the worldwide population may be deficient in vitamin D ( source ). \n A risk factor is something which increases the likelihood of developing a condition or disease. For example, obesity significantly raises the risk of developing diabetes type 2. Therefore, obesity is a risk factor for diabetes type 2. \n Risk factors for rickets include: \n Poverty - rickets is more likely to occur among children who are poor. \n Sunlight - children who do not get enough sunlight are more dependent on excellent nutrition to make sure they are getting enough vitamin D. \n Malnutrition - rickets is more common in areas of the world where severe droughts and starvation occur. \n On the next page we look at the diagnosis of rickets, complications caused by the condition and the available treatments for rickets.

{"question": "What product demanded you “Obey your thirst”?", "answers": ["sprite"], "context": "Obey Your Thirst - University of Wisconsin–MadisonObey Your Thirst \n The article below is a work of fiction of unknown origin. The actual     Obey Your Thirst campaign was indeed created by the advertising agency     Lowe and Partners (in 1993), headed by Chairman and Chief Creative Officer     of the agency Lee Garfinkel along with the Creative Directors C.J. Waldman     and Todd Godwin; their inspiration for this brilliant campaign is     unknown. The client for the Coca Cola company was Sergio Zemen. \n Oct 1, 1997 \n Ever heard that catchy slogan for Sprite? \n \"Image is nothing. \n Thirst is everything. \n Obey your thirst.\" \n In the summer of 1996, Coca-Cola, who manufactures Sprite products, was looking to change the image of its sparkling soda. Sales were down.  The old campaign of \"I like the Sprite in you!\" was growing long in the tooth, and worse, wasn't catching on with the growing \"Generation X\" crowd.  \"We were looking for something hip, something fresh, something that would appeal to the younger generation,\" stated Coke spokesman Bob Bertini. \n So Sprite contacted Lowe & Partners/SMS, a New York based advertising agency known for its ability to appeal to the younger masses (Lowe also handles the entire Reebok campaign). After just one week, a surprisingly short turn-around for a campaign of this proportion, a series of TV and radio advertisements based on the \"obey your thirst\" motto was proposed, and accepted with enthusiasm by the marketing team at Coca-Cola. \n As far as advertising goes, it was a smash success.  Sales have increased roughly 9% since the introduction, especially in the younger age groups.  When rating the advertisements, ninety-three percent of consumers ages 18-24 said they were effective. Among all consumers who knew the ads, 83% said the same. \n The campaign was the brain child of advertising executive Donald Rifkin, a long-time employee of Lowe & Partners. His inspiration for the slogan came from an old political speech he had run across in his free time. \"I just love looking through artifacts of political history. I chanced across this one particular speech, and the speaker made an aside about thirst that absolutely just stuck in my head. I felt that I could use it somewhere, so I jotted it down. A month later, when Sprite came calling, the match almost seemed too easy.\" \n In 1971, former President Ronald Reagan, then the Governor of California, was addressing a gathering of the Boy Scouts of America on a particularly scorching Southern California day. As he neared conclusion, Reagan paused briefly to take a sip of water. Noticeably refreshed, upon returning to the microphone, he told the audience, \"Now, I certainly have spoken on a number of different topics today.

The father of basketball was a high school dropout who eventually earned four college degrees. Dr. James A. Naismith was a modest man who neither sought publicity nor engaged in self-promotion. He was a remarkably versatile and humble man who in 1891 invented a game that is now played by more people than any game in the world. \n It’s doubtful that even Naismith’s creative mind could have envisioned his game’s vast global popularity little more than a century later, or a National Basketball Association consisting of 30 teams spanning North America. All he was seeking was an indoor activity that would provide an outlet for sometimes-unruly students during the long, cold New England winters. \n In late 1891, Dr. Luther Halsey Gulick Jr., the superintendent of physical education at the International YMCA Training School (now Springfield College) in Springfield, Mass., challenged Naismith to create a new indoor game “that would be interesting, easy to learn, and easy to play in the winter and by artificial light.” Naismith reflected on popular games of the day (baseball, football, lacrosse, rugby and soccer) and the games from his childhood (duck on a rock), and assembled the pieces that would become Basket Ball. It would be 30 years before it would be shortened to one word. \n Naismith had the school janitor, Pop Stebbins, nail two peach baskets to the lower rail of the gymnasium balcony, one at each end, while the secretary, Mrs. Lyons, typed the original 13 rules. Then he nervously awaited his students’ arrival. \n “There were 18 in the class,” Naismith said years later. “I selected two captains and had them choose sides. I placed the men on the floor. There were three forwards, three centers and three backs on each team. I chose two of the center men to jump, then threw the ball between them. It was the start of the first basketball game and the finish of trouble with that class.” (See article on The First Team.) \n The game was an immediate success. On December 21, 1891 the students played the entire class period and finished the game with a 1-0 score. Within a few weeks, basketball quickly spread on campus by word of mouth and across the United States through the YMCA network. \n Hoopedia: Herkimer YMCA \n Herkimer YMCA, from Herkimer, New York, was an early pioneer in basketball and a catalyst for the development of basketball in the state. The team is of interest in terms of historiography based on a claim in a memoirs of an old time basketball player that it was at Herkimer where basketball was invented and where the first formal game was played. \n The Herkimer YMCA basketball team was reputedly founded by Lambert Will in the fall of 1891, according to a Utica Daily Press story from February 19, 1998. The team’s earliest photo supposedly dates from the 1891-92 season, and the story of the Herkimer team was presented by Frank J. Basloe in his 1952 book, I Grew Up with Basketball. In the book he makes the claim that basketball was invented at the Herkimer YMCA and the first formal game was played in February of 1891 between Herkimer YMCA and the Businessmen’s Nine. The author claims that Will “wrote down all the rules that he and boys had developed and sent them to James Naismith at Springfield.” These claims have never been accepted by any historian of basketball. \n Basloe is on no firmer ground in reporting that during the 1891-92 season other upstate New York teams took up the sport, notably Albany YMCA, Utica YMCA, and Ilion YMCA. In February 1892, Herkimer YMCA played Albany YMCA for the self-designated, “Basketball Championship of New York State.” Playing for the Herkimer team were", "parametric_answer": "ice hockey", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

On March.26, 1977 the program officially changed its name to Saturday Night Live. \n Currently in its 35th season, this weekly 90 minute sketch comedy program,  based out of New York City, is renown for not only featuring a famous thespian host- promoting his or her's latest feature film while taking part in most of the comedic vignettes- but also interweaving musical guests who perform twice throughout the show's duration, providing a \"take five\" break for both jesters and audience members from the precipitous outpour of laugh aloud segments. \n SNL's longevity can be attributed to a dominant topicality factor pulsing within its satirical formula. Honing further into the parody equation is a specific fraction which exemplifies characters and impersonations amicably linked to the popular music stratosphere of the late 20th century- originally implemented by the hip, fresh, \"not ready for prime time players\" cast of 75-80'. \n During SNL's first five years, viewers delighted over the antics of acts such as-yet certainly not limited to- frequent host Steve Martin-with backing band The Toot Uncommons- belting out a hit parading, zinger-of-an-ode to the immortally famous Egyptian pharaoh King Tut; Gilda Radner fantastically mirroring the visceral energy of punk poet Patti Smith; Bill Murray hamming it up as Star Wars singing lounge crooner Nick Winters; and John Belushi impeccably impersonating Joe Cocker circa 69' or re-imagining Ludwig Van Beethoven , while in Vienna in the early 1800's, as a Motown inclined composing artist. \n In 1978, SNL struck gold when debuting The Blues Brothers. \n The sharply attired-three piece suited, dark sunglasses and fedora wearing-outfit featured fictional siblings Jake (John Belushi) and Elwood (Dan Ackroyd), impressively executing a 50's and 60's R & b/ soul revivalist revue of rollicking good time gems. \n Two years later a motion picture film titled simply The Blues Brothers- directed by John \"National Lampoons Animal House and Thriller of the night\" Landis-was projected universally across innumerable cinema screens. \n Since its inception, The Blues Brother's rollicking, \"we're on a mission from God\", celluloid journey has remained an internationally hailed cult classic amongst countless film connoisseurs. \n While Belushi and Ackroyd masqueraded as styling, swaggering, successful Soul Men, the remaining members of the original 75-80' vaudevillian ensemble and founding producer Lorne Michaels, were reported as having had creative differences with the mighty powers holding court at NBC-thus prompting all parties to end their affiliation with Saturday Night Live in the Spring of 1980 (Michaels returned as executive producer in 1985 and has remained in the position since). \n In the autumn of 1980-without altering the musical guest portion of the program- SNL introduced an entirely new variegated troupe. \n Public opinion polls state that the 80-81' SNL season was the weakest point of an otherwise critically and publicly acclaimed program. \n Nevertheless, the popular music quality of SNL shone on and -from 80-84'- a bright light was primarily focused on the revitalizing energy of Eddie Murphy, who continued the course of utilizing the popular music medium as a rich source for unbridled farce. \n The Brooklyn born comic's incandescent wit triggered and prevailed in provoking bursts of gut blasting laughter from the wide mass of spectating throngs. \n Among his musical repertoire were hilarious impersonations of James Brown hosting a Celebrity Hot Tub special; as Stevie Wonder jamming out with an equally amusing Joe Piscopo- aptly conjuring the spirit of Frank \"ol' blue eyes\" Sinatra- on Ebony & Ivory; and as the unforgettable Tyrone Green and his reggae band-a rasta singing send up on the legendary Bob Marley And The Wailers- performing an ease-filled,", "parametric_answer": "joe piscopo", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

She is featured as main character Daffy Duck 's blonde girlfriend in several cartoon shorts but is only referred to as Melissa in one, The Scarlet Pumpernickel , where she is voiced by Bea Benaderet . \n Character history \n Edit \n Melissa Duck's most notable role is that from the series Baby Looney Tunes, which casts the adult characters from the original Looney Tunes theatrical shorts as their infant selves. Melissa had a crush on Daffy Duck ever since she was an infant. However, unlike well-known male characters such as Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, female characters were rare in the original shorts; with Melissa Duck, Petunia Pig and the Tasmanian She-Devil only making a couple appearances each, whilst Baby Looney Tunes character Lola Bunny was created for the 1996 movie Space Jam . In Baby Looney Tunes, Melissa, a yellow duckling with darker hair than her adult self, acts as a comedian and enjoys making her friends laugh, even though her humor sometimes gets her into trouble. She is voiced there by Janyse Jaud . \n Melissa Duck appeared in adult form in the original Looney Tunes short Chuck Jones 's The Scarlet Pumpernickel (1950) which was, in 1994, voted number 31 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field. [1 ] In the cartoon, she appears as a blonde damsel-in-distress and Daffy Duck's love interest. The plot followed Daffy attempting to save Fair Lady Melissa from having to marry the evil Grand Duke Sylvester with whom she is not in love. She also appeared in the American animated television series Duck Dodgers as a lady (voiced by June Foray ), alongside Petunia Pig (also voiced by June Foray). \n Later in Robert McKimson 's Muscle Tussle (1953), Daffy Duck's girlfriend appears with him on a visit to the beach. The girlfriend's design in this cartoon is markedly more stylized than Melissa's appearance in The Scarlet Pumpernickel, but a contemporary comics adaptation of Muscle Tussle carried the name Melissa on to this new design as well. \n One could argue that the character actually predated both Tussle and Pumpernickel. In the 1945 cartoon Nasty Quacks , Daffy's owner, a young girl, also becomes the besotted owner of a small, yellow duckling. When a jealous Daffy feeds the duckling growth pills, he is surprised to see it age into a white, female duck with blonde hair. By the end of the cartoon, the two have fallen in love and given birth to roughly ten black, white and yellow ducklings of their own. The blonde duck in this cartoon bears visual similarities to Daffy's girlfriend from Muscle Tussle (as well as a vague resemblance to the female pigeon Hatta Mari from Plane Daffy , 1944) and as such could be theorized to represent the \"origin\" of the Melissa Duck character. \n Another blonde, female duck featured in the Greg Ford and Terry Lennon 1987 cartoon The Duxorcist , the first Looney Tunes short released to theaters after the original series ended in 1969. A loose parody of William Friedkin's The Exorcist , the cartoon depicts the single, young duck as having become possessed by ghosts. The task of banishing the spirits falls to ghost-hunter Daffy Duck resulting in the pair falling in love as soon as they set their eyes on one another. They exchange two long kisses, one on the couch and another when she wraps her arms around him to congratulate Daffy for removing the ghosts from her body. As the ghosts chase him away, in a southern accent she says to Daffy \"Y'all come back now ya hear!\" Despite having paler feathers, the female duck from this cartoon physically appears very similar to Melissa from The Scarlet Pumpernickel; even more so than the designs in Muscle Tussle and Nasty Quacks.", "parametric_answer": "honey", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

{"question": "The Princeton Review just released their list of the top 371 colleges and universities in the US. What Big Ten school was ranked the #1 party school?", "answers": ["pennsylvania state university"], "context": "Big Ten ConferenceThe Big Ten Conference (B1G), formerly Western Conference and Big Nine Conference, is the oldest Division I collegiate athletic conference in the United States. The conference competes in the NCAA Division I; its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), formerly known as Division I-A, the highest level of NCAA competition in that sport. The conference includes the flagship public university in each of 11 states stretching from New Jersey to Nebraska, as well as two additional public land grant schools and a private university. \n The Big Ten Conference was established in 1895 when Purdue University president James H. Smart and representatives from the University of Chicago, University of Illinois, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University, and University of Wisconsin gathered at the Palmer House Hotel in Chicago to set policies aimed at regulating intercollegiate athletics. In 1905, the conference was officially incorporated as the \"Intercollegiate Conference Athletic Association\".  The conference uses the \"B1G\" character combination in its branding, noting that it \"allows fans to see 'BIG' and '10' in a single word.\"  \n Big Ten member institutions are predominantly major flagship research universities that have large financial endowments and are well-regarded academically. Large student enrollment is also a hallmark of Big Ten universities, as 12 of the 14 members feature enrollments of 30,000 or more students. Northwestern University, one of just two full members with a total enrollment of fewer than 30,000 students (the other is the University of Nebraska–Lincoln), is the lone private university among Big Ten membership. Collectively, Big Ten universities educate more than 520,000 total students and have 5.7 million living alumni.  Big Ten universities engage in $9.3 billion in funded research each year.  Though the Big Ten existed for nearly a century as an assemblage of universities located primarily in the Midwest, the conference now has a geographic footprint which spans from the state of Nebraska in the west to the Atlantic Ocean in the east. \n Big Ten universities are also members of the Big Ten Academic Alliance, a leading academic consortium. In 2014–2015, members generated more than $10 billion in research expenditures.  Eleven of the conference's 13 public universities are considered \"Public Ivies\", publicly funded universities considered comparable to the quality of education at an Ivy League institution.   Despite the conference's name, the Big Ten has grown to fourteen members, with the following universities accepting invitations to join: Pennsylvania State University in 1990, the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in 2011, and both the University of Maryland and Rutgers University in 2014. Johns Hopkins University was invited in 2012 to join the Big Ten as an associate member participating in men's lacrosse only. In 2015, it was also accepted as an associate member in women's lacrosse.

Advertising Age magazine lists the slogan among the top 10 of all time - not bad. \n There is a direct corollary between this slogan and investment decisions. Many investors want their investments to taste great, to provide premium returns, but be less filing, not have much risk. Most of the packaged investment products sold by brokers follow this time-tested maxim. \n The problem is risk and return are related to one another. The reason many investors want to finesse this point is simple: fear. They fear they will lose money in the market. They fear things are different now than they were in the past. They fear all the unknown and the unknowables.  Fear is perhaps our most innate and adaptable human emotion and it can destroy an otherwise sound financial plan all by itself, if you allow it. \n Our role as real financial advisors is to provide clients with 100% honesty. That alone makes us different than other firms. The traditional financial services firm thrives on a \"tastes great, less filling\" concept because it deludes people into thinking that these firms are acting in their best interest when in reality they are not.  We help clients develop a real financial plan based on what matters most to them all from an unconflicted perspective. \n Many if not most of the otherwise successful individuals today suffer from some form of financial sickness. That is, they have bought the \"tastes great, less filling\" narrative and it has served them poorly. In many instances, they arrive in our office in their 50s or 60s mortally ill from a financial planing perspective. The path many have followed has not fostered financial security but instead it's perched them on the cliffs of financial ruin. They are in real danger of out-living their resources and need a totally different approach. \n We offer a cure.  No, not a quick packaged investment solution that promises better performance, but instead a goals focused perspective. You see better performance isn't a real goal; not out-living your financial resources is a real goal. \n \"Tastes great, less filling\" - it's a great slogan for a beer, but not much of a strategy for investing. \n Ready for a real conversation? \n Category", "parametric_answer": "miller lite", "parametric_answer_freq": 3}

Spike is a general entertainment channel featuring a mix of various programs and movies, primarily oriented towards a male audience. \n Spike's programming reaches approximately 98.7 million pay television subscribers in the United States   as well as Canada. As of 2006, Spike's viewers were almost half women (45%), although many of them are reported to be watching it with male partners or family members, or were watching the CSI franchise.  The average age of the channel's viewers was 42 years old. \n As of February 2015, approximately 93.4 million households in the U.S. (80% of those with television) receive Spike.  \n Precursors \n The Nashville Network era (1983–2000) \n Spike was launched on March 7, 1983 as The Nashville Network, a country living and country music-themed television channel that originally operated as a joint venture of WSM, Inc. (a subsidiary of National Life and Accident Insurance Company) and Group W Satellite Communications. TNN operated from the now-defunct Opryland USA theme park near Nashville, Tennessee. Country Music Television (CMT), founded by Glenn D. Daniels, beat TNN's launch by two days, robbing them of the claim of the \"first country music cable television network.\" TNN's flagship shows included Nashville Now, The Statler Brothers Show, American Sports Cavalcade and Grand Ole Opry Live. Nashville Now and the Grand Ole Opry were broadcast live from Opryland USA.   \n The Gaylord Entertainment Company purchased TNN and the Opryland properties in the latter half of 1987. Much of TNN's programming (except for its sports) during the Gaylord era was originally produced by Opryland Productions, also owned by Gaylord Entertainment.  From 1983 to 1992, all of TNN's auto racing and motor sports coverage was produced by Diamond P Sports. Starting in 1993, TNN started having its NASCAR coverage produced by World Sports Enterprises, and the American Speed Association coverage produced by Group 5 Sports, while Diamond P continued to produce most of the rest of the racing coverage. Programming included variety shows, talk shows, game shows, outdoor shows (such as hunting and fishing), and lifestyle shows; all centered in some way around country music or the country style of living.  \n Some of TNN's popular on-air talent included local Nashville media personalities Ralph Emery,  Dan Miller, Charlie Chase and Lorianne Crook, as well as established stars such as country music singer Bill Anderson and actresses Florence Henderson and Dinah Shore. By 1995, TNN was acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which had recently acquired CBS around that time; two years later, Westinghouse bought CMT, TNN's chief competitor. In 1998, the channel dropped its \"The Nashville Network\" moniker and shortened its official name to TNN. Ownership shifted to Viacom in the late 1990s after its acquisition of CBS Corporation, Westinghouse's successor.  TNN subsequently relocated its headquarters to New York City from Nashville and was folded into Viacom's MTV Networks division. \n The National Network, the New TNN and the WWE era (2000–03) \n On September 25, 2000, Viacom, sensing redundancy among TNN and CMT when it merged them into its MTV Networks unit, decided to refocus TNN, and in the process, the channel dramatically scaled back its country-western programs and changed its name to The National Network.  The network's name change also triggered a significant programming change in an attempt to appeal to a broader audience than the channel's original rural/working-class Southern demographic. This change was catalyzed by Viacom's acquisition of the rights to World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE) programming, including its flagship show RAW Is War. This was likely an attempt to compete with Universal's USA Network which Viacom (through Paramount) had briefly owned a stake in during the mid-1990s.

The northern part is in the borough of Camden and the southern part in the City of Westminster. It took its start from the west end of Wych Street, redeveloped in the later 19th century as Aldwych. The lane led to the house built by Sir William Drury, Knight of the Garter in Queen Elizabeth's reign. Drury House, with a coachyard in front and a garden in back, was a scene of the intrigues that led to the ill-fated rebellion of the Queen's favourite, the Earl of Essex. In the 17th century it was the London house of the Earl of Craven, then a public house under the sign of his reputed mistress, the Queen of Bohemia, but by the 18th century Drury Lane had become one of the worst slums in London, dominated by prostitution and gin palaces. The area was eventually cleared to make way for the developments of Kingsway and Aldwych. The name of the street is often used to refer to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, which has in different incarnations been located in Drury Lane since the 17th century. Also in Drury Lane is the New London Theatre. The street Drury Lane is also where The Muffin Man lives as mentioned in the popular nursery rhyme. It is not known whether the song refers to Drury Lane in London or another town.

The rhyme was first recorded in around 1820 with lyrics very similar to those used today; sometimes it is sung using Mulberry lane instead of Drury Lane. \n Drury Lane is the name of a street located in London's Theatreland There are many traditional songs that have been set according to the lyrics of this song with regional variations in wording. \n The Muffin Man would deliver muffins door-to-door or sell them in the street; the muffins were the English bread product called English muffins and not the sweeter cupcake American variety. \n One of the many stories associated with this is :Originally eaten by the \"downstairs\" servants in England's Victorian society, the English muffin surfaced and rose to prominence in Great Britain when members of all classes of society became aware of its goodness. The family baker made English muffins from leftover bread and biscuit dough scraps and mashed potatoes. He fried the batter on a hot griddle, creating light, crusty muffins for the servants. Once members of the \"upstairs\" family tasted these rich muffins, they began to request them for themselves - especially during teatime. \n As a result of the English muffin becoming the \"most fancied\" bread on the isle, English muffin factories sprang up all over England. Muffin men could be heard in the streets selling their muffins from wooden trays slung around their necks. For teatime in private homes and clubs, the English muffins would be split and toasted over an open fire and served in a covered sterling dish alongside tea. The prominence of the muffin men in English society was evident when \"Oh, do you know the muffin man\" became a popular children nursery rhyme.

Instead of spinning records, Constantine chose a different path in order to serve the public.

He recounts growing up with classmates of Japanese and Chinese ancestry. \n Life as a Husky \n After graduating high school in 1980, Constantine attended the University of Washington. “I never really applied anywhere else,” Constantine said. “From a very early age, I wanted to be a husky.” He is from a long line of huskies in his families. \n Constantine majored in political science. In the early 1980s, he dabbled as a disc jockey for the campus radio station, KCMU (now KEXP). Constantine began by volunteering at the radio station until he was offered a shift. “I started off with the 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. slot,” Constantine said, laughing. He eventually worked his way to a popular Friday afternoon slot. “I had a lot of fun, and it was one of the best times in college,” said Constantine. \n Not only did Constantine play music, he met fellow student and longtime girlfriend Shirley Carlson. Carlson, who is half Japanese, was a disc jockey and the music director at KCMU. \n After graduating in 1985, Constantine went to law school at the University of Washington. Upon completion of his law degree in 1990, Constantine received a master’s degree in urban planning. “I wanted to broaden my education and broaden my horizons,” Constantine said. “I have always been interested in the development of the city and [the master’s program] gave me the chance to study it more closely.” \n Professional Life \n In 1992, Constantine began practicing law after receiving his master’s degree. He specialized in small businesses, land use, and real estate matters. “I found the best part of practicing was helping to take a [client’s] idea and make it a reality,” said Constantine. In 1996, Constantine began working on an open space preservation project in West Seattle. The main issue was protecting a wooded ravine from development, which was near his childhood home. During this time, he met Charlie Chong, a longtime Seattle political activist and fellow West Seattle resident. He became more involved with the Democratic Party, which led to Constantine running and winning a seat as a state representative in 1996. \n Constantine was re-elected as a state representative in 1998 and became a state senator in 2000. \n In 2002, Constantine was appointed to the King County Council where he served until his election for the vacant King County Executive position this year. \n Through his political career, Constantine has kept great contacts with diverse ethnic communities. “It’s critical to directly address and be engaged with ethnic communities across the county,” said Constantine. \n “He has a sincere sense of civic responsibility,” said Hyeok Kim, executive director of the InterIm Community Development Association.

{"question": "What company advertised itself with the slogan “We’ll leave a light on for you”?", "answers": ["motel 6", "motel6", "studio 6"], "context": "Motel 6Motel 6 is a major chain of budget motels with more than 1,100 locations in the United States and Canada. Motel 6 also operates Studio 6, a chain of extended stay hotels. In October 2012, the sale of the Motel 6 chain by Accor Hotels to The Blackstone Group for $1.9 billion was concluded. The Blackstone Group then established G6 Hospitality LLC as the management company for Motel 6 and Studio 6. \n History \n Motel 6 was founded in Santa Barbara, California, in 1962, by two local building contractors, William Becker and Paul Greene.   The partners developed a plan to build motels with rooms at bargain rates. They decided on a $6.00 room rate per night (equivalent to $ in ) that would cover building costs, land leases, and janitorial supplies; hence the company name \"Motel 6\".  \n Becker and Greene had specialized in building low-cost housing developments,  and they wanted to provide an alternative to other major hotel chains, such as Holiday Inn, whose locations were becoming increasingly upscale in quality and price in the 1960s, after starting out with a budget-oriented concept. Becker and Greene spent two years formulating their business model, and searched for ways to cut costs as much as possible. During the chain's early years, Motel 6 emphasized itself as a \"no-frills\" lodging chain with rooms featuring coin-operated black-and-white television receivers instead of the free color televisions found in the more expensive motels, along with functional interior decor, to reduce the time it took to clean the rooms. The first location in Santa Barbara had no restaurant on-site, a notable difference from other hotels of the era; most locations to this day have no on-site dining, though there is usually a choice of restaurants nearby. \n As the 1960s progressed, the Motel 6 idea became very popular in the lodging industry and other chains began to imitate the concept, as Motel 6 was slowly beginning to take a small share of the market away from the traditional hotels. In 1965 Motel 6 opened its 15th property, and first location outside of California, in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah. Realizing the need to move quickly, Becker and Green set out on an ambitious expansion program and had opened its 25th location in Gilroy, California, by 1966. The occupancy rate by then was about 85 percent, well above the industry average, and as a result of their success, Motel 6 became an attractive acquisition target. Becker and Greene sold the chain to an investment group in 1968. \n In the early 1970s Motel 6 opened its largest location, Motel 6 Tropicana, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Additionally, the chain moved east and opened a location in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1972. By 1980 Motel 6 had reached 300 locations. It was sold to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 1985, who moved the chain away from its \"no frills\" approach and began including amenities such as telephones and color television. \n Market share declined throughout the 1980s, in part because of increased competition from other budget hotels. During this time span, it bought out the Sixpence Inn chain in the western U.S., and Envoy Inn (formerly Bargaintel)  in the Midwestern United States and Pennsylvania.  Regal 8 Motels were acquired in 1991. In 1990, the company was bought by the French-based Accor. In 1993, they opened their first high-rise location — Motel 6 LAX in Los Angeles, California. \n Unlike the majority of motel chains, Motel 6 allows pets, and directly owns and operates most of its locations. However, in order to expand more rapidly outside of its traditional Western United States base, the chain did start franchising in 1994. Franchised locations may charge extra for Wi-Fi access. Accor management also took over motels that had previously been franchised by other chains. Motel 6 also began to renovate all bedrooms, sold off under-performing locations, and upgraded door locks and other security measures. Motel 6 locations generally do not include alarm clocks or facial tissues, however. Newer properties, as well as acquisitions,", "parametric_answer": "holiday inn", "parametric_answer_freq": 4}

There, you can easily access this resource later when you’re ready to customize it or assign it to your students. \n Connective Tissues: Loose, Fibrous, and Cartilage \n Connective tissue is found throughout the body, providing support and shock absorption for tissues and bones. \n Learning Objective \n Distinguish between the different types of connective tissue \n Key Points \n Fibroblasts are cells that generate any connective tissue that the body needs, as they can move throughout the body and can undergo mitosis to create new tissues. \n Protein fibers run throughout connective tissue, providing stability and support; they can be either collagen , elastic, or reticular fibers. \n Loose connective tissue is not particularly tough, but surrounds blood vessels and provides support to internal organs. \n Fibrous connective tissue, which is composed of parallel bundles of collagen fibers, is found in the dermis, tendons, and ligaments. \n Hyaline cartilage forms the skeleton of the embryo before it is transformed into bone; it is found in the adult body at the tip of the nose and around the ends of the long bones, where it prevents friction at the joints. \n Fibrocartilage is the strongest of the connective tissues; it is found in regions of the body that experience large amounts of stress and require a high degree of shock absorption, such as between the vertebrae. \n Terms \n Full Text \n Connective Tissues \n Connective tissues are composed of a matrix consisting of living cells and a non-living substance, called the ground substance. The ground substance is composed of an organic substance (usually a protein) and an inorganic substance (usually a mineral or water). The principal cell of connective tissues is the fibroblast, an immature connective tissue cell that has not yet differentiated. This cell makes the fibers found in nearly all of the connective tissues. Fibroblasts are motile , able to carry out mitosis, and can synthesize whichever connective tissue is needed. Macrophages , lymphocytes , and, occasionally, leukocytes can be found in some of the tissues, while others may have specialized cells. The matrix in connective tissues gives the tissue its density . When a connective tissue has a high concentration of cells or fibers, it has a proportionally-less-dense matrix. \n The organic portion, or protein fibers, found in connective tissues are either collagen, elastic, or reticular fibers. Collagen fibers provide strength to the tissue, preventing it from being torn or separated from the surrounding tissues. Elastic fibers are made of the protein elastin; this fiber can stretch to one and one half of its length, returning to its original size and shape. Elastic fibers provide flexibility to the tissues. Reticular fibers, the third type of protein fiber found in connective tissues, consist of thin strands of collagen that form a network of fibers to support the tissue and other organs to which it is connected. \n Loose (Areolar) Connective Tissue \n Loose connective tissue, also called areolar connective tissue, has a sampling of all of the components of a connective tissue. Loose connective tissue has some fibroblasts, although macrophages are present as well. Collagen fibers are relatively wide and stain a light pink, while elastic fibers are thin and stain dark blue to black . The space between the formed elements of the tissue is filled with the matrix. The material in the connective tissue gives it a loose consistency similar to a cotton ball that has been pulled apart. Loose connective tissue is found around every blood vessel, helping to keep the vessel in place. The tissue is also found around and between most body organs. In summary, areolar tissue is tough, yet flexible, and comprises membranes.

{"question": "In what outdoor sport, sanctioned by the NHPA, do you score 3 points for a ringer, 2 for a leaner, and the closet scores a point?", "answers": ["horseshoes"], "context": "HorseshoesHorseshoes is an outdoor game played between two people (or two teams of two people) using four horseshoes and two throwing targets (stakes) set in a sandbox area. The game is played by the players alternating turns tossing horseshoes at stakes in the ground,  which are traditionally placed 40 ft apart. Modern games use a more stylized U-shaped bar, about twice the size of an actual horseshoe. \n Game play  \n Official Rules of the Game of Horseshoes from the NHPA  \n The National Horseshoe Pitchers Association (NHPA), the recognized governing body of the sport of horseshoe pitching in the United States, maintains an up-to-date set of rules, guidelines and specifications for the game on their website.  Widely accepted as being the official way to play the game, they outline the style of play, the two most common scoring methods (cancellation and count-all), acceptable equipment, and exact court specifications as well as additional methods of organizing tournament and league competitions. \n There are other entities that have their own versions of the game and sanction their own events, but the largest recognized volume of sanctioned tournaments and leagues (by far)  are those of the NHPA. \n BOH Cup style of play  \n The game begins with a horseshoe toss to decide who goes first. The winner of the toss throws both horseshoes—one at a time—at the opposite stake, and then the second player throws both of their horseshoes—again, one at a time—at their end. After scoring, the next round is done in reverse order, or by throwing back at the original stake. Play continues until one player has at least 15 points at the end of a round. NHPA sanctioned games are generally played to 40 points, or a shoe limit of 40 or 50 shoes. The horseshoes can be made of either plastic or metal. \n Scoring  \n In horseshoes, there are two ways to score: by throwing \"ringers\" or by throwing the horseshoe nearest to the stake. A ringer is a thrown horseshoe such that the horseshoe completely encircles the stake. Disputes are settled by using a straightedge to touch the two points at the ends of the horseshoe, called \"heel calks\". If the straightedge doesn't touch the stake, then the horseshoe is a ringer. \n One player pitches both shoes in succession to one pit, followed by the other player.  This is formally called an inning.  Normally only one pitcher can score points per inning, however some leagues and tournaments play \"count all\", in which all points in each inning are counted.  A live shoe that is not a ringer, but comes to rest six inches (6”) or closer to the stake, has a value of one (1) point. This includes a “leaner”.  If both of one player's horseshoes are closer than the opponent's, two points are scored. A ringer scores three points.  In the case of one ringer and a closer horseshoe, both horseshoes are scored for a total of four points. If a player throws two ringers, that player scores six points. If each player throws a ringer, the ringers cancel and no points are scored.  If two ringers are thrown by one player and one ringer by the opponent, the player throwing two ringers scores three points.  This is typically called \"two dead and three\" or \"three ringers three\" for score keeping purposes.  Such occurrences are called \"dead ringers\" and are still used toward the pitcher/ringer average.  Back-yard games can be played to any number of points that is agreed upon, but are usually to 21 points, win by 2.  In most sanctioned tournaments the handicapped divisions pitch 50 shoe games, most points win.  If there is a tie, the pitchers pitch an additional 2 innings (alternating pitch) until the tie is broken.  Championship divisions, or non-handicapped divisions are pitched to 40 points, regardless of the number of shoes pitched.
